It is commonly found in South Africa. It is very rich in Vitamin B. The beer has a rather low alcohol content (usually less than 3%) and is known to have a heavy and distinctly sour aroma. In appearance, the beer is opaque and light tan in colour. It has a thick, creamy and gritty consistency (from the maize).\n\nUmqombothi is cheaper than commercial lager beers, that are brewed from barley and flavoured with hops flowers.\n\nUmqombothi is brewed following traditional customs and these vary slightly between regions. The recipe is often passed down through the generations. The beer is traditionally prepared over a fire outside of the house. It then passively cools to ambient temperatures outside the house.\n\nThe ingredients used are: equal measures of maize meal, crushed mealie malt (corn malt) and crushed sorghum malt. The maize malt provides a lighter-toned beer with a mellower flavour. The sorghum malt provides a darker beer. \n\nThe ingredients are mixed in a cast-iron pot, known as a potjie in South Africa. Four measures of warm water are added. The mixture is left overnight. The mixture starts fermenting and bubbles appear. A sour odour can be detected.\n\nA small portion of the wort is removed and put to one side. The remaining mash is cooked until a crusty sediment forms. This product is known as isidudu and can be eaten as a porridge. When making beer, the isidudu is left to cool for a day.\n\nAfter the mixture has cooled, it is poured into a large plastic vat. The wort that was set aside is added to the vat. A handful of sorghum malt and a handful of maize malt is added to the vat. The brew is stirred with a traditional stirring spoon called an iphini. The vat is covered with a lid and blanket (to retain heat). The vat is put in a warm place overnight, to encourage fermentation.\n\nThe traditional method of testing to see if the brew is ready is to light a match close to the vat. If the match blows out quickly, the brew is ready. If the match remains lit, the brew is not ready. This is because the fermenting mash produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, which does not allow for combustion of the match.\n\nWhen the brew is ready, the fermented mash is filtered through a large metal strainer, to remove the spent grains. The sediment at the bottom of the vat is known as intshela. The intshela is added to the strained beer, to give extra flavour.\n\nThe spent grains are squeezed out and are usually cast onto the ground for chickens. The brewer of the beer traditionally gives thanks to the ancestors while casting the corn.\n\nOnce the beer has been strained, it is poured into a large communal drum known as a gogogo. It is ready for sharing with friends and family. When guests arrive at the brewer's home to taste the beer and join in the celebration, they traditionally bring a bottle of brandy, as a symbol of gratitude.\nUmqombothi is used to celebrate the home-coming of young men known as \"abakwetha\" in Xhosa culture, after ulwaluko - initiation and religious male circumcision. \n\nThis beer plays a very important role when someone contacts their ancestors, the \"amadlozi\", and plays a central role in the social context and so is often used during customary weddings, funerals, and imbizos (traditional meetings).\n\nA recent study found sorghum and maize used as ingredients in umqombothi often are contaminated by mycotoxin-producing molds \"Aspergillus\" spp., \"Penicillium\" spp., \"Rhizopus\" spp. and \"Mucor\" spp. \n\nAlthough the finished beer is not contaminated with the fungi, 33% of commercially brewed sorghum beer contained aflatoxins and 45% of home-brewed beers contained zearalenone and/or ochratoxin A in the final product.\n\nThe Eastern Cape province of South Africa has a very high incidence of esophageal cancer. Research by the Medical Research Council in South Africa suggests mycotoxins in homegrown maize are linked to the high incidence of this cancer.\n\nIt is referred to in the song of the same name sung by Yvonne Chaka Chaka. The lyrics of the song call it a \"magic African beer.\" The song is heard in the opening of \"Hotel Rwanda\".\n\n"}

It is traditionally served cold but it can be eaten hot.\n\nRecipes for soup made of pureed leeks and potatoes were common by the 19th Century in France. In 19th century cookbooks, and still today, they are often named \"Potage Parmentier\" or \"Potage a la Parmentier\" after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, the French nutritionist and scholar who popularized the use of Potatoes in France in the 18th Century. The French military cookbook of 1938 includes a recipe for \"Potage Parmentier for 100 men\" using milk instead of cream but with proportions and directions that are similar to the recipe for \"Vichyssoise Soup\" given later by Julia Child. \n\nThe origins of the name Vichyssoise are a subject of debate among culinary historians; one version of the story is that Louis XV of France was afraid of being poisoned and had so many servants taste the potato leek soup that, by the time he tried it, the soup was cold, and since he enjoyed it that way it became a cold soup, Julia Child called it \"an American invention\", whereas others observe that \"the origin of the soup is questionable in whether it's genuinely French or an American creation\".\n\nLouis Diat, a French chef at the Ritz-Carlton in New York City who grew up in Montmarault in the Allier department near the spa resort town of Vichy, is most often credited with its (re)invention.

In 1930 the restaurant's menu changed from French to English, whereupon it was called \"Cream Vichyssoise Glacée\".\n\nEarlier, French chef Jules Gouffé created a recipe for a hot potato and leek soup, publishing a version in \"Royal Cookery\" (1869).\n\nIn Batman Returns, Bruce Wayne is served Vichyssoise by Alfred.\n\nIn Drake & Josh, Josh Nichols makes up the name \"Dr. Vichyssoise.\"\n\nIn The Dick Van Dyke Show, Sally Rogers calls Laura Petrie to ask for her recipe for cold Vichyssoise and date nut bread, in an attempt to distract Laura from watching Rob's television interview on Murdock's X-Ray.\n\n\n"}

The dish is strongly associated with the Japanese New Year and its tradition of \"osechi\" ceremonial foods. Zōni is considered the most auspicious of the dishes eaten on New Year's Day. The preparation of zōni varies both by household and region.\n\nZōni is written in the Japanese language using two \"kanji\" characters. Since the first, means \"miscellaneous\" or \"mixed\", and the second, , means \"simmer\" or \"boil\", it is thought that the word is derived from the fact that zōni consists of many miscellaneous items of food (such as mochi, vegetables and seafood) being boiled together. Formerly, amongst samurai society, the dish was referred to as \"烹雑\" (Hōzō) with also being an archaic term for \"to simmer\" or \"to boil\".\n\nIt is said that \"zōni\" finds its roots in samurai society cuisine. It is thought to be a meal that was cooked on field battles, boiled together with \"mochi,\" vegetables and dried foods, among other ingredients. It is also generally believed that this original meal, at first exclusive to samurai, eventually became a staple food of the common people. Zōni was first served as part of a full-course dinner (\"honzen ryōri\"), and thus is thought to have been a considerably important meal to samurai.\n\nThe tradition of eating \"zōni\" on New Year's Day dates to the end of the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The dish was offered to the gods in a ceremony on New Year's Eve.\n\nZōni has numerous regional variations in Japan. In many regions including the Kantō region, zōni consists of a clear soup called \"sumashi-jiru\" which is flavoured with \"dashi\", a stock made from flakes of dried bonito and/or kombu, and soy sauce. In the Kansai region and eastern Shikoku, zōni is made with a stock of white miso, while zōni in the part of Fukui Prefecture is made with a stock of red miso. In the Tottori-Izumo region, a variety of red bean soup is used for zōni.\n\nThe preparation of the \"mochi\" for the dish also varies by region. In the Kantō region and Tōhoku region, the \"mochi\" are cut into squares and grilled before being added to the stock. In the Kansai region and the Chūgoku region, a round, boiled mochi is generally preferred. In most of the Kyushu region, a round mochi is popular, but grill-boil difference changes depending on area. In some areas taro or tofu is used instead of mochi. This type of zōni is found on some islands or mountainous areas where rice is not grown to a large extent.\n\nCommon additions to the soup include chicken, fish or meatballs; leafy vegetables such as \"komatsuna\" or spinach; \"mitsuba\" (a Japanese herb similar to parsley); \"kamaboko\" such as \"naruto\" and carrot flakes for colour; and flakes of \"yuzu\" peel for its citrus fragrance. Regional specialties are often added. A sprinkle of seven-spice chili flakes (\"shichimi\") is sometimes added at the table.\n\n"}
{"id": "2443321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2443321", "title": "Illusionistic ceiling painting", "text": "Illusionistic ceiling painting\n\nIllusionistic ceiling painting, which includes the techniques of perspective di sotto in sù and quadratura, is the tradition in Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo art in which trompe l'oeil, perspective tools such as foreshortening, and other spatial effects are used to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on an otherwise two-dimensional or mostly flat ceiling surface above the viewer. It is frequently used to create the illusion an open sky, such as with the oculus in Andrea Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi, or the illusion of an architectural space such as the cupola, one of Andrea Pozzo's frescoes in Sant'Ignazio, Rome. Illusionistic ceiling painting belongs to the general class of illusionism in art—art designed to create accurate representations of reality.\n\nDi sotto in sù (or \"sotto in su\"), which means \"seen from below\" or \"from below, upward\" in Italian, developed in late Quattrocento Italian Renaissance painting, notably in Andrea Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi in Mantua and in frescoes by Melozzo da Forlì. Italian terminology for this technique reflects the latter artist's influence and is called \"prospettiva melozziana\", or \"Melozzo's perspective\". Another notable use is by Antonio da Correggio in the Duomo of Parma, which foreshadows Baroque grandeur.\n\nThe technique often uses foreshortened figures and an architectural vanishing point to create the perception of true space on a painted, most-often frescoed, ceiling above the viewer.\n\nQuadratura, a term which was introduced in the seventeenth century and is also normally used in English, became popular with Baroque artists. Although it can also refer to the \"opening up\" of walls through architectural illusion, the term is most-commonly associated with Italian ceiling painting. Unlike other \"trompe-l'oeil\" techniques or precedent \"di sotto in sù\" ceiling decorations, which often rely on intuitive artistic approaches to deception, \"quadratura\" is directly tied to seventeenth-century theories of perspective and the representation of architectural space. Due to its reliance on perspective theory, it more fully unites architecture, painting and sculpture and gives a more overwhelming impression of illusionism than earlier examples.\n\nThe artist would paint a feigned architecture in perspective on a flat or barrel-vaulted ceiling in such a way that it seems to continue the existing architecture. The perspective of this illusion is centered towards one focal point. The steep foreshortening of the figures, the painted walls and pillars, creates an illusion of deep recession, heavenly sphere or even an open sky. Paintings on ceilings could, for example, simulate statues in niches or openings revealing the sky.\n\nQuadratura may also employ other illusionistic painting techniques, such as anamorphosis.\n\nExamples of illusionistic painting include:\n\nOther examples were by Paolo Veronese at Villa Rotonda in Vicenza and Baldassare Peruzzi in the Villa Farnesina of Rome.\n\nItalian Renaissance artists applied their confidence in handling perspective to projects for ceilings and overcame the problems of applying linear perspective to the concave surfaces of domes in order to dissolve the architecture and create illusions of limitless space.\n\nPainted and patterned ceilings were a Gothic tradition in Italy as elsewhere; but the first ceiling painted to feign open space, was created by Andrea Mantegna, a master of perspective who went to Mantua as court painter to the Gonzaga. His masterpiece was a series of frescoes that culminated in 1474 in the Camera degli Sposi (bridal chamber) of the Ducal Palace. In these works, he carried the art of illusionistic perspective to new limits. He frescoed the walls with illusionistic scenes of court life, while the ceiling appeared as if it were an oculus open to the sky, with servants, a peacock, and cherubs leaning over a balustrade, seen in strongly foreshortened perspective from below—\"di sotto in sù\". This was the prototype of illusionistic ceiling painting that was to become an important element of Italian baroque.\n\nCorreggio at Parma took the illusionistic ceiling a step farther in his frescoes of Christ and the Apostles for the cupola at the San Giovanni Evangelista and in the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" in the dome of the Cathedral of Parma, which is Correggio's most famous work (1520–24); in these frescos Correggio treats the entire surface as the vast and frameless vault of heaven in which the figures float. In a visual continuity between the architectural interior and its painted surfaces, Corregio's clouds and figures appear to inhabit the same architectural space in which the spectator stands.\n\nIn Baroque Rome, the long-standing tradition of frescoed ceilings received a push from the grand projects in Palazzo Farnese under the guidance of Annibale Carracci and his team, but the figural subjects were still enclosed within multiple framed compartments (\"quadri riportati\"), and the perspective of subjects seen from below was not consistently taken into consideration.\n\nFrom 1625 to 1627 Giovanni Lanfranco, a native of Parma who knew Correggio's dome, painted the enormous dome of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle with an \"Assumption of the Virgin\" that overwhelmed contemporary spectators with its exuberant illusionistic effects and became one of the first high baroque masterpieces. Lanfranco's work in Rome (1613–1630) and in Naples (1634–1646) was fundamental to the development of illusionism in Italy.\n\nPietro Berrettini, called Pietro da Cortona, developed the illusionistic ceiling fresco to an extraordinary degree in works such as the ceiling (1633–1639) of the \"gran salone\" of Palazzo Barberini. From 1676 to 1679 Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Baciccio, painted an \"Adoration of the Name of Jesus\" on the ceiling of the Church of the Gesù, the Jesuit headquarters in Rome. From 1691 to 1694 Andrea Pozzo painted the \"Entrance of Saint Ignatius into Paradise\" on the nave vault of Sant'Ignazio, Rome, with theatricality and emotion.\n\n\n\n"}

Other names for this sauce include poor man's gravy, bird-eye gravy, bottom sop, cedar gravy, and red ham gravy. The gravy is made from the drippings of pan-fried country ham mixed with black coffee. The same drippings, when mixed with flour and milk creates the base for sausage gravy. Red-eye gravy is often served over ham, grits or biscuits.\n\nA common practice is to dip the inner sides of a split biscuit into the gravy in order to add flavor and keep the biscuit from being too dry when a piece of country ham is added between the two halves, sometimes called the Southern \"ham biscuit\". (The Appalachian ham biscuit is simply a biscuit with country ham.) Another popular way to serve red-eye gravy, especially in parts of Alabama, is with mustard or ketchup mixed in with the gravy. Biscuits are then dipped (\"sopped\" in Southern English) in the gravy.\n\nIn Louisiana, Cajun cuisine-style gravy is made with a roast beef instead of ham. Black coffee is always used, and it is frequently a strongly brewed coffee substitute made from chicory. The gravy is ladled over the meat on a bed of rice, staining the rice a dark brown color. Often, French bread and some kind of beans are also served as a side, like butter beans, lima beans, or peas.\n\nAnother variation is to use water with a bit of butter and season with red (cayenne) pepper.\n\nRed-eye gravy's name comes from its distinct appearance. Prepared traditionally, with coffee and grease combined in the final step (see Preparation below), a heterogeneous mixture forms with the water-based coffee sinking to the bottom and the oil-based grease forming the top layer. In a round bowl the mixture looks much like a red human eye. Use of red pepper enhances the redness of the appearance.\n\nLess traditional preparation techniques do not always result in the \"red eye\" appearance, leading to folk legends surrounding the origin of the name. For instance, one story is that former United States President Andrew Jackson requested ham with gravy as red as his cook's eyes, which were bloodshot from drinking the night before, or that the black coffee in the gravy will keep people awake.\n\nAfter a ham has been cooked, the grease is removed from the pan. Black coffee is then used to deglaze the pan. The coffee and grease are then poured into the same container in a one-to-one ratio.\n\nOther recipes exist, using water instead of coffee, or adding coffee with grease still present in the pan. When the coffee is added to the grease in this manner, a homogeneous mixture may result that lacks the \"red eye\" appearance.\n\nFlorida Crackers referred to tomato gravy as red-eye gravy, and prepare it in much the same way by adding flour and tomatoes to bacon grease. This is served with fried catfish or other fish.\n\n\n"}

Commemoration balls are held by different colleges each year, following a cycle by which each college holds a ball every three years.\n\nCommemoration Week is so known because of the ceremonies in commemoration of the benefactors of the university that are held then, namely the Commemoration Day sermon formerly held (until 2006) on the Sunday, and the Encaenia ceremony (where the annual Creweian Oration in honour of benefactors is given) and garden party on the Wednesday of that week. Commemoration Week was formerly one of two occasions when balls were traditionally held, the other being Eights Week, the 5th week of Trinity term when the Summer Eights rowing races occur. Eights balls are nowadays comparatively rare.\n\nThere is no formal definition of a Commemoration ball, but the usual Oxford convention is to refer only to the larger, triennial balls as Commemoration balls. The dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during Commemoration Week that they call summer balls or parties rather than Commemoration balls. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually black tie. Merton College holds a triennial winter ball, of which the next will be in 2019.\n\nIn the past, Commemoration balls were held \"night after night\" by different colleges during Commemoration Week. With many colleges now holding smaller annual summer balls, Commemoration balls are now held by only some of the larger colleges, who still follow the traditional triennial cycle. Oriel College hosts a ball in the first year of the three-year cycle, and until recently Magdalen College also did. However Magdalen College cancelled their ball in 2015 at the last minute downgrading to a smaller affair. Currently, in the second year, there are Commemoration balls held by New College and The Queen's College. In the third year, there are now four colleges with this honour (Worcester College, Christ Church, Trinity College, St. John's College).\n\nThe 2005 Christ Church Commemoration ball was the first to be held by that college for fifteen years because of an incident at the 1990 ball that led to the Governing Body suspending the ball and replacing it with an annual summer party until 2005. Until 1990 the three great Oxford choral foundations of Magdalen College (first year), New College (second year) and Christ Church (third year) held their \"white tie\" Commemoration Balls in consecutive years on a triennial basis, each being widely regarded as the most prestigious ball being held in Oxford in that year, but the 1990 incident at Christ Church upset the tradition as various other colleges claimed Christ Church's (third year) slot, and continue to do so after the Christ Church Ball was reinstated in 2005. The cancellation of Magdalen College's (first year) Commemoration Ball in 2015, and its reinstatement in the \"New College\" (second) year of 2016, completed the break with tradition. \n\nIn 2013, Balliol College held a Commemoration ball to mark the 750th Anniversary of the College's foundation, the first Commemoration Ball at Balliol since 1969. Similarly, the commemoration ball hosted by Worcester College on 27 June 2014 was the highlight of celebrations to mark the college's tercentenary.\n\n\nCommemoration ball organising committees generally seek to secure private performances from leading entertainers; some notable performances are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2446694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2446694", "title": "Znamenny chant", "text": "Znamenny chant\n\nZnamenny Chant () is a singing tradition used in the Russian Orthodox Church. Znamenny Chant is unison, melismatic liturgical singing that has its own specific notation, called the \"stolp\" notation. The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ' (, 'hooks') or ' (, 'signs'). Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation. Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness. There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called \"Stolpovoy\", \"Malyj\" (Little) and \"Bolshoy\" (Great) Znamenny Chant. Ruthenian Chant (Prostopinije) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the Muscovite Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.\n\nZnamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called \"Znamëna\" (Russian for \"marks\", \"banners\") or \"Kryuki\" (\"hooks\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. \n\nThe stolp notation was developed in Kievan Rus' as an East Slavic refinement of the Byzantine neumatic musical notation.\n\nThe most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than notes. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \"little dove\" (Russian: голубчик \"(golubchik)\"), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the Holy Ghost.\n\nAfter the fall of Kievan Rus' to the Mongols, the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in Novgorod), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\n\nGradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600, called \"red marks\" (Russian: киноварные знаки (\"kinovarnye znaki\")), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.\n\nThe use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the church reforms by Patriarch Nikon. From that time Western music started to penetrate into Russian culture, and the Russian-Orthodox Church introduced a \"Latin\", polyphonic way of singing, based on Polish, German and Italian harmonies. The term \"Latin\" however was considered derogatory, since it also referred to \"heretical Latin faith\". Znamenny Chant, however, has been preserved to a certain degree in the chanting traditions that are directly descended from it.\n\nF. Mark Mealing/Our People's Way/A Study inDoyikobr Hym,body & Folklife. U. Penna, 1972.\n\nCurrently, stolp notation (Znamenny signs) continues to be used by Russian Old Believers, mostly in combination with the above-mentioned \"red marks\", as shown in the first illustration. In the 19th century Edinovertsy, particularly outside Russia, have tried to move to the modern neumatic form of notation that tries to capture exact relations between pitches; and they currently use a standard linear notation.\n\nChanting traditions that preserve and/or are descended from the Znammeny chant include the following:\n\nThe Strochnoy chant (early Russian polyphony) was also based on Znamenny chant, and although it is not widely used in the church practice now, it can be occasionally performed by some choirs. Many Russian composers (Sergei Rachmaninov, Alexander Grechaninov, Vladimir Martynov) studied Znamenny chant and used it in their compositions. There are also many adaptations of Znamenny melodies for four-part choir, popular in both Russia and abroad.\n\nBecause Znamenny Chant requires a specific manner of performance, the chant books contain several instructions as to dynamics and tempo. For the Old Believers church chant also has an educational function: one has to sing in such a way that the sound astonishes the ear and the truth, enclosed in the chants, penetrates the heart. Znamenny performance practice excludes classical vocal training. Singers perform with their own, natural voices, sometimes in a style reminiscent of folk music. Znamenny Chant does not have any pauses or rests, and all chants are performed fluently. Ideally, singers will sing in such a way that their voices become united in one single voice. \nOriginally Znamenny Chant was performed only by male voices. Today, on account of the small number of people able to sing at church services and the evolution of the tradition, it is usually performed by both male and female voices.\n\n\n"}

Due to their virtually undivided storefronts and 24-hour service at the original Halsted Street location of both stands, Jim's Original and Express Grill had an added element of confusion for the casual observer not attentive to the change in signage a matter of feet in distance. Despite the competition, the Maxwell Polish sausage sandwich soon grew to be one of Chicago's most popular local offerings, along with the Chicago-style hot dog and the Italian beef sandwich.\nDue to the University of Illinois Chicago's South Campus development the Maxwell Street market district was razed and the two stands moved in 2005. After decades of coexisting at the intersection of Halsted and Maxwell Streets, the two have relocated their side-by-side competition a half block east onto Union Avenue, adjacent to the Dan Ryan Expressway on-ramp at Roosevelt Road.\n\nMaxwell Polish are a staple of hot dog stands and today are found throughout the city and suburbs, including at restaurant chains such as Portillo's and Brown's Chicken, and is available at most sports venues in the area serving concessions. Most of the 24-hour stands (such as the original Express Grill and its neighboring competition, Jim's Original) also serve the pork chop sandwich popularized alongside the Polish sausage sandwich during the days of the old Maxwell Street market.\n\nThe main feature of the sandwich is the sausage, which is widely available in grocery and specialty retail stores throughout the Chicago area. It is typically marketed as the \"Maxwell Street\" variety, which is a Chicago-specific variation of \"kielbasa\" distinguished by it being typically more seasoned and made from a combination of both beef and pork. The two largest manufacturers of this particular style of Polish sausage in Chicago are Vienna Beef and the Bobak's Sausage Company.\n\n\n"}

The cheese is still made in the traditional manner by the Benedictine monks of the Abbaye Notre-Dame de Belloc, in the commune of Belloc in the Ariège department of southwestern France. Production of this Ossau-Iraty cheese is regulated by A.O.C. laws. Abbaye is produced from the milk of a centuries-old breed of red-nosed Manech ewes, particular to the Basque region, delivered by farms neighboring Belloc Abbey. It is believed that these Benedictine monks were the first to teach shepherds from the Basque region how to make cheese many centuries ago. Abbaye de Belloc has a pleasantly nutty and complex flavor that is characteristic of Basque, and is made in a 5 kg fat wheel with a natural, crusty, brownish colored rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. This semi-firm cheese has a dense, rich and creamy texture and a distinctive lanolin aroma. Careful attention under the correct maturing conditions accentuates this cheese's rich, caramelized flavors, which sometime resemble burnt caramel, that can make Abbaye de Belloc so addictive. It pairs particularly well with Pinot Noir, as it is mild enough not to overwhelm the subtleties of this delicate varietal, but also has sufficient complexity to stand up to the bolder flavors of a Syrah/Shiraz.\n"}

The word, or the slogan \"À la lanterne!\" (in English: To the Lamp Post!) gained special meaning and status in Paris and France during the early phase of the French Revolution, from the summer of 1789. Lamp posts served as an instrument to mobs to perform extemporised lynchings and executions in the streets of Paris during the revolution when the people of Paris occasionally hanged officials and aristocrats from the lamp posts. The English equivalent would be \"String Them Up!\" (British) or \"Hang 'Em High!\"(American)\n\n\"La Lanterne\" became a symbol of popular or street justice in revolutionary France. The slogan \"À la lanterne!\" is referred to in such emblematic songs as Ça Ira (\"les aristocrates à la lanterne!\" means \"aristocrats to the lamp-post!\" in this context). Journalist Camille Desmoulins, who had earlier practiced law, designated himself \"The Lantern Attorney.\" He wrote a pamphlet entitled (in translation) \"The Lamp Post Speaks to Parisians,\" in which \"la lantèrne\" tells the people, \"I've always been here. You could have been using me all along!\". As the revolutionary government became established, lamp posts were no longer needed as execution instruments, being replaced by the guillotine which became infamous in Paris during 1792-1794, though all major French cities had their own.\n\nHanging people from lamp posts ceased to be a part of Paris rebellions in the 19th Century.\n\nThe first prominent victim of lynching \"à la lanterne\" was Joseph Foullon de Doué, an unpopular politician who replaced Jacques Necker as a Controller-General of Finances in 1789. On 22 July 1789, the mob attempted to hang him on a lamp post, however, after the rope broke, he was beheaded and radicals marched with his head on a pike through the streets. \"If [the people] are hungry, let them eat grass,\" he is said to have once proclaimed, although the claim is unsubstantiated. Because Foulon, an aristocrat administrator of the royal government, was in charge of the Paris markets. Foulon was known for his coldheartedness towards the needs of the common French people; he was suspected of controlling Paris' food supply and, thereby, keeping food prices unaffordable. So hated that he had even staged his own funeral to escape the people's wrath, the 74-year-old Foulon had spent years growing rich at his post while the poor starved. On 22 July 1789, he was captured by an angry Paris crowd, who stuffed Foulon's mouth with grass, then summarily hanged him from the boom of a lamp post at The Place de Grève, in front of the town hall (L'Hôtel de Ville). But the rope broke, and Foulon was hanged again and again before he was dropped to the ground and decapitated. His head, its mouth still full of grass, was placed on a pike—a long, sharpened, wooden pole—and paraded through the streets. Later that day, Foulon's son-in-law, Louis Bénigne François Bertier de Sauvigny, was taken to the Place de Grève and hanged there, from the lamp post. De Sauvigny's severed head was placed on a pike of its own. Those bearing the pikes put the two severed heads together and chanted, \"Kiss Daddy!\" \n\nImmediately following the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 two of the \"invalids\" (veteran soldiers) forming part of the garrison of the fortress were hanged in the Place de Grève, although it is not recorded whether \"lanternes\" were used for the purpose. \n\nParticularly the lamp post standing at the corner of the Place de Grève and the Rue de la Vannerie served as an improvised gallows. The reason for that was partly symbolic: the lantern was placed opposite the Hôtel de Ville (Paris City Hall), directly under the bust of Louis XIV, so that \"popular justice could take place right under the eyes of the king\".\n\nIn August 1789, journalist and politician Camille Desmoulins wrote his \"\", a defense of lynchings in the streets of Paris. Desmoulins was nicknamed \"Procureur-général de la lanterne\" (Attorney-General of the Lamp-post).\n\nOn 21 October 1789, a hungry Parisian mob dragged François the Baker (Denis François) out of his shop and hanged him from a lamp post, apparently because he had no bread to sell. Street lynching, instigated by various factors, has gradually became an effective tool for the ends of the Jacobins.\n\nOn 14 December 1790, the crowd hanged barrister Pascalis and chevalier de La Rochette from a lamp post in Aix-en-Provence. The advocates of street justice cried \"À la lanterne! À la lanterne!\" shortly before the lynching.\n\nOn 20 June 1792, a mob broke into the Tuileries and threatened the queen Marie Antoinette. Her lady-in-waiting Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan reported that in the crowd \"there was a model gallows, to which a dirty doll was suspended bearing the words \"\"Marie-Antoinette a la lanterne\"\" to represent her hanging\".\n\nIn 1919, Max Pechstein, a German expressionist painter, created a poster for the magazine \"An die Lanterne\" (À la lanterne). The poster depicts, among other things, a man hanging from a rope on a lamp post.\n\n\n"}

At the time of its introduction in 2001, Amp Energy was initially distributed under the Mountain Dew soft drink brand. Since 2009, it has been produced and labeled under its own stand-alone trademark name. The beverage is packaged in both 16-ounce and 24-ounce cans, and is sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Lebanon. As of 2009, Amp Energy was the number four energy drink brand in the U.S. in terms of overall retail sales.\n\nThe original formulation of Amp Energy was positioned as a flavor extension of the Mountain Dew brand, and in 2001 its label read \"\"Amp Energy Drink from Mountain Dew\".\" In 2008, the label design was changed to contract the product name to a more concise \"\"Amp Energy\"\", with the Mountain Dew logo being shifted to the lower portion of the cans. In Amp's 2011 redesign, the Mountain Dew logo was taken off the cans completely. According to beverage industry commentators at the time, this labeling update was enacted with the intent of \"placing a stronger emphasis on the 'Amp Energy' brand and less on its Mountain Dew roots\". Amp Energy Original contains taurine, B-vitamins, guarana, ginseng and maltodextrin. 8.4 fluid ounces of Amp contains 74 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nThe Amp Energy product line has since expanded to a broader range of flavors and variants, which as of 2011 included Amp Energy (Original), Sugar Free, Overdrive (cherry), Relaunch (discontinued) (orange), Elevate (mixed berry), Traction (grape), Green Tea, Lightning (lemonade) and Sugar Free Lightning, and watermelon. Traction has since been renamed to Boost. There was also a limited edition flavor named Tradin Paints which was an Orange/Lime/Berry drink. In February 2010 a new series of juices was launched under the name Amp Energy Juices, which are made with B-vitamins, taurine, ginseng and guarana. These juices are produced in two flavors: Orange and Mixed Berry, and are packaged in 12-ounce bottles. Also introduced at this time was Amp Energy Gum, which is made from a blend of B-vitamins, taurine and caffeine.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, Amp Energy officially announced that it will re-introduce its Orange flavor.\n\n2018 also introduced new flavors.\n\nAn 'Amp' branded citrus-flavoured energy drink distributed by Britvic under license from PepsiCo. launched in the UK in August 2013. The United Kingdom version of Amp Energy is released under the 'Mountain Dew' brand with a UK-unique new logo. This is similar to its early release in North America, with the Amp logo featuring the text 'Powered by Mountain Dew' beneath it. Amp Energy — Powered by Mountain Dew features a higher caffeine content than Mountain Dew Energy at 31 mg/100ml. It also contains real sugar as is common with other UK soft drinks.\n\nAmp Energy was the title sponsor for the inaugural NHL Winter Classic outdoor game on New Year's Day 2008.\n\nAmp Energy sponsored Kevin Lepage's No. 61 Peak Fitness Racing Ford for the 2006 Daytona 500. In 2008, Amp Energy began sponsoring NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his No. 88 car. In 2009, Amp Energy released Tradin’ Paint, a limited edition Earnhardt Jr.-themed energy drink which was a combination of three flavors: orange, lime and berry. The product was available in 16-ounce cans and featured the same paint scheme as Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 88 Amp Energy/National Guard Chevrolet car. In late 2011, PepsiCo withdrew its Amp Energy sponsorship, replacing it with Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nPepsiCo has sponsored the Talladega Superspeedway race for multiple years, resulting in the race being titled the \"Amp Energy 500\" in 2008 and 2009, and the \"AMP Energy Juice 500\" in 2010. In October 2010, Amp Energy Juice produced a short film about Talladega Superspeedway titled \"The Legend of Hallowdega\" which starred David Arquette, directed by Terry Gilliam and included appearances by Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Darrell Waltrip. The sponsorship ended in 2011 as the race is now known as the Good Sam Club 500.\n\nAmp Energy sponsors a snowboard team which includes athletes Mason Aguirre, Keir Dillon, Kevin Pearce, Jack Mitrani, Luke Mitrani and Scotty Lago. In 2009, Amp Energy joined Burton Snowboards to sponsor the 27th Annual US Open Snowboarding Championships at Stratton Mountain in Vermont. Other snowboarding events in which Amp Energy is a primary sponsor include the Burton Am Series, Burton Demo Tour, Burton World Tour, and the Canadian Open Snowboarding Championships.\n\nA 2009 promotion involved graphic designers, musicians and artists creating custom Amp-branded refrigerators which were placed in designers' homes and retail stores that included Crooks and Castles, Rogue Status, Huf Clothing and Reed Space. Designers that participated in the promotion included Topher Chin, Steve Aoki, Omar Epps and Han Cholo. According to Women’s Wear Daily, this initiative was carried out “as part of Pepsi's bid to recast the image of its Amp Energy drink as the beverage of choice for the fashion, art and lifestyle crowd.” In 2010, Amp Energy became the official energy drink of the World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) series, before the WEC went defunct in the same year.

It was the name given to stakes carried by Roman legionaries for employment as a field fortification, sometimes also called vallus. It is frequently, but incorrectly, called a pilum murale meaning 'wall spear'.\n\nThe stakes were carried by Roman legionaries; typically two were carried by each soldier.\n\nEach stake was made of hardwood, usually oak, about long and about wide at the thickest point. Square in section, the shape tapers to a point at both ends. The central part is narrowed in a way that strongly suggests the function of a handle, although this may not be its actual purpose. Examples that have been found are rough hewn.\n\nIt seems clear that the stakes were used to form a temporary defence. However, the exact manner in which stakes were used is the subject of debate among experts.\n\nIt is possible that the stakes were incorporated into the ramparts of a Roman marching camp (\"castra\"). Projecting from the ramparts at an angle, they would present a barrier to an attacker attempting to climb up. Alternatively, they could have been placed vertically at the top of the rampart as a fence. Experiments with reconstructions have been disappointing in that such barriers are not strong, as the symmetry of the stakes makes them easy to pull out of the ground.\n\nIt has been proposed that the stakes were lashed in pairs at intervals along a log or beam to form a \"Cheval de frise\". This could be used, for example, as a moveable barrier to bar a gateway. Alternatively, three stakes might be roped together into a defence resembling the Czech hedgehog — a sort of giant caltrop. Defences of this type, employed en masse, can be pushed aside only with difficulty and cannot be collapsed. The advantage of such suggested modes of use is that they are consistent with the symmetry of the stakes and account for the \"hand grip\" at the centre which is required to bind the stakes together.\n\nIn the Battle of Mount Algidus (458 BC), Cincinnatus ordered his men to provide twelve \"valli\" each, and used them to build a fortification around the Aequi, who were, at the time, surrounding another Roman army.\n\n"}

A few such freelance decorators of faience operated in Nuremberg in the late 17th century, but \"hausmalerei\" developed in Augsburg into a notable feature of tin-glazed earthenware production during the early 18th century, before the workshops turned entirely to porcelain. \n\n\"Hausmalerei\" reached a artistic pinnacle with paintings on Meissen porcelain and Vienna porcelain in the second quarter of the 18th century; sometimes Meissen porcelains remained blank for decades before they were painted. Many painters and workshops have distinctive styles; a few were amateurs.\n\nIn France, the production of Sèvres porcelain was tightly controlled, so that painting was under strict factory control. By contrast, Limoges porcelain has always maintained a strong tradition of \"atelier\" decoration, whether near Limoges or at Paris.\n\nIn England, among independent porcelain-painters of the mid-18th century, William Duesbury went on to manufacture porcelain as a founder of the Royal Crown Derby and owner of manufactories at Bow, Chelsea, Derby and Longton Hall. In England, America and elsewhere, china painting became a popular hobby or semi-professional pastime in the mid-19th century, normally for ladies, and many factories sold blanks. The 204-piece Canadian Historical Dinner Service of 1897 represents a peak of this trend, with 16 female artists, most from middle-class backgrounds, taking part in decorating the service.\n\nTraditions of \"hausmalerei\" were never wholly extinguished. The founder of Heinrich & Co began as a \"hausmaler\", purchasing porcelain blanks until he set up his own kilns \"ca\" 1903. From 1930 the Czech \"hausmaler\" Josef Kuba (1896-1972) maintained an atelier in Karlsbad, Czech Republic, and later in Wiesau, Bavaria. supplied by various porcelain manufacturers in Bavaria.\n\nAfter the disturbances of the Russian Revolution many pre-revolutionary blanks of the Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg were painted by artists as long as ten years later, in bold new Constructivist styles; such pieces are now highly sought-after.\n\nChinese Canton porcelain of the 18th and 19th centuries used a similar system, but on a larger scale. The blanks were Jingdezhen porcelain which was carried the considerable distance to Guangzhou before being decorated. \n"}

Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons. In some cultures, such as Japanese society, and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter.\n\nSome cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with Africa time. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised. In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm.\n\nIn cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting. In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in econometrics and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in queueing theory.of English\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2473210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2473210", "title": "Sterile neutrino", "text": "Sterile neutrino\n\nSterile neutrinos (or inert neutrinos) are hypothetical particles (neutral leptons – neutrinos) that interact only via gravity and do not interact via any of the fundamental interactions of the Standard Model. The term \"sterile neutrino\" is used to distinguish them from the known \"active neutrinos\" in the Standard Model, which are charged under the weak interaction.\n\nThis term usually refers to neutrinos with right-handed chirality (see right-handed neutrino), which may be added to the Standard Model. Occasionally it is used in a general sense for any neutral fermion, instead of the more cautiously vague name neutral heavy leptons (NHLs) or heavy neutral leptons (HNLs).\n\nThe existence of right-handed neutrinos is theoretically well-motivated, as all other known fermions have been observed with both left and right chirality, and they can explain the observed active neutrino masses in a natural way. The mass of the right-handed neutrinos themselves is unknown and could have any value between 10 GeV and less than 1 eV.\n\nThe number of sterile neutrino types (should they exist) is not yet theoretically established. This is in contrast to the number of active neutrino types, which has to equal that of charged leptons and quark generations to ensure the anomaly freedom of the electroweak interaction.\n\nThe search for sterile neutrinos is an active area of particle physics. If they exist and their mass is smaller than the energies of particles in the experiment, they can be produced in the laboratory, either by mixing between active and sterile neutrinos or in high energy particle collisions. If they are heavier, the only directly observable consequence of their existence would be the observed active neutrino masses. They may, however, be responsible for a number of unexplained phenomena in physical cosmology and astrophysics, including dark matter, baryogenesis or dark radiation. In May 2018, physicists of the MiniBooNE experiment reported a stronger neutrino oscillation signal than expected, a possible hint of sterile neutrinos.\n\nExperimental results show that all produced and observed neutrinos have left-handed helicities (spin antiparallel to momentum), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only helicities (and chiralities) included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.\n\nRecent experiments such as neutrino oscillation, however, have shown that neutrinos have a non-zero mass, which is not predicted by the Standard Model and suggests new, unknown physics. This unexpected mass explains neutrinos with right-handed helicity and antineutrinos with left-handed helicity: Since they do not move at the speed of light, their helicity is not relativistic invariant (it is possible to move faster than them and observe the opposite helicity). Yet all neutrinos have been observed with left-handed \"chirality\", and all antineutrinos right-handed. Chirality is a fundamental property of particles and \"is\" relativistic invariant: It is the same regardless of the particle's speed and mass in every inertial reference frame. Although note that a particle with mass that starts out left-handed can develop a right-handed component as it travels – chirality is \"not\" conserved in the propagation of a free particle.\n\nThe question, thus, remains: Do neutrinos and antineutrinos differ only in their chirality? Or do exotic right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos exist as separate particles from the common left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos?\n\nSuch particles would belong to a singlet representation with respect to the strong interaction and the weak interaction, having zero electric charge, zero weak hypercharge, zero weak isospin, and, as with the other leptons, no color, although they do have a B-L of −1. If the standard model is embedded in a hypothetical SO(10) grand unified theory, they can be assigned an X charge of −5. The left-handed anti-neutrino has a B-L of +1 and an X charge of +5.\n\nDue to the lack of electric charge, hypercharge, and color, sterile neutrinos would not interact electromagnetically, weakly, or strongly, making them extremely difficult to detect. They have Yukawa interactions with ordinary leptons and Higgs bosons, which via the Higgs mechanism lead to mixing with ordinary neutrinos. \nIn experiments involving energies larger than their mass they would participate in all processes in which ordinary neutrinos take part, but with a quantum mechanical probability that is suppressed by the small mixing angle. That makes it possible to produce them in experiments if they are light enough. \nThey would also interact gravitationally due to their mass, and if they are heavy enough, could explain cold dark matter or warm dark matter. In some grand unification theories, such as SO(10), they also interact via gauge interactions which are extremely suppressed at ordinary energies because their gauge boson is extremely massive. They do not appear at all in some other GUTs, such as the Georgi–Glashow model (i.e. all its SU(5) charges or quantum numbers are zero).\n\nAll particles are initially massless under the Standard Model, since there are no Dirac mass terms in the Standard Model's Lagrangian. The only mass terms are generated by the Higgs mechanism, which produces non-zero Yukawa couplings between the left-handed components of fermions, the Higgs field, and their right-handed components. This occurs when the SU(2) doublet Higgs field formula_1 acquires its non-zero vacuum expectation value, formula_2, spontaneously breaking its SU(2) × U(1) symmetry, and thus yielding non-zero Yukawa couplings:\n\nSuch is the case for charged leptons, like the electron; but within the standard model, the right-handed neutrino does not exist, so even with a Yukawa coupling neutrinos remain massless. In other words, there are no mass terms for neutrinos under the Standard Model: the model only contains a left-handed neutrino and its antiparticle, a right-handed antineutrino, for each generation, produced in weak eigenstates during weak interactions. (See neutrino masses in the Standard Model for a detailed explanation.)\n\nIn the seesaw mechanism, one eigenvector of the neutrino mass matrix, which includes sterile neutrinos, is predicted to be significantly heavier than the other.\n\nA sterile neutrino would have the same weak hypercharge, weak isospin, and mass as its antiparticle. For any charged particle, for example the electron, this is not the case: its antiparticle, the positron, has opposite electric charge, among other opposite charges. Similarly, an up quark has a charge of + and (for example) a color charge of red, while its antiparticle has an electric charge of − and a color charge of anti-red.\n\nSterile neutrinos allow the introduction of a Dirac mass term as usual. This can yield the observed neutrino mass, but it requires that the strength of the Yukawa coupling be much weaker for the electron neutrino than the electron, without explanation. Similar problems (although less severe) are observed in the quark sector, where the top and bottom masses differ by a factor of 40.\n\nUnlike for the left-handed neutrino, a Majorana mass term can be added for a sterile neutrino without violating local symmetries (weak isospin and weak hypercharge) since it has no weak charge. However, this would still violate total lepton number.\n\nIt is possible to include both Dirac and Majorana terms: this is done in the seesaw mechanism (below). In addition to satisfying the Majorana equation, if the neutrino were also its own antiparticle, then it would be the first Majorana fermion. In that case, it could annihilate with another neutrino, allowing neutrinoless double beta decay. The other case is that it is a Dirac fermion, which is not its own antiparticle.\n\nTo put this in mathematical terms, we have to make use of the transformation properties of particles. For free fields, a Majorana field is defined as an eigenstate of charge conjugation. However, neutrinos interact only via the weak interactions, which are not invariant under charge conjugation (C), so an interacting Majorana neutrino cannot be an eigenstate of C. The generalized definition is: \"a Majorana neutrino field is an eigenstate of the CP transformation\". Consequently, Majorana and Dirac neutrinos would behave differently under CP transformations (actually Lorentz and CPT transformations). Also, a massive Dirac neutrino would have nonzero magnetic and electric dipole moments, whereas a Majorana neutrino would not. However, the Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are different only if their rest mass is not zero. For Dirac neutrinos, the dipole moments are proportional to mass and would vanish for a massless particle. Both Majorana and Dirac mass terms however can appear in the mass Lagrangian.\n\nIn addition to the left-handed neutrino, which couples to its family charged lepton in weak charged currents, if there is also a right-handed sterile neutrino partner (a weak isosinglet with zero charge) then it is possible to add a Majorana mass term without violating electroweak symmetry. Both neutrinos have mass and handedness is no longer preserved (thus \"left or right-handed neutrino\" means that the state is mostly left or right-handed). To get the neutrino mass eigenstates, we have to diagonalize the general mass matrix formula_4:\n\nwhere formula_6 is big and formula_7 is of intermediate size terms.\n\nApart from empirical evidence, there is also a theoretical justification for the seesaw mechanism in various extensions to the Standard Model. Both Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) and left-right symmetrical models predict the following relation:\n\nAccording to GUTs and left-right models, the right-handed neutrino is extremely heavy: formula_9 10 to 10 GeV, while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to\n\nThis is the seesaw mechanism: as the sterile right-handed neutrino gets heavier, the normal left-handed neutrino gets lighter. The left-handed neutrino is a mixture of two Majorana neutrinos, and this mixing process is how sterile neutrino mass is generated.\n\nThe production and decay of sterile neutrinos could happen through the mixing with virtual (\"off mass shell\") neutrinos. There were several experiments set up to discover or observe NHLs, for example the NuTeV (E815) experiment at Fermilab or LEP-l3 at CERN. They all led to establishing limits to observation, rather than actual observation of those particles. If they are indeed a constituent of dark matter, sensitive X-ray detectors would be needed to observe the radiation emitted by their decays.\n\nSterile neutrinos may mix with ordinary neutrinos via a Dirac mass after electroweak symmetry breaking, in analogy to quarks and charged leptons.\nSterile neutrinos and (in more-complicated models) ordinary neutrinos may also have Majorana masses. In the type 1 seesaw mechanism both Dirac and Majorana masses are used to drive ordinary neutrino masses down and make the sterile neutrinos much heavier than the Standard Model's interacting neutrinos. In some models the heavy neutrinos can be as heavy as the GUT scale (). In other models they could be lighter than the weak gauge bosons W and Z as in the so-called νMSM model where their masses are between GeV and keV. A light (with the mass ) sterile neutrino was suggested as a possible explanation of the results of the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment.\nOn 11 April 2007, researchers at the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab announced that they had not found any evidence supporting the existence of such a sterile neutrino. More-recent results and analysis have provided some support for the existence of the sterile neutrino.\n\nTwo separate detectors near a nuclear reactor in France found 3% of anti-neutrinos missing. They suggested the existence of a fourth neutrino with a mass of 1.2 eV. Sterile neutrinos are also candidates for dark radiation. Daya Bay has also searched for a light sterile neutrino and excluded some mass regions. Daya Bay Collaboration measured the anti-neutrino energy spectrum, and found that anti-neutrinos at an energy of around 5 MeV are in excess relative to theoretical expectations. It also recorded 6% missing anti-neutrinos. This could suggest that sterile neutrinos exist or that our understanding of neutrinos is not complete.\n\nThe number of neutrinos and the masses of the particles can have large-scale effects that shape the appearance of the cosmic microwave background. The total number of neutrino species, for instance, affects the rate at which the cosmos expanded in its earliest epochs: more neutrinos means a faster expansion. The Planck Satellite 2013 data release is compatible with the existence of a sterile neutrino. The implied mass range is from 0–3 eV. In 2016, scientists at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory did not find any evidence for the sterile neutrino. However, in May 2018, physicists of the MiniBooNE experiment reported a stronger neutrino oscillation signal than expected, a possible hint of sterile neutrinos.\n\n\n"}

The term \"baryon\" is derived from the Greek \"\"βαρύς\"\" (\"barys\"), meaning \"heavy\", because, at the time of their naming, it was believed that baryons were characterized by having greater masses than other particles that were classed as matter.\n\nUntil a few years ago, it was believed that some experiments showed the existence of pentaquarks – baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark. The particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely by 2006. On 13 July 2015, the LHCb collaboration at CERN reported results consistent with pentaquark states in the decay of bottom Lambda baryons (Λ).\n\nSince baryons are composed of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such do not participate in the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks.

{"id": "2501039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2501039", "title": "Lucky Lager", "text": "Lucky Lager\n\nLucky Lager is an American lager with U.S. brewing and distribution rights held by the Pabst Brewing Company, and Canadian brand ownership held by Labatt Brewing, which is now part of AB InBev. Originally launched in 1934 by the San Francisco-based General Brewing Company, Lucky Lager grew to be one of the prominent beers of the West during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe General Brewing Company was founded in San Francisco, California by Eugene Selvage (who would remain owner and CEO until 1961).[1][2][3] Eugene teamed up with Paul C. von Gontard, a grandson of Aldophus Busch, and German brewmaster Julius Kerber, to launch a state of the art brewery that could brew beer that rivaled those made in Europe. Lucky Lager, the first beer of General Brewing Company, was commercially introduced in 1934. That same year, General Brewing Company also formed a strategic partnership with Coast Breweries in Vancouver Island, British Columbia as part of a consortium of several Canadian breweries. The General Brewing company expanded and opened Lucky Lager Brewing Company, a second brewery in Azusa, California in 1949. Later in the 50s and 60s, the expansion also reached Vancouver (WA) and Salt Lake City (UT).\n\nLucky Lager was launched in San Francisco via a series of newspaper ads, billboards, and advertisements on street cars. The ads announced Lucky would be a beer of high quality and would follow the tradition of German beers - being made with high-quality ingredients, in a high-quality brewery, and with thorough aging. It was launched to significant fanfare and grew steadily, becoming the #2 selling beer in California by 1937. Starting in 1935, Lucky encouraged people to take the taste test and that they would choose Lucky.\n\nThe General Brewing Company invested $1,000,000 to open its first brewery in San Francisco. It was planned and designed by Frederick H. Meyer, San Francisco architect, in partnership with George L. Lehle, a brewery engineer from Chicago. This construction was the most modern brewery of its time, with a capacity of 100,000 barrels per year and capabilities of doubling production. By brewing just Lucky Lager, the General Brewing Company achieved a record of selling its entire daily production since the beginning of operations. The main reason for its success with consumers was the high beer quality, which came from the aging the beer adequately unlike many of its post-Prohibition competitors of the time. Moreover, the production was set up in a way that no hands touched the beer or its container until the final step (bottling). In that sense, General Brewing Company posted a bond of $1,000 as a guarantee that the age-date of the beer was authentic.\n\nAfter WWII, General Brewing began rapid expansion to meet increasing demand. This included expanding into Azusa, California in 1949, Vancouver, Washington in 1950, and Salt Lake City, Utah in 1960.\n\nThe following decade, from 1950-1960 saw Lucky Lager grow to be the sales leader in the entire West.[1] This was coupled with continued distribution expansion in an effort to saturate the western market. By 1962, Lucky Lager was producing and selling over two million barrels of beer per year.\n\nIn 1958, Coast Breweries was purchased by Labatt Brewery, which continued to brew Lucky Lager.\n\nLucky Lager Brewing Company changed its name back to General Brewing between 1963 and 1969, and then changed its name to Lucky Breweries, Inc. in 1969. As the national brands moved into California in the early 1960s, Lucky Lager’s sales began to falter. In an effort to increase sales with younger drinkers, this led to the ill-fated introduction of King Snedley's Beer, an alternate brand in addition to Lucky. According to some accounts, King Snedley's was just Lucky Lager repackaged with a different brand and marketed toward counterculture consumers. The new brand flopped and was withdrawn from the market, though it would reappear briefly in 1975. As sales continued to decline, the Salt Lake City brewery was closed in 1967.[5]\n\nIn 1971, millionaire beer baron Paul Kalmanovitz bought Lucky Lager Brewing and again changed the name back to General Brewing Company. The Azusa, CA brewery was closed immediately. The San Francisco brewery was closed in 1978. This left Vancouver, WA and Cranston, RI as the only locations where Lucky Lager was brewed. In the late 1970s, General Brewing took advantage of the \"generic brand\" marketing craze in the US by producing beer with plain white labels emblazoned with the word BEER. Rumors surfaced that BEER was simply repackaged Lucky Lager. When the generic craze died, and the microbrewery movement took off, General had difficulty maintaining profitability as a brewer of inexpensive beers. The fact that Lucky Lager tasted no worse than expensively-advertised \"premium\" brands such as Budweiser or Miller did not impress a market of drinkers where image was frequently more important than taste. The brewery's fortunes began to decline.\n\nAfter the Vancouver, WA brewery shut down in July 1985, the Olympia Brewing Company in Tumwater, WA began to produce Lucky Lager in the US. In July 2003, this brewery was also closed. Lucky Lager continued to be sold in its original Northern California range at Lucky Stores supermarkets, which although not affiliated, sold Lucky Lager as an unofficial value store brand, until Lucky Stores supermarkets were bought out by Albertson's and the name of the supermarkets was changed around 2000.\n\nLucky was actually brewed on Vancouver Island in Victoria until 1982, when Labatt Breweries of Canada moved off the Island and tore down the brewery to prevent any competition on the Island. Labatt now brews Lucky out of Edmonton, Alberta in the same brewery where they produce Budweiser for all of Western Canada. In 1995, Labatt was purchased by Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew was then purchased by Brazilian brewing giant AmBev in 2004 and the company became Inbev. On 13 July 2008, Inbev merged with Anheuser-Busch, making AB InBev the current owners of the Lucky Lager brand in Canada. Brewing and distribution rights in the United States are owned by the Pabst Brewing Company.\n\nLucky is commonly found all across Southern British Columbia. Labatt markets Lucky Lager as a budget brand in Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario.\n\nLucky Lager was once famous for its 11 oz stubby bottles featuring a rebus under the cap. Since the closure of the Tumwater brewery, this famous bottle has been discontinued.[citation needed]\n\nRebus puzzles use pictures to represent words or parts of words within a phrase. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lucky Lager, along with other brands controlled by beer magnate, Paul Kalmanovitz, featured rebus puzzles on the underside of their bottle caps to engage consumers.\n\nLucky Lager’s marketing strategy also relied strongly on its packaging and label. In 1939, the Pacific Advertising Club Association granted Lucky Lager the highest award for the most distinctive beer package. The history of the label started with the design of the very distinctive red cross, with a circle in the center with the printed date of the beer, and the words \"Lucky Lager\" printed on both arms of the cross. The label was distinctive from traditional beer brands because of its simplicity and how easy it was to remember. It covered the whole surface of the can and, when piled, the combination of the crosses culminated in a sophisticated design. This design by Charles Stafford Duncan, the art director of the McCann Erickson advertising agency in San Francisco, also won the Altman Prize of the National Academy of Design.\n\nThe original label for Lucky Lager has seen many changes. The large red cross was made less prominent in the 1950s, but it remained on the labels and on advertising. The label was redesigned and the cross was again made smaller in 1962, although it was still the design's focus. A subsequent design in the late 60s got rid of the cross entirely and replaced it with a large cursive \"L\". With the rise of premium beer, lead by Coors and Millers, Lucky Lager changed the logo in an attempt to maintain itself relevant in the beer market. With the subsequent decline and end of Lucky Lager in the US, the beer continues to operate with an ever-changing identity under the control of Labatt, owners of the brand rights in Canada.\n\nThe original advertising for the Lucky Lager brand centered on the large X emblem present on packaging and other marketing material, including the \"Bonded Beer\" slogan and age-dated beer canning. Lucky Lager was the first beer to include the date the beer was brewed on the can. This remained a central tenet of its advertising through the 1970s.\n\nOne of the more unusual promotions was the \"Talking Package\". It was a robot made of Lucky Beer containers: its body was a beer barrel, the neck, arms and legs were made of beer cans, and the head and feet were large bottles. One hand held a beer bottle as well. Inside was a microphone and a speaker. An operator hid nearby where he could see the people in front of the robot. Spectators could go up to the \"talking package\" and ask him questions about Lucky Lager and the Lucky robot would respond.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, one of the key brand slogans was \"It's Lucky when you live in California.\" It was seen on many billboards throughout California. As its distribution footprint grew, it became \"It’s Lucky when you live in America\".\n\nLabatt Brewing Company declared Cumberland, BC to be the \"Luckiest Town in Canada\" in early 2002 due to its incredible rate of consumption.\n\nLucky Lager provided endorsements and advertising for the San Francisco Seals throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 1950s. It garnered endorsements from Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler and tennis star Jack Kramer during the 1950s.\n\nLucky also sponsored a well-loved popular music radio show called \"Lucky Lager Dance Time\". It ran with local DJs but the same playlist across California, so people could listen to the same music while they were driving. It also sponsored various sports recaps and other programs.\n\nIn the 1960s, Lucky Lager Brewing Company sponsored the Lucky International Open. Lucky's 1963 McCann Erickson ad campaign included the song \"Go Lively: Get Lucky\", by Richard Adler.[4]\n\nLucky, like most other beer brands at the time, was present both on the radio, in print, and on TV. Early commercials for Lucky featured a vaudeville song and dance number and labeled Lucky as \"Aged Just Right\". Other ads featured cartoons detailing the improvements of Lucky Draft over other light beers and emphasizing the aging and superior quality of Lucky. Most of their ads before 1965 featured imagery that is iconic with the West (beaches, ranches, and mountains). Much of this imagery was echoed in their print advertising.\n\nIn the 1956 film \"Please Murder Me\", a Lucky Lager billboard is in the background in one scene.\n\nIn the 1961 film \"The Exiles\", the characters are drinking Lucky Lager and local liquor stores are advertising the sale of Lucky Lager. The brand also appears in the bar room brawl scene in the 1968 movie \"The Devil's Brigade\". In the 1968 film \"Vixen!\", Lucky Lager is being consumed in the backwoods of British Columbia.[citation needed]\n\nJack Nicholson's character drinks Lucky Lager during the 1970 movie Five Easy Pieces. In the film The Bad News Bears (1976), the Walter Matthau character gives the team Lucky Lagers to celebrate a win. Cans of Lucky Lager appear in the film \"The Van\", being sold out of a cooler at a van show. In the 1993 film \"Kalifornia\", Lucky Lager is the favorite drink of the Brad Pitt character.\n\nLucky Lager is featured in the 1982 Black Flag video \"TV Party\".[citation needed]\n\nIn the television show Greg the Bunny, a Lucky Lager sign appears in the 'Rabbit Redux' episode.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1965 film \"A Patch of Blue\" a Lucky beer truck appears in one scene.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2505631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2505631", "title": "Coney Island hot dog", "text": "Coney Island hot dog\n\nA Coney Island Hot Dog (or Coney Dog or Coney) is a hot dog in a bun topped with a savory meat sauce and sometimes other toppings. It is often offered as part of a menu of dishes of Greek origin and classic American 'diner' dishes and often at Coney Island restaurants. It is largely a phenomenon related to immigration from Greece and Macedonia to the United States in the early 20th century.\n\n\"Virtually all\" Coney Island variations were developed, apparently independently, by Greek or Macedonian immigrants in the early 1900s, many fleeing the Balkan Wars, who entered the US through Ellis Island in New York City. Family stories of the development of the dishes often included anecdotes about visits to Coney Island.\n\nIn 1913 the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce in New York had banned the use of the term \"hot dog\" on restaurant signs on Coney Island, an action prompted by concerns about visitors taking the term literally and assuming there was dog meat in the sausage. Because of this action by the Chamber of Commerce, immigrants passing through the area didn't know the sausage in a bun by the American moniker \"hot dog.\" Instead, the handheld food would have been known to immigrants as a \"coney island.\"\n\nThe name coney can be traced back over a hundred years as a 48 acre peninsula in County Down, Northern Ireland inhabited by small rabbits called conies. The hamlet was later called Coney Island albeit was not really an island. It eventually became a park and offered many amenities for entertainment and food. As Irish immigrants moved to the United States some entrepreneurs wanted to copy the same type of park. As the original Coney Island started in New York other unrelated Coney Islands opened in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nAs the legend goes, one particular vender of Vienna sausage sandwiches, later called Weiners then hot dogs decided to dress up the hand held sandwiches with chili, onions and several other items. They came to be known as Coney Islands. While chili dogs are known throughout the country, it seems the original name has stuck in the Cincinnati, Ohio area as several hundred chili parlors sells what is simply called a Coney today.\n\nFt. Wayne's Famous Coney Island Wiener Stand was opened in 1914 by three now-unknown Macedonian immigrants. Vasil Eschoff, another Macedonian immigrant, purchased an interest from one of the original owners in 1916. Eschoff's descendants have operated the restaurant since. The Coney Island in Fort Wayne is described as a small, fatty pink hot dog with a \"peppery-sweet\" coney sauce on a soft bun. However, the ground beef-based coney sauce at Ft. Wayne's Famous Coney Island Wiener Stand has the flavor and consistency of a mild peppered savory pork sausage, reflecting its Macedonian heritage. The small hot dog is grilled on a flattop, placed in a steamed bun, yellow mustard applied, then a few teaspoonfuls of the savory chili sauce are added which is then topped with chopped yellow onion.\n\nJane and Michael Stern, writing in \"500 Things to Eat Before it's Too Late\", note that \"there's only one place to start [to pinpoint the top Coney Islands], and that is Detroit. Nowhere is the passion for them more intense.\" James Schmidt, in a debate at the 2018 National Fair Food Summit, noted that \"Detroit is synonymous with the Coney Dog: you simply cannot have one without the other.\" \n\nThe Coney Island developed in Michigan is a natural-casing beef or beef and pork European-style \"Wiener Würstchen\" (Vienna sausage) of German origin, topped with a beef heart-based sauce, one or two stripes of yellow mustard and diced or chopped onions. The variety is a fixture in Flint, Detroit, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and southeastern Michigan. The style originated in the early 20th century, with competing claims from American and Lafayette Coney Islands (1917) in Detroit, and Todoroff's Original Coney Island (1914) in Jackson. The longest continuously operated Coney Island (in the same location) is in Kalamazoo (1915).\n\nIn Detroit historically many Greek and Macedonian immigrants operated Coney islands, or restaurants serving Detroit Coney dogs. By 2012 many Albanians began operating them as well. The Greeks established Onassis Coney Island, which has closed. Greek immigrants established the Coney chains Kerby's Koney Island, Leo's Coney Island, and National Coney Island during the 1960s and early 1970s. All three chains sell some Greek food items with Coney dogs. Detroit style sauce is a bean-less chili sauce, differing from the chili dogs they offer only in the lack of beans. National has most of its restaurants on the east side of the city, and Kerby's and Leo's have the bulk of their restaurants on the west side of the Detroit area.\n\nFlint style is characterized by a dry hot dog topping made with a base of ground beef heart, which is ground to a consistency of fine-ground beef. Some assert that in order to be an \"authentic\" Flint coney, the hot dog must be a Koegel coney and the sauce by Angelo's, which opened in 1949. However, the sauce was originally developed by a Macedonian in 1924, Simion P. (Sam) Brayan, for his \"Flint's Original Coney Island\" restaurant. Brayan was the one who contracted with Koegel Meat Company to make the coney they still make today, also contracting with Abbott's Meat to provide the fine-grind beef heart sauce base. Abbott's still makes Brayan's 1924 sauce base available to restaurants and the public through the Koegel Meat Company and Abbott's Meats. Restaurants then add chopped onions sautéed in beef tallow, along with their own spice mix and other ingredients, to Abbott's sauce base to make their sauce.\n\nPopular folklore perpetuates a myth that a Flint coney sauce recipe containing ground beef and ground hot dogs is the \"original\" Flint Coney sauce recipe. Variations on this story include either that a relative of the storyteller knew or worked with the former owner of Flint's Original and received the recipe from them, or that the wife of the owner of Flint's Original allowed the publication of the recipe in the Flint Journal after his death. Ron Krueger, longtime food writer of the Flint Journal, included it in a collection of recipes from the newspaper but without a cited source, unlike the rest of the recipes in the collection. When asked about this Mr. Krueger replied, \"That recipe appeared in The Journal several times over the years. [I don't] think I ever saw it in the context of a story or ever saw any attribution. It always included the word 'original' in the title, but anybody who knows anything knows otherwise.\" As to the second myth of Brayan's wife later allowing the publication of the recipe, Velicia Brayan died in 1976, while Simion Brayan lived until the age of 100 and died in 1990. The actual source of this recipe appears to be an earlier Flint Journal Food Editor, Joy Gallagher, who included the recipe in her column of May 23, 1978. In that column she stated she had included the recipe in an even earlier column. Her apparent source was \"a woman who said she was the wife of a chef at the original Coney Island, and that she copied the recipe from his personal recipe book.\" Gallagher stated \"I believe her\". However, Gallagher also wrote, \"I'm not making any claims\". In the same column she also included a second recipe that used beef heart, which she wrote \"came to me recently from a reader who swears it is the sauce served at Angelo's.\" The folklore has mixed the supposed sources of the two recipes in this column from Gallagher, with people claiming the ground hot dog recipe is reportedly from Angelo's. In his column published in the Flint Journal on April 18, 1995, Food Editor Ron Krueger reported taking Gallagher's ground hot dog recipe directly to Angelo's co-owner Tom V. Branoff, who refuted the recipe line-by-line. Gallagher's pre-1978 column is still being researched.\n\nJackson style uses a topping of either ground beef or ground beef heart, onions and spices. The sauce is traditionally a thick hearty one whether ground beef or ground beef heart is used. This meat sauce is applied on a quality hotdog in a steamed bun and then topped with diced or chopped onions and a stripe of mustard. The Todoroffs' restaurants were some of the earlier locations for Jackson coneys beginning in 1914. However, those locations are now closed. The company currently manufactures and distribute their coney sauce for retail purchase at supermarkets or other restaurants. There are several other coney restaurants in the area, most notably Jackson Coney Island and Virginia Coney Island, both of which are located on East Michigan Avenue in front of the train station near where the original Todoroff's restaurant was located. These restaurants all use a blend of onion and spices similar to Todoroff's but use ground beef heart instead of ground beef for the coney sauce. The Jackson style was late to the usage of beef heart in the sauce, using ground beef prior to converting to ground beef heart in the early 1940s. Jackson takes their coneys very seriously. Each year Jackson Magazine or the Jackson Citizen Patriot have a best coney contest voted on by residents for all the restaurants in the area.\n\nConey Island Kalamazoo was founded in 1915, and is the longest continuously operated Coney Island in the state. Their coney island is made up of a topping made from their own recipe served on a Koegel's Skinless Frankfurter. Koegel's wasn't founded until 1916, and it's unknown which hot dog Coney Island Kalamazoo used prior to the Skinless Frankfurter's development.\n\nThe following meatpackers provide Coney dogs and European-style Vienna sausage (\"Frankfurter Würstel\") to restaurants and consumers in Michigan:\n\nMany Coney Island restaurants make their own sauces from scratch. However, the different styles of sauces are also available from the following meatpackers:\n\nGreek immigrant Gus Saites opened his Original Coney Island in Duluth in 1921. The hot dog used is the Vienna Beef from Chicago, which is topped with the restaurant's own coney sauce, with options of mustard, onion, and for a small fee, cheese. The Superior Street location also offers sport peppers as a topping. The decor includes a copy of their 1959 menu showing coney islands were 25 cents each.\n\nThe Original Coney Island Restaurant and Bar, operated by the Arvanitis Family since 1923 in a former Civil War armory, is the oldest remaining business in St. Paul, though now open only on special occasions.\n\nIn Grand Forks, North Dakota the three location Red Pepper taco chain (including one in Fargo, North Dakota) offer their Coney Dogg (spelled with two 'g's). The hot dog is relatively large at . It's topped with a ground beef-based topping known as a \"mexi meat\" which, unlike most coney island toppings, is a thick and mildly sweet Mexican chili. It's then finished with a pile of finely-shredded Colby cheese.\n\nIn Cincinnati, a \"coney\" is a hot dog topped with Cincinnati chili, usually with mustard and chopped onions. A \"cheese coney\" adds a final topping of shredded cheddar cheese. The dish was developed by Macedonian immigrants Tom and John Kardjieff, founders of Empress Chili, in 1922. The coney topping is also used as a topping for spaghetti, a dish called a \"two-way\" or chili spaghetti. there were over 250 \"chili parlors\" in Cincinnati serving coneys. The two largest chains today are Skyline Chili and Gold Star Chili. Arguably the most famous is Camp Washington Chili, which is called out by Jane and Michael Stern as their top pick in Cincinnati.\n\nTony Packo's Cafe in Toledo, OH serves their own style of coney dog, the \"Hungarian dog.\" This was made famous on the television show MASH. It is actually not made with a hot dog, but half of a Hungarian sausage.\n\nConeys are on restaurant menus throughout Tulsa and were originally created there by Greek immigrants. Jane and Michael Stern write that \"Oklahoma is especially rich in classic coneys\" and call out the Coney I-Lander, writing they \"perfectly deliver the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney's soul.\" Oklahoma coneys are small hot dogs on steamed buns with a spicy-sweet dark brown chili sauce, onions, and optional cheese and hot sauce.\n\nJames Coney Island operates a number of locations in the area of Houston, Texas. The company was founded in 1923 by two Greek immigrant brothers, James and Tom Papadakis; the former being the company's namesake.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A direct descendant of earlier cakes known as American pudding-cake pie and Washington pie, the dessert was referred to as chocolate cream pie, Parker House chocolate cream pie, and finally Boston cream pie on Parker House's menus. The cake consisted of two layers of French butter sponge cake filled with thick custard and brushed with a rum syrup; its side was coated with the same custard overlaid with toasted sliced almonds, and the top coated with chocolate fondant.

Slice was also reintroduced in India by PepsiCo in 2008 as a Mango-flavoured fruit drink and currently advertised as Tropicana Slice.\n\nSlice was a big success upon release, inspiring other juice-infused drinks based on already existing juice brands, such as Coca-Cola's Minute Maid orange soda and Cadbury Schweppes's Sunkist. By May 1987, Slice held 3.2 percent of the soft drink market. One year later, it had fallen to 2.1 percent and was below 2 percent in June 1988.\n\nThe original design of the can was a solid color related to the flavor of the drink. These were replaced in 1994 with black cans that featured colorful bursts related to the flavor of the drink, along with slicker graphics. In 1997, the cans became blue with color-coordinated swirls. The original orange flavor was reformulated around this time with the new slogan, \"It's orange, only twisted.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2000, lemon-lime Slice was replaced in most markets by Sierra Mist, which became a national brand in 2003. The rest of the Slice line was replaced in most markets by Tropicana Twister Soda in the summer of 2005.\n\nIn early 2006, Pepsi resurrected the Slice name for a new line of diet soda called Slice ONE.

Taffy is made by stretching or pulling a sticky mass of boiled sugar, butter or vegetable oil, flavorings, and colorings until it becomes aerated (meaning that tiny air bubbles are produced, resulting in a light, fluffy and chewy candy). When this process is complete, the taffy is rolled, cut into small pastel-colored pieces and wrapped in wax paper to keep it soft. It is usually fruit-flavored, but other flavors are common as well, including molasses and the \"classic\" (unflavored) taffy.\n\nSalt water taffy is a late 19th century appellation which most likely originated in New Jersey, United States, and has become a common souvenir of many coastal resort towns. Modern commercial taffy is made primarily from corn syrup, glycerin and butter. The pulling process, which makes the candy lighter and chewier, consists of stretching out the mixture, folding it over and stretching it out again. Although it is called \"salt water\" taffy, it does not include any seawater but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture. In the local Philadelphia dialect, the term \"taffy\", without \"salt water\" before it, used to refer to a lollipop.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, chews are shaped pieces of candy very similar to soft toffee but without the caramel flavoring or brown color; popular brands of chew include Chewits and Starburst.\n\nCaramel candies are sometimes referred to as taffy (taffy apples), but are very different from common salt water taffy.\n\nNational taffy day is on May 23rd.\n"}

The English word \"Calendar\" also has its root in this word.\n\nThe capital of Wales, Cardiff, holds Calennig celebrations at the Cardiff Civic Centre to welcome in the New Year, including free live music, fairground rides, a midnight fireworks display and an opportunity to ice-skate into the new year at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland.\n\nThe tradition of giving gifts and money on New Year's Day is an ancient custom that survives even in modern-day Wales, though nowadays it is now customary to give bread and cheese.\n\nMany people give gifts on New Years morning, with children having skewered apples stuck with raisins and fruit. In some parts of Wales, people must visit all their relatives by midday to collect their Calennig, and celebrations and traditions can vary from area to area. In \"Stations of the Sun\", Ronald Hutton gives an example the following examples of Calennig rhyme from 1950s Aberystwyth,\n\"Dydd calan yw hi heddiw,<br>\"\n\"Rwy'n dyfod ar eich traws<br>\"\n\"I 'mofyn am y geiniog,<br>\"\n\"Neu grwst, a bara a chaws.<br>\"\n\"O dewch i'r drws yn siriol<br>\"\n\"Heb newid dim o'ch gwedd;<br>\"\n\"Cyn daw dydd calan eto<br>\"\n\"Bydd llawer yn y bedd\".<br>\n\nRonald Hutton also notes that in the south-east of Wales and in the Forest of Dean area, the skewered apple itself was known as the Calennig, and in its most elaborate form consisted of \"an apple or orange, resting on three sticks like a tripod, smeared with flour, stuck with nuts, oats or wheat, topped with thyme or another fragrant herb and held by a skewer.\"\n\nSimilarly, Fred Hando in his 1944 book \"The Pleasant Land of Gwent\", reproduces an illustration of a Calennig seen at Devauden and quotes his friend Arthur Machen:\n\nWhen I was a boy in Caerleon-on-Usk, the town children got the biggest and bravest and gayest apple they could find in the loft, deep in the dry bracken. They put bits of gold leaf upon it. They stuck raisins into it. They inserted into the apple little sprigs of box, and they delicately slit the ends of hazel-nuts, and so worked that the nuts appeared to grow from the ends of the holly leaves ... At last, three bits of stick were fixed into the base of the apple tripod-wise; and so it borne round from house to house; and the children got cakes and sweets, and-those were wild days, remember-small cups of ale.\n\nMachen traces the Calennig to the Roman Saturnalia and suggests that the custom was brought to Caerleon by the Romans.\n"}

When referring to traditions from \"Tawrat\", Muslims did not only identify it with the Pentateuch, but also with the other books of the Old testament, Talmudic- and Midrashim writings.\n\nThe word Tawrat occurs eighteen times in the Quran and the name of Musa is mentioned 136 times in the Quran, nowhere in the Quran is written that Moses alone has been given Tawrat, but at the contrary it is written in Quran that the prophets governed with Tawrat.\nAs per Quran the governing ayats containing an order of God are Tawrat.\nThe Law mentioned in Quran (5:45)\nSimilarly it is mentioned in the Exodus\nAccording to 7:157, Muhammad is written about in both the Injil (Gospel), revelations to Jesus (Isa) and the Tawrat,\nThe Tawrat is mentioned as being known by Isa in 5:110.\nSome quotations are repeated from other books of the Hebrew Bible. An example of this is 48:29,\nThis could be repeated from Psalms:\n\nBecause he believed the Quran replaced it, Muhammad did not teach from the Torah but referenced it heavily. He did say that Moses was one of the few prophets to receive a revelation directly from God, that is, without an intervening angel. On one occasion, it is recorded that some Jews wanted Muhammad to decide how to deal with their brethren who had committed adultery. Abu Dawood recorded:\n\nThere is some ambiguity among English speaking Muslims on the use of \"Tawrat\" versus \"Torah\". The Arabic of the Quran and hadith have only one word, \"Tawrat\". Generally, in English, they are used interchangeably. However, some Muslims prefer to reserve \"Tawrat\" to refer only to the original revelation of God to Moses which Muslims believe was later corrupted maybe through the Babylonian captivity, and the rewriting of Ezra (Uzair) (and the men of the Great Assembly.) However it is not possible to state without any authentic sources as to where, when and by whom the Torah was changed since the Quran mentions Uzair by name in chapter 9 verse 30 and does not say that he corrupted the Torah in this verse it cannot be said that Uzair did so.\n\nThere is also ambiguity as to whether the Quran uses \"Tawrat\" only referring to the five books of Moses, the entire Tanakh, or both, as in Hebrew. This comes because the Quran often lists the holy books as the Tawrat, Injil, and Quran, excluding the Zabur (the Psalms), possibly because the Psalms are part of the Tanakh. This meaning is uncommon, as most Muslims think it only refers to the five books of Moses.\n\nThe word Torah occurs eighteen times and the name of Moses is mentioned 136 times in the Quran. Nowhere in the Quran is written that Moses alone taught by the Torah as all succeeding Hebrew prophets and seers, including Aaron (Harun), used the Law for preaching. The Quran states that the Torah did have words of wisdom in it, and all subsequent prophets, priest, rabbis and sages in Israel used its Law for guidance for prophets in plural and not only for Moses alone.\n\nThe Quran mentions that the basic aspects of Islamic law are evident in the earliest scriptures, including that of Moses. He mentions that it contains the information about the Last Day and about the concepts of Paradise (Jannah) and Hell (Jahannam). The Torah is also mentioned as being known by Jesus.\n\n\n"}

Weroances were under a paramount chief called Powhatan. The Powhatan Confederacy, encountered by the colonists of Jamestown and adjacent area of the Virginia Colony beginning in 1607, spoke an Algonquian language. Each tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy was led by its own weroance. Most foreign writers who have come across a weroance only did so on a special occasion. This is the case because a foreigners presence was special. John Smith noted that there are few differences between weroances and their subjects.\n\nIn older texts, especially from the time of the early Jamestown settlers, spelling was not standardized, so the following spellings are used in different texts:\nA weroansqua is a female ruler. Spellings of this word also vary.\n\nParamount chiefs let their district and subordinate weroances make the final decision on how to handle a hostile situations. This was made apparent with the events that took place in 1607 and the hostility with the newcomers (English settlers). Weroances and Priest were the only ones allowed to enter into religious temples. A weroance did not go to meet any visitor, visitors were escorted to see a weroance. The weroance, their wives, and councilors often dressed in the finest jewels, and tanned deer skin.\n\nSeveral of the weroances' personal names were known and some recorded by William Strachey and other sources. The names of their respective chieftaincies were also commonly used as titles, exactly analogous to European peerages, so that the Weroance of Arrohattec (whose given name was Ashaquid) was often referred to simply as \"Arrohattec\", much as the Earl of Essex would be referred to just as \"Essex\" in lieu of a personal name.\n\nWhen the English arrived in Virginia, some of the weroances subject to the paramount chief Powhatan, or \"mamanatowick\" (Wahunsenacawh) were his own nearest male relatives:\n\n\nIn Powhatan society, women could inherit power, because the inheritance of power was matrilineal. In \"A Map of Virginia\" John Smith of Jamestown explains:His <nowiki>[</nowiki>Chief Powhatan's] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely Opitchapan, Opechancanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters.

{"id": "2526869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2526869", "title": "Rafida", "text": "Rafida\n\nRafida, also transliterated as Rafidah, is an Arabic word (collective plural ; multiple plural ; singular ) meaning \"rejectors\", \"rejectionists\", \"those who reject\" or \"those who refuse\". The word is derived from the Arabic consonantal root ر ف ض (\"r-f-ḍ\"), which as a verb means \"to reject\". The non-collective singular form is \"rāfiḍī\" \"one who rejects\".\n\nThe term is used contemporarily in a derogatory manner by Sunni Muslims, who refer to Shias as such because Shias do not recognize Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman as the legitimate successors of Muhammad, and hold Ali as to be the first successor.\n\nThe term \"rafida\" followed the Shi'a from a very early period, originating, according to one source, in the uprising of Zayd ibn Ali against the Umayyad Caliphate. \"Rafida\" referred to those Kufans who deserted and refused to support Zayd, who had a policy not to condemn the first two Rashidun Caliphs, saying he never heard his family call them bad names. Zayd ibn Ali considered Ali the most supreme after Muhammad, but refused to condemn the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar for diplomatic purposes in his uprising to increase his support. He viewed the caliphate of Abu Bakr & Umar as a test from God to see if people would reject Ali's authority. \n\nThe meaning of the term went through several changes over time. According to Zaydi sources, the term used by Zayd ibn Ali against some Kufans was not related to their rejection of the Abu Bakr & Umar, but it was for their rejection of Zayd ibn Ali's claim to Imamate because they considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the Imam instead. \nHe said: \"Allah is the Greatest! I swear by Allah, you all are the Rafidites mentioned by the Messenger of Allah in his statement:((After me there will be a people who will reject the jihad with the good of the Ahl al-Bayt and they will say that there is no commanding the good or forbidding the evil! They will mimic in the religion and follow their whims …)).\"\n\nDuring the time of the Umayyad and Abbasid Sunni leaders, it became a popular pejorative term for Twelvers, intended to recall their rejection of the first Sunni Rashidun, namely Abu Bakr, \nUmar, and Uthman. \n\nIn modern times, the term \"rafida\" is primarily used in Salafi jihadism such as ISIS to justify their execution of Shias.\n\nThere is much debate of the exact origin of \"rafida\". One example of an early instance is from the \"Maḥāsin\" of Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Barqī, who died in 888 CE. A section of the \"Maḥāsin\" reveals occasions of the use of \"rafida\" ascribed to Ja'far al-Sadiq:A man came to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq saying that someone had warned him against becoming a Rafidhi and Imam Ja'far replied \"By Allah, this name which Allah has granted you is excellent, as long as you follow our teaching and do not attribute lies to us.\" Muhammad al-Baqir also mentioned an instance when he pointed at himself stating \"I am one of the Rafidha.\"\n\nMughira ibn Shu'ba is said to have coined the term \"rafida\" against those who had rejected him.\n\nOthers refer to another historical text for its origin. Ja'far al-Sadiq believed that \"rafida\" was an honorific given first by God and preserved in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament: he mentioned that there were 70 men among the people of Pharaoh who rejected him and his ways and rather joined Moses, and God called those 70 men \"Rafida\". They were referred to in the army of Moses as al-Rafida because they rejected the Pharaoh and were intense in their worship and their love for Moses, Aaron, and their offspring. \n\nAl-Sadiq further states that Allah revealed to Moses, \"Establish this name for them in the Torah, for I have named them with it and gifted it to them.\" He extends the usage of the word to include the Shi'a of the family of Muhammad. \n\nThe Twelvers believe that after the death of Muhammad, they were the only ones who rejected evil, making them the successors of the original Rafida._ \n\nThey considered their rejection of evil to be leaving the power of Zayd ibn 'Ali and staying true to the ways of Ali. However, the term does not appear in the Qur'an. There are also those who insist that \"rafida\" was mentioned in the original texts, but the enemies later deleted the context that included \"rafida\".\n\nRumi (Mawlana) in his Masnavi (Title of the Story in Book V, poem 844) refers to the inhabitants of Sabzawar (in present-day Iran) as Rafizis among whom one cannot find a person named Abu Bakr. This is from the earliest extant copy of the Masnavi, dated 677 H Gh (1279 Gregorian) which is considered the most reliable by, e.g., B. Forouzanfar and R.A. Nicholson.\nThe fourteenth-century Sunni traveler Ibn Battuta used it in his description of the Alawis, considered by many as a ghulat sect, during his visit to Syria in 1326. The term continues to be used in this way today. \"Rafida\" was also sometimes used to indicate extremists and \"ash-Shi'i\" for moderates.\n\nAt certain points, the Shi'i decided to turn this negative term that was being used against them daily and turn it into something positive. The Shi'is sometimes designated themselves as Rawafid, which is someone who refuses; it's also a derogatory term applied by the Sunnis to describe the Shi'is who refused to accept the early caliphates. They decided to refer to themselves a Rawafid since it gave them a sense of pride because the revolted against Umayyad tyranny. Through the years, Rafida was transformed within the Shi'i world from an abusive nickname into a name signifying special praise, making it a positive term. Not only did they use the word as honorific amongst the community, they furthered the positive term by writing it into ancient history stories where they had always rejected evil, not turned towards evil.\n\nAs defined by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, the Shia first developed Kaysanism, which in turn divided into three major groupings known as Fivers, Seveners and Twelvers. The non-Zaydis are called \"Rafida\" by the Zaydis, when they were separated from the rest of the Shia.\n\nIn their ongoing campaign to unseat the government of Iraq and the government Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well Syrian opposition rebels frequently uses the term \"rafidah\" to refer to Shia Muslims. Alawaites, are referred to as 'Nusayri'. In the 13th edition of the ISIS magazine \"Dabiq\" the feature article is entitled, \"The Rafidah: From Ibn Saba’ to the Dajjal\" and contains, \"pages of violent rhetoric directed against Shiites\" who it claims are, \"more severely dangerous and more murderous...than the Americans\". The article justifies the killing of Shia Muslims, who ISIS claim are apostates.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia today, Shias are referred to as Rafidha. In Iraq, anti-Shi'a material is still surfacing. A discourse was released after improvement by the name of \"The Rafida in the Land of Tawhid\", which included orders by a member of the Higher Council, to kill Shi'is.\n\nUntil 1993, schoolbooks in Saudi Arabia openly denounced the Shia Islam and referred to the Shi'as rafida in the books. The curriculum was changed after protests and rafida is no longer used in the text books; the Islamic Shi'a beliefs are still however denounced in the books.\n\n\n"}

In Slovenia, it is called \"cesarski praženec\" or \"šmorn\". Its Hungarian name is \"császármorzsa\"; its Czech name is \"(Císařský) trhanec\" or \"kajzršmorn\".\n\nThe name \"Kaiserschmarren\" is a compound of the words \"Kaiser\" (emperor) and \"Schmarren\" (a scrambled or shredded dish). \"Schmarren\" is also a colloquialism used in Austrian and Bavarian to mean trifle, mishmash, mess, rubbish, or nonsense. The word \"Schmarren\" is related to \"scharren\" (to scrape) and \"schmieren\" (to smear [see \"schmear\"]).\n\nKaiserschmarren is a light, caramelized pancake made from a sweet batter using flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and milk, baked in butter. Kaiserschmarren can be prepared in different ways. When making Kaiserschmarren the egg whites are usually separated from the yolk and beaten until stiff; then the flour and the yolks are mixed with sugar, and the other ingredients are added, including: nuts, cherries, plums, apple jam, or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and slivered almonds. The last mentioned ingredients (nuts, cherries, plums, apple jam, or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and chopped almonds) aren't in the original recipe and just additions made by some cooks based on their personal preferences. In the original recipe there are only raisins (which, before cooking, are soaked in rum).\n\nThe pancake is split with two forks into pieces while frying and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar, then served hot with apple or plum sauce or various fruit compotes, including plum, lingonberry, strawberry, or apple. Kaiserschmarren is eaten like a dessert, or it can also be eaten for lunch at tourist places like mountainside restaurants and taverns in the Austrian Alps, as a quite filling meal.\n\nTraditionally, Kaiserschmarren is accompanied with \"Zwetschgenröster\", a fruit compote made out of plums.\n\nLike the closely related dish Sterz the \"Schmarrn\" derived from the simple but hearty cuisine of the alpine regions, there are different versions like Erdäpfelschmarrn (with potatoes), Äpfelschmarrn (with apples) or Kirschschmarren (with cherries),usually prepared on an open fireplace of a so-called \"Rauchkuchl\". The Kaiserschmarrn is simply a more refined and richer version of this former staple food, which sometimes consisted of only flour and lard.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the dish was first prepared for the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I (1830–1916). There are several stories. One apocryphal story involves the Emperor and his wife, Elisabeth of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach. Obsessed with maintaining a minimal waistline, the Empress Elisabeth directed the royal chef to prepare only light desserts for her, much to the consternation and annoyance of her notoriously austere husband. Upon being presented with the chef's confection, she found it too rich and refused to eat it. The exasperated Francis Joseph quipped, “Now let me see what 'Schmarren' our chef has cooked up.” It apparently met his approval as he finished his and even his wife's serving.\n\nAnother story is that Francis Joseph and his wife were traveling the Alps and stopped by a farmer's home for lunch. The farmer was so nervous that he threw all the fanciest ingredients he had into a pan to make a delicious pancake; worse yet, due to his nervousness and shaky hands he scrambled the pancake. Hoping to cover up the mess he then covered it with plum jam. Luckily, the kaiser thought it was scrumptious.\n\nAnother popular tale is that his wife was a poor cook and couldn't flip a pancake efficiently.

The curse occurs in the Book of Genesis and concerns Noah's drunkenness and the accompanying shameful act perpetrated by his son Ham, the father of Canaan (). The controversies raised by this story regarding the nature of Ham's transgression, and the question of why Noah cursed Canaan when Ham had sinned, have been debated for over 2,000 years.\n\nThe story's original purpose may have been to justify the subjection of the Canaanite people to the Israelites, but in later centuries, the narrative was interpreted by some Christians, Muslims and Jews as an explanation for black skin, as well as a justification for slavery. Nevertheless, most Christians, Muslims and Jews now disagree with such interpretations, because in the biblical text, Ham himself is not cursed, and race or skin color is never mentioned.\n\nFor a period in its history the Latter Day Saint movement used the curse of Ham to prevent the ordination of black men to its priesthood.\n\nThe concept of the Curse of Ham finds its origins in Genesis 9:\n<poem>\n20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.\n22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.\n23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\n24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.\n25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\n26 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n\nThe objective of the story may have been to justify the subject status of the Canaanites, the descendants of Ham, to the Israelites, the descendants of Shem. The narrative of the curse is replete with difficulties: It is uncertain what the precise nature of Ham's offense is. Verse 22 has been a subject of debate, as to whether it should be taken literally, or as \"a euphemism for some act of gross immorality\". In verse 25, Noah names Shem and Japheth as the \"brethren\" (the New Living Translation reads \"relatives\") of Canaan, seven verses after indicating that they were Canaan's uncles. The Table of Nations presents Canaan and Mizraim (Egypt) among the sons of Ham (10:6). In the Psalms, Egypt is equated with Ham. The treatment of Japheth in verses 26–27 raises questions: Why is YHWH named as the God of Shem, but not of Japheth? What does it mean that God will \"enlarge\" Japheth? And why will Japheth \"dwell in the tents of Shem\"? Further difficulties include Ham's being referred to as \"the youngest son\", when all other lists make him Noah's second son. Per Sarna, the biggest challenge of the narrative is why Canaan was cursed, rather than Ham, and the concealed details of the shameful incident bear the same reticence of Reuben's sexual transgression.\n\nThe narrative's short five verses indicate that Canaan's Hamite paternity must have had great significance to the narrator or redactor, according to Sarna, who adds, \"The curse on Canaan, invoked in response to an act of moral depravity, is the first intimation of the theme of the corruption of the Canaanites, which is given as the justification for their being dispossessed of their land and for the transfer of that land to the descendants of Abraham.\"\n\nThe majority of commentators, both ancient and modern, have felt that Ham's seeing his father naked was not a sufficiently serious crime to explain the punishment that follows. Nevertheless, Genesis 9:23, in which Shem and Japheth cover Noah with a cloak while averting their eyes, suggests that the words are to be taken literally, and it has recently been pointed out that, in first millennium Babylonia, looking at another person's genitals was indeed regarded as a serious matter.\n\nOther ancient commentators suggested that Ham was guilty of more than what the Bible says. The \"Targum Onqelos\" has Ham gossiping about his father's drunken disgrace \"in the street\" (a reading which has a basis in the original Hebrew), so that being held up to public mockery was what had angered Noah; as the \"Cave of Treasures\" (fourth century) puts it, \"Ham laughed at his father's shame and did not cover it, but laughed about it and mocked.\"\n\nAncient commentaries have also debated whether \"seeing\" someone's nakedness meant to have sex with that person (e.g., Leviticus 20:17). The same idea was raised by third-century rabbis, in the \"Babylonian Talmud\" (c. 500 AD), who argue that Ham either castrated his father, or sodomised him. The same explanations are found in three Greek translations of the Bible, which replace the word \"see\" in verse 22 with another word denoting homosexual relations. The castration theory has its modern counterpart in suggested parallels found in the castration of Uranus by Cronus in Greek mythology and a Hittite myth of the supreme god Anu whose genitals were \"bitten off by his rebel son and cup-bearer Kumarbi, who afterwards rejoiced and laughed ... until Anu cursed him\".\n\nIn the Book of Jubilees, the seriousness of Ham's curse is compounded by the significance of God's covenant to \"never again bring a flood on the earth\". In response to this covenant, Noah builds a sacrificial altar \"to atone for the land\". Noah’s practice and ceremonial functions parallel the festival of Shavuot as if it were a prototype to the celebration of the giving of the Torah. His \"priestly\" functions also emulate being \"first priest\" in accordance with halakhah as taught in the Qumranic works. By turning the drinking of the wine into a religious ceremony, \"Jubilees\" alleviates any misgivings that may be provoked by the episode of Noah's drunkenness. Thus, Ham's offense would constitute an act of disrespect not only to his father, but also to the festival ordinances.\n\nThe medieval commentary of Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki 1040–1105), who cites older sources from Judaism's Oral Torah, which is relied upon by traditional Judaic scholarship as the most basic commentary to the present time, provides an introductory explanation. (:\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the curse was made by Noah, not by God. Some biblical scholars claim that when a curse is made by a man, it could only have been effective if God supports it, unlike the curse of Ham and his descendants, which was not confirmed by God or, at least, it is not mentioned in the Bible that he had confirmed it.\n\n4Q252, a \"pesher\" (interpretation) on the Book of Genesis found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, explains that since Ham had already been blessed by God (Genesis 9:1), he could not now be cursed by Noah. The 4Q252 scroll probably dates from the later half of the first century BC. A century later, the Jewish historian Josephus argued that Noah refrained from cursing Ham because of his nearness of kin, and so cursed Ham's son instead.\n\nA new alternative interpretation of 4Q181, which is a Dead Sea scroll of Genesis, parallels the Book of Jubilees, suggesting that Canaan was cursed because he defied Noah’s division of the land.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees also recounts the incident between Ham and Noah, and Noah's resulting curse against Canaan, in similar terms. Later, however, \"Jubilees\" explains further that Noah had allocated Canaan a land west of the Nile along with his brothers, but that he violated this agreement and instead chose to squat in the land delineated to Shem (and later Abraham), and so rightly deserved the curse of slavery.\n\nPhilo of Alexandria, a 1st-century BC Jewish philosopher, said that Ham and Canaan were equally guilty, if not of whatever had been done to Noah, then of other crimes, \"for the two of them together had acted foolishly and wrongly and committed other sins.\" Rabbi Eleazar decided that Canaan had in fact been the first to see Noah, and had then gone and told his father, who then told his brothers in the street; this, said Eleazar, \"did not take to mind the commandment to honour one's father.\" Another interpretation was that Noah's \"youngest son\" could not be Ham, who was the middle son: \"for this reason they say that this youngest son was in fact Canaan.\"\n\nIn the past, some people claimed that the \"curse of Ham\" was a biblical justification for imposing slavery or racism upon black people, although this concept is essentially an ideologically driven misconception. Regarding this matter, the Christian leader Martin Luther King Jr. called such an attempt \"a blasphemy\" that \"is against everything that the Christian religion stands for.\"\n\nFor Southern slave owners faced with the abolitionist movement to end slavery, the Curse of Ham was among the only grounds upon which Christian slave owners could formulate an ideological defense of slavery. Even before slavery, in order to promote economic motivations within Europe associated with colonialism, the Curse of Ham was used to shift the common Aristotelian belief that phenotypic differentiation among humans was a result of climatic difference, to a racialist perspective that phenotypic differentiation among the species was due to there being different racial types. This latter effort started in England.  Englishmen were widely afraid to further the colonial efforts of The Crown and begin a new life in lower latitude colonies for fear of becoming black. In 1578, George Best, a sea captain who was a member of the Elizabethan court, first popularized the myth of racial differences within what would be a widely read book on the search for a Northwest passage to Asia. Best uses careful ethnographic descriptions to portray the indigenous peoples of the North West as being sophisticated hunters and gatherers, not different in spirit than the white Englishmen, at the same time he presents a scathing account of Africans, saying of them that they are a \"black and loathsome\" people on account of being descendants of the “cursed chus\". Interestingly, Best doesn’t mention the curse as lying upon Ham, but rather Chus.  The fact is there is no indication in Genesis proper that can be used to justify racism and slavery, but the vagueness of Genesis 9-11 coupled with a damning curse from an important biblical patriarch was used as propaganda to influence popular belief by racist Christians who were trying to further particular agendas. The historian David Whiteford writes of a “curse matrix” which was derived from the vagueness of genesis 9 and interpreted to mean that it didn’t matter who was cursed or what group of people the curse originated with, all that mattered was that there was a vague reference to a generational curse that could be exploited any which way by agenda-driven racists like George Best.\n\nPro-slavery intellectuals were hard pressed to find any justification for slavery and racism within Christian theology which taught that all humans were descendants of Adam and therefore one race, possessed with equal salvation potential and deserving to be treated as kin. The Curse of Ham was used to drive a wedge in the mythology of a single human race, as elite intellectuals were able to convince people that the three sons of Noah represented the three sects of Man and their respective hierarchy of different fates. Leading intellectuals in the south, like Benjamin M. Palmer, claimed that White Europeans were descendent from Japhet who was prophesied by Noah to cultivate civilization and the powers of the intellect, while Africans, being descendants of the cursed Ham, were destined to be possessed by a slavish nature ruled by base appetites. The Curse of Ham, as construed by agenda driven, pro-slavery intellectuals like Palmer, gave a biblical depth to the justification of slavery that couldn't be found anywhere else within the Christian Framework. Palmer cited the Germanic philosophical position put forth by thinkers like Friedrich Von Schlegel, that there are different \"historic peoples,\" with different roles to play in the unfolding of history. These philosophies gave the common pro-slaver their only sense of profound justification for their behavior. As Palmer liked to preach, the southern slave owners were just continuing the pattern set forth by the great biblical patriarch Noah. Palmer taught that slave owners should appraise their own actions because they were planters of the land as was Noah, and the enslavement of the Africans was making good upon the great patriarch’s righteous curse. Pro-Slavers could make connections between the ancient rabbinical tradition that interpreted the mysterious wrong doings of Ham as being sexually deviant in nature with their own racialized, hyper-sexualized conception of Africans. Thus southern slave owners could convince themselves of a perverse natural order that set them at the top. The Curse of Ham itself gives no grounds for such gross misuse, and misinterpretation, as the majority of Christian Theologians have always argued, yet agenda-driven intellectuals found ways to exploit the vagueness and mystery of Genesis 9-11 to further their own ends.\n\nWhile Genesis 9 never says that Ham was black, he became associated with black skin, through folk etymology deriving his name from a similar, but actually unconnected, word meaning \"dark\" or \"brown\". The next stage are certain fables according to ancient Jewish traditions. According to one legend preserved in the Babylonian Talmud, God cursed Ham because he broke a prohibition on sex aboard the ark and \"was smitten in his skin\"; according to another, Noah cursed him because he castrated his father. Although the Talmud refers only to Ham, the version brought in a midrash goes on further to say \"Ham, that Cush came from him\" in reference to the blackness, that the curse did not apply to all of Ham but only to his eldest son Cush, Cush being a sub-Saharan African. Thus, two distinct traditions existed, one explaining dark skin as the result of a curse on Ham, the other explaining slavery by the separate curse on Canaan.\n\nThe concepts were introduced into Islam during the Arab expansion of the 7th century, due to cross-pollination of Jewish and Christian parables and theology into Islam, called \"Isra'iliyyat\". Some medieval Muslim writers—including Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Ibn Khaldun, and even the later \"Book of the Zanj\"—asserted the view that the effects of Noah's curse on Ham's descendants included blackness, slavery, and a requirement not to let the hair grow past the ears, despite the fact that this contradicted the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad regarding skin color and racial equality, most notably in his last sermon. This is also in spite of the fact that the account of the drunkenness of Noah and curse of Ham are not present within the text of the Qur'an, the Islamic holy book, and not consistent with Islamic teachings that Noah is a prophet, and prophets do not drink alcohol. Islam holds prophets of God in very high esteem, and some Muslims suggest the prophets are infallible.\n\nAn independent interpretation of the curse being imposed on all of the descendants of Ham persisted in Judaism, especially since the other children of Ham were situated in the African continent; i.e., Mizraim fathered the Egyptians, Cush the Cushites, and Phut the Libyans.\n\nIn medieval Christian exegesis, Ham's sin was regarded as laughter (for mocking his father and doing nothing to rectify his condition).\n\nElsewhere in Medieval Europe, the \"Curse of Ham\" also became used as a justification for serfdom. Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1100) was the first recorded to propose a caste system associating Ham with serfdom, writing that serfs were descended from Ham, nobles from Japheth, and free men from Shem. However, he also followed the interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:21 by Ambrosiaster (late 4th century), which held that as servants in the temporal world, these \"Hamites\" were likely to receive a far greater reward in the next world than would the Japhetic nobility.\n\nThe idea that serfs were the descendants of Ham soon became widely promoted in Europe. An example is Dame Juliana Berners (c. 1388), who, in a treatise on hawks, claimed that the \"churlish\" descendants of Ham had settled in Europe, those of the temperate Shem in Africa, and those of the noble Japheth in Asia (a departure from normal arrangements, which placed Shem in Asia, Japheth in Europe, and Ham in Africa), because she considered Europe to be the \"country of churls\", Asia of gentility, and Africa of temperance. As serfdom waned in the late medieval era, the interpretation of serfs being descendants of Ham decreased as well.\n\nHam also figured in an immensely influential work \"Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus\" (\"Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity\"). In 1498, Annius of Viterbo claimed to have translated records of Berossus, an ancient Babylonian priest and scholar; which are today usually considered an elaborate forgery. However, they gained great influence over Renaissance ways of thinking about population and migration, filling a historical gap following the biblical account of the flood. According to this account, Ham studied the evil arts that had been practiced before the flood, and thus became known as \"Cam Esenus\" (Ham the Licentious), as well as the original Zoroaster and Saturn (Cronus). He became jealous of Noah's additional children born after the deluge, and began to view his father with enmity, and one day, when Noah lay drunk and naked in his tent, Ham saw him and sang a mocking incantation that rendered Noah temporarily sterile, as if castrated. This account contains several other parallels connecting Ham with Greek myths of the castration of Uranus by Cronus, as well as Italian legends of Saturn and/or Camesis ruling over the Golden Age and fighting the Titanomachy. Ham in this version also abandoned his wife who had been aboard the ark and had mothered the African peoples, and instead married his sister Rhea, daughter of Noah, producing a race of giants in Sicily.\n\nThe explanation that black Africans, as the \"sons of Ham\", were cursed, possibly \"blackened\" by their sins, was advanced only sporadically during the Middle Ages, but it became increasingly common during the slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The justification of slavery itself through the sins of Ham was well suited to the ideological interests of the elite; with the emergence of the slave trade, its racialized version justified the exploitation of African labour.\n\nIn the parts of Africa where Christianity flourished in its early days, while it was still illegal in Rome, this idea never took hold, and its interpretation of scripture was never adopted by the African Coptic Churches. A modern Amharic commentary on Genesis notes the nineteenth century and earlier European theory that blacks were subject to whites as a result of the \"curse of Ham\", but calls this a false teaching unsupported by the text of the Bible, emphatically pointing out that Noah's curse did not fall upon all descendants of Ham, but only on the descendants of Canaan, and asserting that it was fulfilled when Canaan was occupied by both Semites (Israel) and Japhetites. The commentary further notes that Canaanites ceased to exist politically after the Third Punic War (149 BC), and their current descendants are thus unknown and scattered among all peoples.\n\nRobert Boyle—a seventeenth-century scientist who also was a theologian and a devout Christian—refuted the idea that blackness was caused by the Curse of Ham, in his book \"Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours\" (1664). There, Boyle explains that the Curse of Ham as an explanation for the complexion of coloured people was but a misinterpretation that was embraced by \"vulgar writers\", travelers, critics, and also \"men of note\" of his time. In his work, he challenges that vision, explaining:\n\nA number of other scholars also support the claim that the racialized version of the Curse of Ham was devised at that time because it suited ideological and economical interests of the European elite and slave traders who wanted to justify exploitation of African labour. While Robinson (2007) claims that such version was non-existent before, historian David Brion Davis argues, as well, that contrary to the claims of many reputable historians, neither the Talmud nor any early post-biblical Jewish writing relates blackness of the skin to a curse whatsoever.\n\nIn 1835, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, produced a work called the Book of Abraham. It explicitly denotes that an Egyptian king by the name of Pharaoh was a descendant of Ham and the Canaanites, who were black (), that Noah had cursed his lineage so they did not have the right to the priesthood, and that all Egyptians descended from him. It was later considered scripture by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This passage is the only one found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood, and, while nothing in the Book of Abraham explicitly denotes Noah's curse was the same curse mentioned in the Bible or that the Egyptians were related to other black Africans, it later became the foundation of church policy in regards to the priesthood ban. The 2002 \"Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual\" points to Abraham 1:21–27 as the reasoning behind not giving black people the priesthood until 1978.\n\nIn the following year, Smith taught that the Curse of Ham came from God, and that blacks were cursed with servitude. He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery that God could do his own work. Without reversing his opinion on the Curse of Ham, Smith started expressing more anti-slavery positions starting in 1842. After Smith's death, leaders of the LDS Church continued to teach that black Africans were under the curse of Ham and that those who tried to abolish slavery were going against the decrees of God, although the day would come when the curse would be nullified through the saving powers of Jesus Christ. In addition, based on his interpretation of the Book of Abraham, Brigham Young believed that, as a result of this curse, negroes were banned from the Mormon priesthood.\n\nIn 1978, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball said he received a revelation that extended the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church without regard to race or color. In 2013, The LDS church denounced the curse of Ham explanation for withholding the priesthood from black Africans. However, the essays have not been well publicized, and many members remain unaware of the essays and hold to racist beliefs that had been taught in the past. The Book of Abraham is still considered scripture in the LDS church. The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS Institutes, teaches that Canaan could not hold the priesthood because of his ancestral lineage but mentions nothing of race or skin color:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2534867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2534867", "title": "Video quality", "text": "Video quality\n\nVideo quality is a characteristic of a video passed through a video transmission/processing system, a formal or informal measure of perceived video degradation (typically, compared to the original video). Video processing systems may introduce some amount of distortion or artifacts in the video signal, which negatively impacts the user's perception of a system. For many stakeholders such as content providers, service providers, and network operators, the assurance of video quality is an important task.\n\nVideo quality evaluation is performed to describe the quality of a set of video sequences under study. Video quality can be evaluated objectively (by mathematical models) or subjectively (by asking users for their rating). Also, the quality of a system can be determined offline (i.e., in a laboratory setting for developing new codecs or services), or in-service (to monitor and ensure a certain level of quality).\n\nSince the world's first video sequence was recorded and transmitted, many video processing systems have been designed. Such systems encode video streams and transmit them over various kinds of networks or channels. In the ages of analog video systems, it was possible to evaluate the quality aspects of a video processing system by calculating the system's frequency response using test signals (for example, a collection of color bars and circles).\n\nDigital video systems have almost fully replaced analog ones, and quality evaluation methods have changed. The performance of a digital video processing and transmission system can vary significantly and depends, amongst others, on the characteristics of the input video signal (e.g. amount of motion or spatial details), the settings used for encoding and transmission, and the channel fidelity or network performance.\n\nObjective video quality models are mathematical models that approximate results from subjective quality assessment, in which human observers are asked to rate the quality of a video. In this context, the term \"model\" may refer to a simple statistical model in which several independent variables (e.g. the packet loss rate on a network and the video coding parameters) are fit against results obtained in a subjective quality evaluation test using regression techniques. A model may also be a more complicated algorithm implemented in software or hardware.\n\nThe terms \"model\" and \"metric\" are often used interchangeably in the field. However a metric has certain mathematical properties, which, by strict definition, do not apply to all video quality models.\n\nThe term “objective” relates to the fact that, in general, quality models are based on criteria that can be \"measured\" objectively – that is, free from human interpretation. They can be automatically evaluated by a computer program. Unlike a panel of human observers, an objective model should always deterministically output the same quality score for a given set of input parameters.\n\nObjective quality models are sometimes also referred to as \"instrumental (quality) models\", in order to emphasize their application as measurement instruments. Some authors suggest that the term “objective” is misleading, as it “implies that instrumental measurements bear objectivity, which they only do in case that they can be generalized.”\n\nObjective models can be classified by the amount of information available about the original signal, the received signal, or whether there is a signal present at all: \n\nSome models that are used for video quality assessment (such as PSNR or SSIM) are simply image quality models, whose output is calculated for every frame of a video sequence. This quality measure of every frame can then be recorded and pooled over time to assess the quality of an entire video sequence. While this method is easy to implement, it does not factor in certain kinds of degradations that develop over time, such as the moving artifacts caused by packet loss and its concealment. A video quality model that considers the temporal aspects of quality degradations, like VQM or the MOVIE Index, may be able to produce more accurate predictions of human-perceived quality.\n\nAn overview of recent no-reference image quality models has been given in a journal paper by Shahid et al. As mentioned above, these can be used for video applications as well. No-reference, pixel-based quality models designed specifically for video are however rare, with Video-BLIINDS being one example. The Video Quality Experts Group has a dedicated working group on developing no-reference metrics (called NORM).\n\nThe most traditional ways of evaluating quality of digital video processing system (e.g. a video codec) are FR-based. Among the oldest FR metrics are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are calculated between every frame of the original and the degraded video signal. PSNR is the most widely used objective image quality metric, and the average PSNR over all frames can be considered a video quality metric. PSNR is also used often during video codec development in order to optimize encoders. However, PSNR values do not correlate well with perceived picture quality due to the complex, highly non-linear behavior of the human visual system.\n\nWith the success of digital video, a large number of more precise FR metrics have been developed. These metrics are inherently more complex than PSNR, and need more computational effort to calculate predictions of video quality. Among those metrics specifically developed for video are VQM and the MOVIE Index.\n\nBased on the results of benchmarks by the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) (some in the course of the Multimedia Test Phase (2007–2008) and the HDTV Test Phase I (2009–2011)), some RR/FR metrics have been standardized in ITU-T as:\nThe popular Structural Similarity (SSIM) image quality metric is also often used for estimating video quality, which has led to a Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards in 2015. Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) – also an image quality metric – is a core element of the Netflix Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF), a tool that combines existing metrics to predict video quality. The Structural Similarity PLUS (SSIMPLUS) index is an evolution of Structural Similarity (SSIM) with extra capabilities of handling cross-resolution/-framerate/-bitdepth and HDR/WCG video quality assessment.\n\nFull or reduced-reference metrics still require access to the original video bitstream before transmission, or at least part of it. In practice, an original stream may not always be available for comparison, for example when measuring the quality from the user side. In other situations, a network operator may want to measure the quality of video streams passing through their network, without fully decoding them. For a more efficient estimation of video quality in such cases, parametric/bitstream-based metrics have also been standardized:\n\nFew of these standards have found successful commercial application, including PEVQ and VQuad-HD. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) model, the Emmy-winning SSIM tool, the MOVIE Index and the older Tektronix PQA models are used by broadcast and post-production houses throughout the television and cinematic industries. VMAF is used by Netflix to tune their encoding and streaming algorithms, and to quality-control all streamed content. The SSIMPLUS index has been commercialized by SSIMWAVE Inc. and used by video distributors for live and file-based video quality monitoring in large-scale networks like here.\n\nSince objective video quality models are expected to predict results given by human observers, they are developed with the aid of subjective test results. During development of an objective model, its parameters should be trained so as to achieve the best correlation between the objectively predicted values and the subjective scores, often available as mean opinion scores (MOS).\n\nThe most widely used subjective test materials are in the public-domain and include still picture, motion picture, streaming video, high definition, 3-D (stereoscopic) and special-purposes picture quality related datasets. These so-called databases are created by various research laboratories around the world. Some of them have become de facto standards, including several public-domain subjective picture quality databases created and maintained by the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) as well the Tampere Image Database 2008. A collection of databases can be found in the QUALINET Databases repository. The Consumer Digital Video Library (CDVL) hosts freely available video test sequences for model development.\n\nIn theory, a model can be trained on a set of data in such a way that it produces perfectly matching scores on that dataset. However, such a model will be over-trained and will therefore not perform well on new datasets. It is therefore advised to validate models against new data and use the resulting performance as a real indicator of the model's prediction accuracy.\n\nTo measure the performance of a model, some frequently used metrics are the linear correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE). Other metrics are the kappa coefficient and the outliers ratio. ITU-T Rec. P.1401 gives an overview of statistical procedures to evaluate and compare objective models.\n\nObjective video quality models can be used in various application areas. In video codec development, the performance of a codec is often evaluated in terms of PSNR or SSIM. For service providers, objective models can be used for monitoring a system. For example, an IPTV provider may choose to monitor their service quality by means of objective models, rather than asking users for their opinion, or waiting for customer complaints about bad video quality.\n\nAn objective model should only be used in the context that it was developed for. For example, a model that was developed using a particular video codec is not guaranteed to be accurate for another video codec. Similarly, a model trained on tests performed on a large TV screen should not be used for evaluating the quality of a video watched on a mobile phone.\n\nWhen estimating quality of a video codec, all the mentioned objective methods may require repeating post-encoding tests in order to determine the encoding parameters that satisfy a required level of visual quality, making them time consuming, complex and impractical for implementation in real commercial applications. There is ongoing research into developing novel objective evaluation methods which enable prediction of the perceived quality level of the encoded video before the actual encoding is performed.\n\nThe main goal of many objective video quality metrics is to automatically estimate the average user's (viewer's) opinion on the quality of a video processed by a system. Procedures for subjective video quality measurements are described in ITU-R recommendation BT.500 and ITU-T recommendation P.910. In such tests, video sequences are shown to a group of viewers. The viewers' opinion is recorded and averaged into the Mean Opinion Score to evaluate the quality of each video sequence. However, the testing procedure may vary depending on what kind of system is tested.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest extant work to mention the word \"dhokla\" is the Gujarati \"Varanaka Samuchaya\" (1520 CE).\n\nRice and split chickpeas (chana dal), in a particular ratio (to achieve the desired texture and taste) are soaked overnight. The mixture is ground, and the paste is fermented for four to five hours or overnight. This is spiced by adding chili pepper, Coriander, ginger and baking soda.\n\nThe fermented batter is then steamed for about 15 minutes on a flat dish and cut into pieces. These chopped pieces are seasoned in hot oil with mustard seeds. Asafoetida and chopped green chillies can also be fried and, sometimes, an equal amount of water and a little sugar is added to this oil. The pieces are then removed from dish. Sometimes it is also fried in hot oil with cumin seeds.\n\nIt is usually served with deep fried chillies and chutney made from coriander. It is garnished with coriander and often with grated coconut.\n\nAnother method is to steam the fermented batter for 15 minutes on plates placed inside a container that does not allow steam to escape. To avoid steam water falling on the batter during preparation, a cloth may be placed inside the container. The plates are not directly placed on the base, or the batter will burn, so a small stand is used. When the batter is steamed properly, the plates are taken out of the container and then served with raw oil poured over the dhokla, or used as dip. Other ingredients like curd, tomato sauce, garlic paste, or coriander paste may be used in serving, however none of these are traditionally eaten with dhokla.\n\nThere are different kinds of dhokla prepared with different ingredients and ratios of chickpeas. Some of the popular kinds of dhoklas are:\nKhaman is a similar gram flour-based food. Whereas dhokla is made with rice and chickpeas, khaman is made from chickpeas only. It is generally lighter in color and softer than dhokla. To make dhokla, a small proportion of baking soda is added while to make khaman more baking soda is added to make it more fluffy, spongy and porous.\n\nIdada is another variety of dhokla, which is made by using different lentils like black grams, also known as urad dal, instead of chickpeas. Dhokla is very commonly used as a breakfast or as a snack in western parts of India including Madhya Pradesh, though nowadays it's available in every Indian state. It is an easy to cook and easy to digest snack.\n\nBeetroot Dhokla is a simple variation of the popular Gujarati Dhoklas. It is a new snack.\n\n"}

The eggs, and sometimes extra yolks, are beaten with sugar and heated at the same time, using a bain-marie or flame, to a stage known to patissiers as \"ribbon stage\". A genoise is generally a fairly lean cake, getting most of its fat from egg yolks, but some recipes also add in melted butter before baking.\n\nGenoise is a basic building block of much French pâtisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise:\nWhen finished baking, the sheet is rolled while still warm (to make jelly rolls or bûches de Noël), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold to be filled with a frozen dessert. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream. The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes.\nThe cake is notable for its elastic and somewhat dry texture and is sometimes soaked with flavored syrups or liqueurs and often served with a buttercream frosting. The popular tiramisu cake may be made with ladyfingers or a genoise sheet.\n\nA chocolate genoise can be made by substituting cocoa powder for some of the flour, and is sometimes used as a substitute for the richer cake used in the standard Sacher torte recipe.\n\n\n"}

Being derived from shawarma, it is also similar to the Turkish döner kebab and the Greek gyros. In contrast to döner kebab and shawarma however, tacos al pastor are pork based. In some places of northern Mexico, as in Baja California, this taco is called taco de adobada. A similar dish from Puebla with different spices is tacos árabes.\n\nA wave of mainly Christian Lebanese immigration to Mexico took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1960s, Mexican-born progeny of Lebanese immigrants began opening their own restaurants and combining their heritage with Mexican cuisine.\nGrilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks was developed in the 19th century in Ottoman Turkey. This is döner kebab, which is the origin of tacos al pastor, Middle Eastern shawarma, and Greek gyros.\n\nPork is marinated in a combination of dried chilies, spices and pineapple. In some places, achiote is also added, and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a \"trompo\" (lit: spinning top), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top. When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife. It is served on small tortillas, with finely chopped onions, cilantro, and occasionally a small slice of pineapple, and usually topped with some lemon or lime juice and hot salsa. This meat is a common ingredient in not just tacos, but also gringas, alambres, huaraches, tortas, burritos and pizza.\n\nIn some places of northern Mexico, such as Nuevo León, Durango and Chihuahua, these are usually called \"tacos de trompo\" if served on corn tortillas, and \"gringas\" if they are served with cheese on wheat tortillas.\n\nA similar dish is called \"tacos árabes\", which originated in Puebla in the 1930s from Arab Mexican cuisine. Tacos árabes use shawarma-style meat carved from a spit, but are served in a pita-style bread called \"pan árabe\". These tacos have been brought by Mexican immigrants to the United States in the past few years and have become popular in cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, two of the largest Mexican/Mexican-American population centers in the United States.\n\nA non-pork version featuring chicken marinated in the \"al pastor\" style was brought \"back\" to the Middle East in the early 2000s, and sold as \"shawarma mexici\". It is essentially a chicken shawarma made in the Middle Eastern style (wrapped with garlic mayonnaise, dill pickle, and french fries in a thin flatbread).\n\n"}

It is used in the Indian subcontinent for all sizes of gatherings and can be religious, commercial, cultural or sport-related. In rural traditions melas or village fairs were (and in some cases still are) of great importance. This led to their export around the world by south Asian diaspora communities wishing to bring something of that tradition to their new countries. \n\nIn recent times \"Mela\" also popularly refers to shows and exhibitions. It can be theme-based, promoting a particular culture, art or skill. Generally in \"melas\" people can find eateries, entertainment activities, shops and games. \n\nThe Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years, at Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain is one of the largest fairs in India, where over 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the largest gathering anywhere in the world.\n\n\nIn modern usage outside South Asia it has become a term that shows widespread diversity of interpretation, just as has been the case in South Asia. One can find a Nepalese mela in the USA, or a Bengali mela in London, such as the Baishakhi Mela. For many it is a wider intercultural (though mainly Asian) festival incorporating music, dance, food and other aspects of mainstream culture.\n\nSince the 1980s an increasing number of melas have regularly been held in larger towns outside south Asia, especially in the UK and North America. The larger melas tend to be those with larger ethnic minority populations, but many melas are held in communities with small South Asian diasporas. Community ownership of these melas is important to the south Asian communities who see them as opportunities to share their cultural heritage with the mainstream. They are opportunities for bridge building and community building and can perform a strong socially cohesive function.\n\nMore successful outside-of-Asia melas tend to have a strongly diversified funding base with private/public/third sector collaboration. Public money is often spent on the melas. This reflects the mela organisers and public authorities joint conviction that, as in the sub-continent, melas are for everyone.\n\n\n"}

When thrown against a hard surface, bouncy balls retain their momentum and much of their kinetic energy (or, if dropped, convert much of their potential energy to kinetic energy). They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force.\n\nSolid rubber balls such as the Spaldeen (a corruption of Spalding, the manufacturer), about the size of a tennis ball and often colored pink, have been manufactured since the 1930s and remain so into the 21st century. They were fundamental to the development of American street games such as stickball, in addition to other uses in play.

They were first sold by the Wham-O toy company under the name Super Ball, which remains their trademark. Superballs are often smaller than a Spaldeen.\n\nSkyball is a brand of hollow medium-sized bouncy ball filled with a mix of helium and compressed air, claimed by the manufacturer to have particularly good bounce characteristics. Nerf balls, introduced in 1970, are also small balls that bounce, but they have a lower coefficient of restitution than a typical bouncy ball. Balls similar in size and composition to Spaldeens, but featuring a plethora of designs (such as a baseball pattern, miniature basketball and soccer ball patterns, and so forth) are offered by many companies. Due to their low cost per unit, bouncy balls with logos or other designs are sometimes used as promotional merchandise. Bouncy balls may, by means of fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or motion-activated LEDs, emit light; such balls are called glow balls.

There are different theories on how the candy got its name which have over time come to light. The name could have come from the comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), however by the 1940s the comic strip had ended. Another theory for the name involves the Matina Brothers, two of whom were nicknamed \"Mike\" & \"Ike\". Author \"Dean Jensen\" writes that the younger twin brothers became very popular in America to an extent that a boxed candy was named after them. The brothers were billed as circus midgets and had a role in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" as munchkins. Other theories include a company-wide contest, a vaudeville song titled “Mike and Ike”, and the Eisenhower era which was nicknamed (\"IKE\"). Just Born acquired the \"Rodda Candy Company\" in 1953 which allowed it to produce new flavors of the candy that included cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, since then different varieties have been introduced on and off.\n\nMike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry.

Latin \"focus\" meaning \"fireplace\"). However, the modern \"lángos,\" despite its name, is not prepared near an open flame but rather by deep-fat frying, and among Hungarian foods it is instead the \"pogácsa\" which preserves the connection, both etymological and culinary, to the ancient \"panis focacius.\"\n\n\"Lalanga\" was present both in the Byzantine and Ottoman cuisines; while in the first one it was only eaten as a sweet, in Ottoman Turkey it was eaten both as a sweet (with honey) or as a savoury dish with cheese. Lalanga continues to exist in the Turkish cuisine, as well as in the Greek Cuisine (mostly in Peloponnese) as Lalagia (In Greek \"Λαλάγγια\").\n\nThe dough for lángos is made of water or milk and flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Adding sour cream, yoghurt or mashed potatoes to the dough is optional, in the latter case it is called potato lángos (in Hungarian \"krumplis lángos\"). It is eaten fresh and warm, topped with sour cream and grated cheese, or Liptauer, ham, or sausages, or most frequently, without toppings, just rubbed with garlic or garlic butter, or doused with garlic water. Other ingredients and accompaniments can be mushroom, quark cheese, eggplant, cabbage, kefir, omelet, and a confectioner's sugar or jam.\n\nTraditionally lángos was baked in the front of the brick oven close to the flames. This is the basis for its name; \"láng\" means \"flame\" in the Hungarian language. Lángos was made from bread dough and was served as breakfast on the days when new bread was baked. Now that people no longer have brick ovens and do not bake bread at home, lángos is virtually always fried in oil.\n\nLángos is popular all year long. As it is a rather affordable and simple food, it is often sold around bus stations, fairs, and all over Eastern European countries during local celebrations or sport events. It is sold at many fast-food restaurants not only in Hungary but also in Austria. In Austria, especially in Vienna, lángos is very popular as a fast food at fairs and in amusement parks like the Prater. Lángos is known in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia as \"langoš\", in Serbia as \"languš\" (although it is commonly called \"Mekike\"). In Slovenia is known as Langaš. In Bulgaria it is known as \"Mekitsi\". It is also popular in Romania (especially in Transylvania) as \"langoși\". It is also extremely popular in Poland where it is known as \"langosz\" and in the UK where it's called \"langos\" or \"Hungarian Fried Bread.\"\n\nLángos is very similar to a version of frybread made by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Danone and Wahaha's General Manager Zong Qinghou signed a deal in December 2006, allowing Danone to buy a majority stake in the non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claiming the offer was underpriced. It is alleged that he wanted to squeeze a higher price out of Danone.\n\nIn a trademark dispute, Danone filed for arbitration in Stockholm on 9 May 2007. Danone took further legal action by filing a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Ever Maple Trading and Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd on 4 June 2007, companies controlled by Zong's wife and daughter.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, Danone and the Chinese partner agreed to suspend their legal battle and resume negotiations.\n\nFounded in 1987, Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. Limited was originally a sales company owned by the government of Hangzhou's Shangcheng District. From its creation, Zong Qinghou has led and grown the business, exercising control over the day-to-day operations. In 1995, Peregrine Investments Holdings introduced Zong to Danone, and discussions about joint ventures began. A joint venture agreement was signed on 28 March 1996. Major parts of the drinks business were injected into the joint venture, and Zong became its chairman whilst remaining the managing director of the holding and operating companies. In the melée of the company's transformation from a state-owned enterprise to a private company, Zong became an important minority shareholder.\n\nThe foreign partners took 51%, while the Chinese partners held 49% (of which WHH holds 39% and employees own 10%).\n\nGroupe Danone and Peregrine together invested US$70 million in return for the stake in five joint venture WHH companies. The holding was held through a Singapore registered entity called Jinjia Investments Co (金加投资公司), the board of which consisted of two Danone representatives, and Francis Leung Pak-to () from Peregrine.\n\nIn April 1998, just before the news of Peregrine's collapse broke, Leung was replaced on the board by a third representative from Danone. Although a transfer of shares in the WHH companies would have required State approval under the rules in force at the time for protecting state assets, the shares in Jinjia were not covered. When Peregrine collapsed, and transferred its Jinjia shares, Groupe Danone became majority owner. Zong has alleged that this transfer of ownership was a bad-faith takeover by stealth.\n\nOn 28 March 1996, five joint venture companies were formed:\n\nThe business had grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007, and the total injected capital amounts to US$131 million.\n\nIn 2006, the turnover of the joint ventures contributed €100 million to the top line of Danone, and in excess of 5% of Danone's total net profit.\n\nWhen the joint venture agreement was inked, five other WHH companies remained outside the scope of the joint venture.\n\nAt the end of 2006, total non-joint venture companies reportedly had equity of ¥5.6 billion and profits of ¥1.04 billion. In December, Zong had agreed to sell these to Danone for ¥4 billion.\n\nThe Hangzhou Wahaha Guangsheng Investment Co. (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资有限公司) (\"GUANGSHENG\") established in 2003 with registered capital of ¥50 million, is a key non-JV entity. Its shares were held by Zong and the union in a ratio of 60:40. Its capital was later increased to ¥80 million. The following companies were its subsidiaries or associates, with holdings ranging from 39 to 60 percent :\n\nThe shares of Hangzhou Wahaha Children's Clothing Co. (杭州娃哈哈童装有限公司) founded in 2002, were initially held by Guangsheng, but were transferred out in August 2003, in an \"interesting series of share transfers\". It is now 65% owned by Zong, 10% by his wife, and 25% by Platinum Net Ltd.\n\nThe Hangzhou Wahaha Food and Beverage Sales Co. (杭州娃哈哈食品饮料营销有限公司) \"WHHFBSC\", registered on 19 December 2006, is an external company allegedly now the centre of a parallel distribution network. 10% of its share capital is held by Zong's wife, Shi Youzhen, and 90% by Zong's personal vehicle Ever Maple Trading Ltd., registered in the British Virgin Islands. Its legal representative is Zong's daughter Zong Fuli.\n\nZong set up non-jv owned factories, such as the Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. (杭州萧山顺发食品包装公司), to manufacture or pack products identical to WHH. Danone further alleges that dealers were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories.\n\nThe Wahaha trademark was assigned to the main joint venture vehicle on 29 February 1996, and a joint venture agreement was eventually signed on 28 March 1996. Danone insist that the joint venture agreement with valid and exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand, for which Danone paid Hangzhou Wahaha Group the sum of RMB 100 million, including 50 million from the joint venture vehicle. Local government approval was obtained. However, WHH maintains that rules in force stipulate that trademark transfer agreements must be approved by the National Trademark Bureau, while local government powers are limited to a veto. The transfer was denied by the National Trademark Bureau according for the rule safeguarding national assets. Although the regulations over the transfer of trademarks was apparently lifted in October 2001, the parties signed an additional contract in October 2005 covering the use of the trademark covering company names and products.\n\nDanone agreed to terms of joint venture which didn’t give it much involvement, allowing the day-to-day running of the company rested in the hands of Zong, while he continued in his autocratic ways. Zong has even boasted about the managers sent by Danone whom he had sent packing.\n\nDanone gave Mr. Zong room to move since \"he operates in a very entrepreneurial way, making a lot of decisions on his own.\" Up until just before the conflict became public, Zong was allowed to pursue his own commercial strategy through external ventures where Danone had no wish to be. However, Danone felt that it was time to claw back a stake in the external ventures.\n\nDanone had made several attempts to buy out Zong, but was rebuffed. Danone and Zong signed a deal in December 2006, allowing Danone to buy out the non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claims he could not carry his co-investors, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\". Zong claims the offer was rejected as it was underpriced, and wanted to squeeze more out of Danone.\n\nOn 3 April 2007, the war of words started with an article on Xinhua's website entitled \"Wahaha victim of low-ball buyout by Danone\" which stated that the board had rejected Danone's attempt at a \"hostile takeover\" of Wahaha for ¥4 billion. The article was written by a Xinhua journalist to whom Zong had given an \"internal reference\" document in the hopes of influencing political leaders on the fate of Wahaha.\n\nOn 10 April, Danone issued a statement implying that Zong was in breach of his agreement with Danone by having entered into joint ventures with other partners with rights to use the brand. Zong had been accused of selling identical products using the \"Wahaha\" brand outside of the joint ventures, and Danone demanded a 51% stake in these. Danone sent a warning letter to Zong, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Wahaha joint ventures, giving 30 days for WHH to stop illegally selling products under \"Wahaha\" trademark without proper authorization.\n\nZong said that Emmanuel Faber had personally authorised the setting up of the units outside the scope of the joint ventures. Danone concedes that in around 2003, it allowed Zong to become a minority partner in businesses that made \"Wahaha\" products outside their joint-venture structure, apparently because local governments often preferred to have Zong personally as a partner. By 2005, Danone realized Zong controlled as many as 20 external businesses making drinks, and claims these represented approximately 25% of Wahaha products. Danone estimates that Zong had established in excess of 80 unauthorised companies using the WHH brandname between 2001 and 2006.\n\nZong set up externally owned factories to produce products identical to WHH, and Danone alleges that dealers were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories.\n\nDanone, which had apparently been relying on the WHH distribution network to sell \"Danone\" brand products, also found itself being the victim of mis-channelling. Since the dispute has erupted, distributors and employees have come out in support of Zong, calling for a boycott of Danone products.\n\nWhile Danone has been seeking justice against HWG and Chairman Zong in the international arena, Wahaha has embroiled Danone in multiple attacks at a local subsidiary-level. Political leaders from both countries have called for an amicable solution to the dispute.\n\nDanone filed for arbitration in Stockholm on 9 May. On 4 June, Danone filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Ever Maple Trading and Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd, as well as Zong's wife and daughter who run the two companies.\nEver Maple Trading Ltd is the controlling shareholder of Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage, which is the parent company of Hangzhou Wahaha Food and Beverage Sales for damages of US$100 million. Zong resigned as Chairman of the joint ventures on 5 June 2007.\n\nHowever, WHH challenges whether the joint-ventures have title to the WHH brand. Application for arbitration of the dispute with Danone over the trademark had been made to the Hangzhou Arbitration Committee, and was accepted on 17 June.\n\nIn August 2007, Hangzhou Wahaha Foods Co, the leading joint venture company, sued the State Trademark Bureau over what it claims was \"improper administrative behavior\" in 1996 and 1997. However, the case was withdrawn because it fell outside the statute of limitations.\n\nDanone filed claims against 10 companies believed linked to Wahaha in Samoa and the British Virgin Islands. The High Court of the British Virgin Islands placed eight companies registered there into receivership and froze their assets on 9 November. It was reported on 22 November that the assets of two Samoan registered entities were frozen and put into receivership under the order of the Supreme Court of Samoa; Danone won arbitration in Stockholm.\n\nOn 10 November, the Hangzhou Arbitration Committee ruled on the technicality that Danone had failed to appeal against its decision not to approve the transfer within the allotted time. The Wahaha labor union, citing fears of some 300 job-losses, also joined the legal fight against Danone. The union accused Danone of holding shares in companies that compete against the two big companies' 39 joint ventures.\n\nOn 21 December, under political pressure from the respective governments, Danone and the Chinese partner agreed to suspend their legal battle and resume negotiations.\n\nWhilst the surrender of 51% to two foreign partners may have appeared not to interfere with control of the company, Zong resented the takeover of Wahaha by stealth. This is manifested in Zong's nationalistic defense against Danone. Zong occasionally used expressions like \"unequal treaties\", which are a throwback to the colonial era. However, the Chinese press points out that Zong employs offshore tax havens, and that his daughter is a resident in the United States.\n\nThe restrictions contained in contracts and regulations considerably cramped the entrepreneurial style of Zong, who complained of limits the control structure placed on him. \"Most of the decisions had to be approved by Danone board members at board meetings once every quarter. How you want me to run the business under such conditions?\" The greater maturity in the company has made Zong feel he needs his foreign partner less.\n\nThe differing marketing choices of the groups contributed to the conflict. Zong is resentful that Danone was happy just to sit back and collect money, and wanted to stop him from investing: \"Whenever we wanted to expand the business, they said no. They refused to invest more. But they let us spend the money and then when the ventures made money they wanted in,\" he says.\n\nOutside the joint venture structure were \"a batch of companies which served the old impoverished areas of the west, and in the Three Gorges area. Danone had no desire to be there, but they turned out profitable\".\n\n\"Future Cola\" was another example: Zong decided to proceed with the launch of a cola in 1998, against the express wishes of Danone. It was tolerated because Qin Peng defended the contribution it made to the joint venture's profits.\n\nZong now controls a significant number of companies which make and sell products competing with the joint venture in its markets. Amongst others, Zong controls Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. which makes WHH branded products, and WHHFBSC, which is a parallel distribution company.\n\nInterpreting a clause in the JV agreement that the foreign partner must endeavour not to act in detriment to the interests of the JV, Zong is upset that Danone acquired sizeable stakes in many of its competitors, namely China Huiyuan Juice Group, Shenzhen Health Food, Bright Dairy & Food., and a 49% joint venture with Mengniu.\n\nWHH principally objects to Danone's role as owner since 2001 of its largest competitor, Guangdong Robust Group (乐百氏(广东)饮用水有限公司), which is a 92% owned subsidiary, and Shanghai Aquarius Drinking Water Ltd (上海正广和饮用水有限责任公司), in which it holds 50%. Zong protested to Danone in the year following Danone's acquisition of Robust, when Wahaha allegedly lost 80 million yuan (US$10.5 million).\n\nIn July 2007, Shenyang Industrial Development Co. (沈阳陵东实业发展总公司), who holds a 5% stake in Shenyang Wahaha Drinks Co, filed in the local courts against Danone nominated director since 1996, Qin Peng (秦鹏), for being a Director of some twenty competing entities without board approval.\n\nA Commerce Department official who was asked for comment said he believed the dispute was not inherently commercial nor contractual, but was more to do with \"fault\".\n\nAn article published in \"Caijing\" in May 2007 hinted that there may have been impropriety: Profits were siphoned off into factories and other external ventures in breach of the joint venture agreement; shareholdings were shuffled around to the detriment of other shareholders.\n\nAlthough Danone may have offered to buy out the external ventures for the quoted ¥4 billion, this payment was considered an olive-branch to end the irregularities. In failing to obtain a follow-through, and in the light of a media assault by Zong, Danone had run out of options for an amicable solution to the dispute.\n\nThe dispute took on a personal dimension when Danone filed in Los Angeles against his wife and 25-year-old daughter, who represented interests which owned the external ventures. Zong accused Danone of trying to destroy his family.\n\nIn 2009, Danone Group exited the joint venture by selling their 51% stake in Wahaha Group to Wahaha Group for an estimated $500 million.\n\n\n\n"}

They are then grilled or even lightly fried until the cheese melts and the tortillas become crispy, cut into halves or wedges and served, usually with salsa and pico de gallo, avocado or guacamole on top and/or other toppings or condiments.\n\nIn some American Tex-Mex eateries, such as Taco Bell, some quesadillas and/or sincronizadas may include chicken fajita meat. Fajita meat is not traditionally used in Mexico, as fajitas are a Tex-Mex dish, and not a Mexican one. In fact, the name \"fajitas\" is virtually unknown in Southern Mexico as a dish, although there are somewhat similar alambre dishes enjoyed throughout Mexico.\n\nThey are frequently confused with plain quesadillas, due to their resemblance to \"quesadillas\" sold in Mexico and the United States. (U.S. quesadillas are usually made with flour tortillas rather than molded from masa in the Mexican style). Note however that despite the fact that it looks almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a separate dish. The main difference between the real quesadilla and the sincronizadas is the obligatory inclusion of ham in the dish and the main ingredient used to make the tortilla (wheat flour instead of corn flour, masa harina). A quesadilla is made of a single folded and filled corn tortilla, while the sincronizada is prepared like a sandwich.\n\nIngredients could vary between Oaxaca cheese, Manchego cheese and different types of ham. The sincronizada is sometimes consumed alone, but in most regions of Mexico it is common to add a regional sour cream, salsa or guacamole as topping to make a richer flavor. The Tex-Mex version also contains beans, cheese, beef fajita meat and avocado and Monterey Jack cheese instead of the traditional Oaxacan one.\n\nSincronizadas are commonly consumed in the evening, as a component of a light Merienda. Despite being labeled fast food, they are eaten by many who wish to enjoy a small meal.\n\n"}

{"id": "2568868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2568868", "title": "Spaghetti alla puttanesca", "text": "Spaghetti alla puttanesca\n\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca (; \"spaghetti in the style of a prostitute\" in Italian) is an Italian pasta dish invented in Naples in the mid-20th century. Its ingredients typically include tomatoes, olive oil, anchovies, olives, capers and garlic.\n\nVarious accounts exist as to when and how the dish originated, but it probably dates to the mid-twentieth century. The earliest known mention of it is in Raffaele La Capria’s \"Ferito a Morte\" (\"Mortal Wound\"), a 1961 Italian novel which mentions \"\"spaghetti alla puttanesca come li fanno a Siracusa\" (spaghetti alla puttanesca as they make it in Syracuse)\". The sauce became popular in the 1960s, according to the Professional Union of Italian Pasta Makers.\n\nThe 1971 edition of the \"Cucchiaio d’argento\" (\"The Silver Spoon\"), one of Italy's most prominent cookbooks, has no recipe with this name, but two which are similar: The Neapolitan \"spaghetti alla partenopea\", is made with anchovies and generous quantities of oregano; while \"spaghetti alla siciliana\" is distinguished by the addition of green peppers. Still again there is a Sicilian style popular around Palermo that includes olives, anchovies and raisins.\n\nIn a 2005 article from \"Il Golfo\"—a daily newspaper serving the Italian islands of Ischia and Procida—Annarita Cuomo asserted that \"sugo alla puttanesca\" was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of \"Rancio Fellone\", a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot. According to Cuomo, Petti's moment of inspiration came when—near closing one evening—Petti found a group of customers sitting at one of his tables. He was low on ingredients and so told them he didn't have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry. \"\"Facci una puttanata qualsiasi\",\" or \"throw together whatever,\" they insisted. Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some capers—the basic ingredients for the \"sugo\", “So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,” Petti told Cuomo. Later, Petti included this dish on his menu as \"spaghetti alla puttanesca\".\n\nThe sauce alone is called \"sugo alla puttanesca\" in Italian. Recipes may differ according to preferences; for instance, the Neapolitan version is prepared without anchovies, unlike the version popular in Lazio. Spices are sometimes added. In most cases, however, the \"sugo\" is a little salty (from the capers, olives, and anchovies) and quite fragrant (from the garlic). Traditionally, the sauce is served with spaghetti, although it is also paired with penne, bucatini, linguine and vermicelli.\n\nGarlic and anchovies (omitted in the Neapolitan version) are sautéed in olive oil. Chopped chili peppers, olives, capers, diced tomatoes and oregano are added along with salt and black pepper to taste. The cook then reduces this mixture by simmering and pours it over spaghetti cooked al dente. The final touch is a topping of parsley.\n\nThe dish is featured in \"The Bad Beginning\" from the novel series Lemony Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" as the dish the Baudelaire children prepare at Count Olaf's house. The dish also features prominently in the movie based on the novels, as well as the Netflix original series. Count Olaf is very upset that they had not prepared roast beef for him instead.\n\nIt is also featured in the fourth part of the manga/anime series \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,\" \"Diamond is Unbreakable.\" In the \"Let's Go Out for Italian\" arc, the characters Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu Nijimura visit a restaurant ran by head chef/owner Tonio Trussardi, the latter of whom is served the dish as his pasta course. Due to the remedial powers of Tonio's stand, Pearl Jam, eating the pasta causes Okuyasu's body to reject two of his rotten teeth from his mouth, which are then replaced by two new ones.\n\n"}

It should not be confused with \"Goulash\", a stew with more gravy or a soup (using meat with bones, paprika, caraway, vegetables and potato or different tiny dumplings or pasta simmered along with the meat), or \"Paprikás\" (using only meat, paprika and thick heavy sour cream).\nThe traditional Hungarian stews: \"Pörkölt\" and \"Paprikás\" along with the traditional soup \"Goulash\" are considered to be the national dishes of Hungary.\n\nThere are different pörkölt variations from region to region. In most parts of Hungary \"pörkölt\" is made with beef or pork. The word \"Pörkölt\" simply means \"roasted\". Pörkölt is made of meat, onion, and sweet paprika powder. Bell peppers, tomatoes or tomato paste, green pepper, marjoram, and garlic are common additions to the basic recipe.\n\nAny kind of meat can be used when making pörkölt. Most common are beef, lamb, chicken and pork, but game, tripe and liver can also be used. A popular meal in traditional Hungarian cuisine is a \"pörkölt\" made of tripe, called \"pacalpörkölt\". (\"Pacal\" is the Hungarian word for tripe). It has a unique and very distinguishable taste from other kinds of \"pörkölt\", often being quite spicy.\n\nMuch of the quality of a pot of \"pörkölt\" is found in the use of the very few ingredients. The spiciness and the taste of the paprika powder used is very important to the taste. A simple Hungarian trick for making good \"pörkölt\" is first frying the onions in lard or oil, before making anything else. Then set aside the pot and immediately add paprika powder and the meat and \"stir-fry\" – (this is the origin of the verb \"pörkölni\" – to roast). This way the juices are kept inside. Water is added, the same volume as the meat. \"Pörkölt\" should be simmered slowly in very little liquid. Flour should never be used to thicken a Hungarian pörkölt.\nIn Hungary \"pörkölt\" is served with pasta (\"tészta\"), \"tarhonya\" (big Hungarian pasta grains) or \"galuska/nokedli\" as a side dish. Boiled potato is also a common garnish, and pickles go with the dish nicely counterbalancing the heavy stew with a touch of sour.\n\nThere is a different style Hungarian \"pörkölt\" stew, \"tokány\", a Transylvanian stew that doesn't emphasize the use of paprika as much as the \"pörkölt\" in Hungary proper. These are stews using black pepper and kitchen herbs like marjoram for spices instead, often made with mixed meats, vegetables and wild mushrooms, depending on the season and the region. \"Tokány\" is often served topped with sour cream, and mostly \"puliszka\" (polenta) or boiled potatoes are being served as the side dish.\n\nIn the Czech Republic\" pörkölt\" is made with pork, beer, dark bread and caraway. Often large Czech \"knedlíky\" dumplings are served with it. In Slovakia the dish is called \"perkelt\" and is served with \"Halušky\" dumplings. Goulash (Polish: \"Gulasz\") is similar to Hungarian \"Pörkölt\", and is also popular in Poland, usually being eaten with potatoes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2570894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2570894", "title": "Börek", "text": "Börek\n\nBörek (; also burek and other variants) is a family of baked filled pastries made of a thin flaky dough such as phyllo or yufka, of Anatolian origins and also found in the cuisines of the Balkans, Levant, Mediterranean, and other countries in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. A börek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. The top of the börek is often sprinkled with sesame seeds.\n\nIt may have been invented in the homeland of wheat, what is now modern Turkey, in the Anatolian Provinces of the Ottoman Empire. It become a popular element of Ottoman cuisine, or it may date back earlier to the Classical era of the eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nBörek may have its origins in Turkish cuisine and may be one of its most significant and, in fact, ancient elements of the Turkish cuisine, having been developed by the Turks of Central Asia before their westward migration to Anatolia in the late Middle Ages, or it may be a descendent of the pre-existing Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Anatolian dish \"en tyritas plakountas\" (Byzantine Greek: εν τυρίτας πλακούντας) \"cheesy placenta,\" itself a descendant of \"placenta\", the classical baked layered dough and cheese dish of Ancient Roman cuisine. Cato included a recipe for placenta in his \"De Agri Cultura\" (160 BC). \n\nThe word börek derives from the Turkish language and refers to any dish made with \"yufka\". Tietze proposes that the word comes from the Turkic root \"bur-\" 'to twist'. Sevortyan offers various alternative etymologies, all of them based on a fronted vowel /ö/ or /ü/. Tietze's proposed source \"bur-\" (with a backed vowel /u/) for büräk/börek (with fronted vowels) is not included, because sound harmony would dictate a suffix \"-aq\" with a harmonised, backed /q/. Turkic languages in Arabic orthography, however, invariably write ك and not ق which rules out \"bur-\" which has a backed vowel /u/ at its core.\n\nThe \"Tatar böregi\" (Tatar börek) is a cheese and mint filled alternative name for the dumpling-like dish called \"mantı\" which very much resemble ravioli.\n\nBörek is very popular in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, especially in North Africa and throughout the Balkans. The Southern also feature derivatives of the börek. Börek is also part of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jewish traditions. They have been enthusiastically adopted by the Ottoman Jewish communities, and have been described, along with boyos de pan and \"bulemas\", as forming \"the trio of preeminent Ottoman Jewish pastries\".\n\nTurkey enjoys a wide variety of regional variations of börek among the different cultures and ethnicities composing it, including:\n\n\nMost of the time, the word \"börek\" is accompanied in Turkish by a descriptive word referring to the shape, ingredients of the pastry, for the cooking methods or for or a specific region where it is typically prepared, as in the above \"kol böreği\", \"su böreği\", \"talaş böreği\" or \"Sarıyer böreği\".\n\nIn Albania, this dish is called \"byrek\" or \"lakror\". In Kosovo and few other regions byrek is also known as \"pite\". The most common fillings include: cheese (especially \"gjizë\", salted curd cheese), ground meat and onions (ragù style filling), spinach and eggs, milk and eggs with pre-baked dough layers, but it can also be made with tomato and onions, peppers and beans, potato or a sweet filling of pumpkin, nettles (known as \"byrek me hithra\"), etc. Lakror generally would have a filling of greens, \"lakër\" being an Albanian word for cabbage but in this context an abbreviation of \"lakër e egër\", a term which describes a family of green leaf vegetables i.e. sorrel, dandelion, scarole, catsear, etc.\n\nByrek is traditionally made with several layers of dough that have been thinly rolled out by hand. The final form can be small, individual triangles, especially from street vendors called 'Byrektore' which sell byrek and other traditional pastries and drinks. It can also be made as one large byrek that is cut into smaller pieces. There are different regional variations of byrek. It can be served cold or hot.\n\nArab börek is often stuffed with minced or diced lamb or beef, or a mixture of the two. Various herbs and spices are used to flavour the meat, including; turmeric, fresh parsley and nutmeg, and concentrated pomegranate juice, which gives the mixture a unique sweet and tangy taste. Fried or caramelised onions are usually added to the meat, as well as the traditional Arab staple of fried almonds and sultanas or raisins. Traditional Arab cheeses, including \"Jibin Baladi\" and \"Jibin Arab\" are often used instead of, or together with the meat. The mixture is wrapped in a sheet of dough, and then fried or deep-fried until crisp, and resembles a large egg roll. While most börek are made with phyllo, some traditional cooks and those in the tribal areas prefer a hand-kneaded dough.\n\nArab börek are most often served with other \"dry\" foods including kibbeh, with a jajik dip (yogurt, cucumber and garlic dip) forming an integral part of a traditional meze meal.\n\nIn Armenia, \"byorek\" (բյորեկ) or borek (բորեկ), consists of dough, or phyllo dough, folded into triangles and stuffed with cheese, spinach or ground beef, and the filling is typically spiced. A popular combination is spinach, feta, cottage cheese (or pot cheese) and a splash of anise-flavoured liquor (such as raki).\n\nAssyrian \"burek\" is usually stuffed with spiced ground beef, though potatoes are also sometimes used instead. The stuffing is wrapped in a sheet of dough and then fried in oil and resembles egg rolls.\n\nThe Bulgarian version of the pastry, locally called \"byurek\" (Cyrillic: бюрек), is typically regarded as a variation of \"banitsa\" (баница), a similar Bulgarian dish. Bulgarian byurek is a type of \"banitsa\" with \"sirene\" cheese, the difference being that byurek also has eggs added.\n\nIn Bulgarian, the word \"byurek\" has also come to be applied to other dishes similarly prepared with cheese and eggs, such as \"chushka byurek\" (чушка бюрек), a peeled and roasted pepper filled with cheese, and \"tikvichka byurek\" (тиквичка бюрек), blanched or uncooked bits of squash with eggs filling.\n\nIn Greece, \"boureki\" (μπουρέκι ) or \"bourekaki\" (μπουρεκάκι , the diminutive form of the word), and Cyprus \"poureki\" (πουρέκι, in the Greek dialects of the island) are small pastries made with phyllo dough or with pastry crust. Pastries in the börek family are also called \"pita\" (pie): \"tiropita\", \"spanakopita\" and so on.\n\nA special type of boureki is found in the local cuisine of Crete and especially in the area of Chania. It is a pie filled with sliced zucchini, sliced potatoes, mizithra or feta cheese and spearmint, and may be baked with or without a thick top crust of phyllo.\n\nIn Venetian Corfu, boureki was also called \"burriche\", and filled with meat and leafy greens.\n\nGalaktoboureko is a syrupy phyllo pastry filled with custard, common throughout Greece and Cyprus. In the Epirus, σκερ-μπουρέκ (derives from the Turkish şeker-börek, \"sugar-börek\") is a small rosewater-flavoured marzipan sweet.\n\nThe Pontian Greek piroski (πιροσκί) derives its name from börek too. It's almost identical in name and form to pirozhki (Russian: пирожки), which is of Slavic origin, and popular in Russia and further east.\n\nIn Israel, \"bourekas\" () became popular as Sephardic Jewish immigrants who settled there cooked the cuisine of their native countries. Bourekas can be found made from either phyllo dough or puff pastry filled with various fillings. The most popular fillings are salty cheese and mashed potato, with other fillings including mushrooms, ground meat, sweet potato, chickpeas, olives, spinach, eggplant and pizza-flavour. Most bourekas in Israel are made with margarine-based doughs rather than butter-based doughs so that (at least the non-cheese filled varieties) can be eaten along with either milk meals or meat meals in accordance with the kosher prohibition against mixing milk and meat at the same meal.\n\nIsraeli bourekas come in several shapes and are often sprinkled with seeds. The shapes and choice of seeds are usually indicative of their fillings and have become fairly standard among small bakeries and large factories alike.\n\nFor example, Salty cheese (Bulgarian cheese)-filled as well as Tzfat cheese (from the city of Safed) with Za'atar-filled bourekas are usually somewhat flat triangles with white sesame seeds on top. Less salty cheese-filled are semi-circular and usually made with puff pastry. Potato-filled are sesame topped, flat squares or rectangles made with phyllo and tend to be less oily than most other versions. Mushroom-filled are bulging triangles with poppy seeds. Tuna-filled are bulging triangles with nigella seeds. Eggplant-filled are cylindrical with nigella seeds. Bean sprout-filled are cylindrical without seeds. Spinach-filled are either cylindrical with sesame seeds or made with a very delicate, oily phyllo dough shaped into round spirals. Bourekas with a pizza sauce are often round spirals rising toward the middle or sometimes cylidrical without seeds, differentiated from the bean sprout-filled cyliders without seeds by the red sauce oozing out the ends.\n\nBourekas can also be found with mashed chickpeas, tuna and chickpea mix, pumpkin and even small cocktail frankfurters. Another variation filled with meat (beef, chicken or lamb), pine nuts, parsley and spices are eaten mainly as a main dish but sometimes as meze. The North African version, Brik can also be found in Israel.\n\nBourekas come in small, \"snack\" size, often available in self-service bakeries, and sizes as large as four or five inches. The larger ones can serve as a snack or a meal, and can be sliced open, and stuffed with hard-boiled egg, pickles, tomatoes and Sahawiq, a spicy Yemenite paste. Supermarkets stock a wide selection of frozen raw-dough bourekas ready for home baking. Bakeries and street vendors dealing exclusively in bourekas can be found in most Israeli cities. Small coffee-shop type establishments as well as lottery and sports betting parlors serving bourekas and coffee can also be found.\n\nMeat bourekas are less common at bakeries and are considered something which is to be made at home. Meat bourekas are made from lamb, beef or chicken mixed with onion, parsley, coriander, or mint, pine nuts and spices, They are served as hot meze.\n\nThe use of margarine in bourekas has caused some controversy in Israel due to a general trend of moving away from trans fats, which are found in many margarines.\n\nBourekas have given their name to Bourekas films, a peculiarly Israeli genre of comic melodramas or tearjerkers based on ethnic stereotypes.\n\nIn certain Italian towns of Emilia-Romagna that were formerly city-states such as Ferrara and Modena, there can still be encountered a half-moon shaped sweet pastry called \"burriche\" or \"burricche\" which has been described as a mediaeval relic of the Ottoman inspired cuisine of the Jewish communities that lived in certain towns of the area.\nThere can be distinguished the \"burriche ferraresi\", to which grappa is being added and which are often filled with mandarin marmelade and which are sometimes called in Ferrarese Ladino \"burichitas\".\nThey resemble in shape and taste the Greek kourabiedes, which are pâte brisée like shortbreads that differ from their Middle Eastern counterparts by having also alcohol such as brandy or mastika added to them.\n\nIn the nations established or reestablished in the stead of the territories of the former Yugoslavia, burek is regularly available at most bakeries, and usually eaten as \"fast food\". It is often consumed with yogurt. Apart from being sold at bakeries, burek is served in specialised stores selling börek (or pitas) and yogurt exclusively (\"Buregdžinica\").\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, \"burek\", also known as \"pita\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively, is an extremely common dish, made with yufka and the Bosnian variant is arguably the most regionally prominent.\n\nIt may be eaten for any meal of the day. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the burek is a meat-filled pastry, traditionally rolled in a spiral and cut into sections for serving.\n\nThe same spiral filled with cottage cheese is called \"sirnica\", with spinach and cheese \"zeljanica\", with potatoes \"krompiruša\", and all of them are generically referred to as \"pita\". Eggs are used as a binding agent when making \"sirnica\" and \"zeljanica\".\n\nThis kind of pastry is also popular in Croatia, where it was imported by Bosnian Croats, and is usually called \"rolani burek\" (rolled burek).\n\nIn Serbian towns, Bosnian pastry dishes were imported by war refugees in the 1990s, and are usually called \"sarajevske pite\" or \"bosanske pite\" (Sarayevan pies or Bosnian pies). Similar dishes, although somewhat wider and with thinner dough layers, are called \"savijača\" or just \"pita\" in Serbia. These are usually homemade and not traditionally offered in bakeries.\n\nIn 2012, Lonely Planet included the Bosnian burek in their \"The World's Best Street Food\" book.\n\nIn Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia, \"burek\" is made from layers of dough, alternating with layers of other fillings in a circular baking pan and then topped with a last layer of dough. Traditionally it may be baked with no filling (\"prazan\", meaning empty), with stewed minced meat and onions, or with cheese. Modern bakeries offer cheese and spinach, apple, sour cherries, potato, mushroom and pizza-burek, as well.\n\nThe recipe for \"round\" burek was developed in the Serbian town of Niš. In 1498, it was introduced by a famous Turkish baker, Mehmed Oğlu from Istanbul. Eventually burek spread from the southeast (southern Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia) to the rest of Yugoslavia.\nNiš hosts an annual burek competition and festival called \"Buregdžijada\". In 2005, a 100 kg (220 lbs) burek was made, with a diameter of 2 metres (≈6 ft) and it is considered to have been the world biggest burek ever made.\n\nIn Slovenia, burek is one of the most popular fast-food dishes, but at least one researcher found that it is viewed negatively by Slovenes due to their prejudices towards immigrants, especially those from other countries of Former Yugoslavia. A publication of a diploma thesis on this at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana in 2010 stirred controversy regarding the appropriateness of the topic. The mentor of the student that had written the thesis described the topic as legitimate and burek as denoting primitive behavior in Slovenia in spite of it being a sophisticated food. He explained the controversy as a good example of the conclusions of the student. Actually, already in 2008, an employee of the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SRC SASA) had attained his PhD degree with a thesis on meta-burek at the University of Nova Gorica.\n\n\"Çibörek\", a national dish of the Crimean Tatars, is made from unleavened dough filled with ground lamb, onions and spices, fried in oil. It is a common street food in countries that were once part of the USSR. \"Cheburek\" is the Russian pronunciation of çibörek, which means \"delicious burek\" or \"raw börek\".\n\nIn Romania, the food falls under the name \"plăcintă\" and is most often made with cheese or cheese and spinach. In Dobrogea, eastern territory that used to be a Turkish province, one can find both the Turkish influence - plăcintă dobrogeana either filled with cheese or with minced meat and served with sheep yoghurt or the Tatar street food Suberek - a deep fried half Moon cheese filled dough.\n\nThe regional cuisine of the Moldavian West bank of the Pruth still yields a type of dumpling-like food called \"burechiuşe\" (sometimes called \"burechiţe\") which is described as dough in the shape of a ravioli-like square which is filled with mushrooms such as Boletus edulis, and sealed around its edges and then tossed and subsequently boiled in borscht like soups or chorbas. They are traditionally eaten in the last day of fasting at the time of the Christmas Eve. It is not clear if the \"burechiuşe\" derive their name from the Turco-Greek \"börek\" (which is a distinct possibility given the fact that Ottoman Moldavia was ruled for many decades by dynasties of Greek Phanariotes who encouraged Greek colonists to settle in the area), so at the receiving end of cultural and culinary influences coming from them, or it takes its name from that of the mushroom Boletus (\"burete\" in its Romanian language rhotacised version, and it meant \"mushroom\" as well as \"sponge\") by the pattern of the ravioli, which were named after the Italian name of the turnip with which they were once filled.\n\nBrik (pronounced breek) is a Tunisian and Algerian derivative of the börek consisting of thin malsouka pastry around a filling, commonly deep fried. The best-known version is the egg brik, a whole egg in a triangular pastry pocket with chopped onion, tuna, harissa and parsley.\n\nBrik pastry (malsouqa or warka) is made by slapping a sticky lump of dough onto a hot non stick surface in overlapping circles to produce the desired size and cooked for a minute or two. Typical fillings include tuna, ground meat, chopped boiled egg, chicken, shrimp, or anchovies garnished with a fried egg and harissa, capers, or cheese.\n\nThe Tunisian tradition is that the bride-to-be's mother makes a brik for the potential bridegroom. If the bridegroom eats it without spilling any of the egg yolk he may marry the bride.\n\nThe dough sheets themselves, are also referred to as walsouka or warka.\n"}

These stores offer a no-frills experience and warehouse shelving stocked well with merchandise intended to move at higher volumes. Unlike warehouse clubs, warehouse stores do not require a membership or membership fees. Warehouse stores also offer a selection of merchandise sold in bulk, Typically warehouse stores are laid out in a logical format which leads people a certain way around the store to the checkout. As one enters the store they are directed down an aisle of discounted special buys when entering the store. From there the layout typically then leads to the fresh Produce followed by the Deli at the back of the store. Also included bakery and other departments similar to other supermarkets. Another typical feature of these stores is that the customer bags their own groceries which also helps to reduce the overall cost. Many warehouse stores are operated by traditional grocery chains both as a way to attract lower income, value conscious consumers and to maximize their buying power in order to lower costs at their mainstream stores. Notable examples of corporations who operate warehouse stores include United States chains Kroger and Albertsons LLC and the smaller Sacramento-based Nugget Market.

{"id": "2577545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2577545", "title": "Seudat mitzvah", "text": "Seudat mitzvah\n\nA seudat mitzvah (, \"commanded meal\"), in Judaism, is an obligatory festive meal, usually referring to the celebratory meal following the fulfillment of a \"mitzvah\" (commandment), such as a bar mitzvah, a wedding, a \"brit milah\" (ritual circumcision), or a \"siyum\" (completing a tractate of Talmud or Mishnah). \"Seudot\" fixed in the calendar (i.e., for holidays and fasts) are also considered \"seudot mitzvah\", but many have their own, more commonly used, names.\n\nAttendance at a \"brit milah\" (circumcision) and its subsequent \"seudah\" is of such great significance that Rabbi Moshe Isserles (\"the Rama\") notes (\"Yoreh De'ah\" 265:12) that one who is invited but does not participate in the \"seudat brit milah\" is excommunicated from Hashem (God). (Babylonian Talmud tractate \"Pesachim\" 113b; Tosafot \"Pesachim\" 114a s.v. \"Veein\"). For this reason, people are generally not invited, but merely informed of the \"brit\"'s time and location (Pitchei Teshuva Y.D. 265:18; \"Arukh HaShulkhan\" 265:37). Talmudic sages have compared a \"brit\" to a \"Korban\" (Temple offering), and eating at a \"seudat brit milah\" to eating a Temple offering. Hasidic Jews generally insist on serving meat at a \"seudat brit milah\" since most Temple offerings were meat. Sharing a meal is considered a bonding experience celebrating the covenant between God and the Jewish people.\n\nUnlike other \"seudot mitzvah\" in which the meal (\"seudah\") follows the act or ceremony which warrants the festive meal, the redemption ceremony for a first-born Jewish male child (called \"Pidyon HaBen\" in Hebrew), is actually \"part\" of the meal. The ceremony is led by a kohen, who ritually washes his hands, recites the blessing over bread, and partakes of some bread before beginning the ceremony. The ceremony, which follows a traditional text, is a verbal exchange between the kohen and the father of the child. The kohen asks the father if he prefers to keep his money, or pay the equivalent of five silver shekels to redeem his child. The father chooses the latter option and hands over the money, as well as recites a special blessing (\"\"al pidyon haben\"\"). Then the kohen verbalizes the redemption, blesses the child, and says the traditional blessing over a cup of wine, which he then drinks. The \"seudat mitzvah\" continues with all guests in attendance washing for bread and partaking of the festive meal.\n\nWhile attending the \"seudah\" for a \"Pidyon Haben\", the Vilna Gaon was asked whether it was true that all the Torah's commandments are alluded to in \"Bereishit\", the first portion of the Torah. After the Gaon affirmed this, he was asked where the commandment of \"pidyon haben\" was alluded to and the Gaon replied that it was in the word \"Bereishit\", the Hebrew initials which stand for \"Ben Rishon Achar Sheloshim Yom Tifdeh\" or \"a firstborn son after thirty days redeem\".\n\nRabbi Shlomo Luria (\"Maharshal\") notes that the occasion of a youth becoming obligated to obey the commandments is to be celebrated with a religious feast, usually including a sermon the youth has prepared (\"Yam Shel Shlomo\", \"Bava Kamma\" 7:37). It is customary at a \"bar mitzvah\" meal for parents to give thanks and praise to God for giving them the merit to raise a child to \"bar mitzvah\" and to educate him in the ways of Torah and the commandments. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that a Bat Mitzvah is also a seudat mitzvah.\n\nBased on the Talmud and Midrash, the \"seudah\" celebration upon the completion of a Talmudic tractate is considered a \"seudat mitzvah\" (\"Yam Shel Shlomo\", \"Bava Kamma\", \"Merubah\" 37; \"Maharam Mintz\" 119; \"Shach\", \"Yoreh De'ah\" 246:37). This \"seudah\" is made to rejoice over the accomplishment, and also to motivate and inspire others to do the same. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Shapiro (the \"Munkatcher Rebbe\") observes in his work \"Sha'ar Yissachar\" that the evil inclination does not want to see this type of shared joy, noting that one of the names of the evil inclination, \"Sama'el,\" may be seen as an acronym for \"Siyum Masechet Ain La'asot\", or \"do not make a siyum\".\n\nDuring the festive meal following a Jewish wedding ceremony (Hebrew \"Nissuin\"), guests participate in the mitzvah (commandment) of \"L'Sameach Chatan v'Kallah\", to bring joy to the groom and bride. The emphasis of the celebration is on entertaining the newlyweds. At Orthodox wedding meals, men and women dance separately - sometimes separated by a divider - for reasons of modesty. At the end of the \"seudat nissuin\", Grace After Meals is recited, and the \"Sheva Berachot\" (seven blessings) that were recited under the wedding canopy are repeated.\n\n\"Seudat Havraah\" is the \"meal of consolation\" or comfort provided for a mourner upon his or her return from the cemetery following interment of the deceased. It usually consists of foods symbolic of life such as boiled eggs and lentil soup. The Talmud in \"Bava Batra\" (16b) states that the lentil stew Jacob was preparing (Genesis 25:29), and for which Esau sold his birthright, was the \"seudat havraah\" for his father Isaac who was beginning to sit \"shiva\" for \"his\" father Abraham.\n\nThese include three meals on the Sabbath, as well as two (dinner and lunch) on each festival day making four each (outside Israel) for Shavuot, Rosh HaShana, Sukkot, two each for Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, eight (outside Israel) for Passover. The Passover Seders are \"seudot mitzvah\". Except for \"Seudah Shlishit\" (the \"third meal\" of Shabbat) all of these meals are preceded by \"Kiddush\" (the blessing, made over wine, recognizing the holiness of the day). If one recites \"Kiddush\", Jewish law states that one must immediately eat the \"seudah\" in the same place that he heard/recited \"Kiddush\" (\"Talmud Bavli\", \"Pesachim\" 101a). At Shabbat meals, it is customary to sing \"Zemirot\" (songs), learn Torah (as at meals in general) and discuss the week's portion of Scripture.\n\n\"Seudah HaMafseket\" is the \"separating meal\" eaten before the fasts of Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av.\n\nAt the pre-Tisha B'Av meal it is forbidden to eat meat (Mishna, \"Taanit\" 26b; Babylonian Talmud ibid. 30a), wine, and fish, or more than one cooked food. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided. The meal is eaten sitting on the ground or a low seat. It is customary to eat a hardboiled egg, and also a piece of bread dipped into ashes, and to say, \"This is the Tisha B'Av meal.\" During the meal, three men should not sit together so they will not have to recite the Grace after Meals as a group. None of these restrictions apply when the eve of Tisha B'Av falls on the Sabbath.\n\nThe pre-Yom Kippur meal is a festive meal, which may include meat.\n\nOn Purim day, typically toward evening, a festive meal called \"Seudat Purim\" is held, with wine as a prominent beverage, where drunkenness is not uncommon. The custom of drinking at this meal stems from a statement in the Talmud attributed to a rabbi named Rava that says one should drink on Purim until he can \"no longer distinguish between \"arur Haman\" ('Cursed is Haman') and \"baruch Mordechai\" ('Blessed is Mordecai').\" The reason Rava instituted the custom of drinking was likely as a critique of treating Mordecai as a hero, instead of a villain. Another view is that these phrases have the same numerical value, and some authorities, including the \"Be'er Hagolah\" and \"Magen Avraham\", have ruled that one should drink wine until he is unable to calculate these numerical values.)\n\nThis saying was codified in the Rif, Rosh, \"Tur\", \"Shulchan Aruch\" (\"Orach Chayim\" 695), and is interpreted simply (as explained above) by the \"Chatam Sofer\". This interpretation of the Talmudic statement, or the acceptance of the statement itself, is disputed (for various reasons) by the \"Ba'alei Tosafot\" (based on the Jerusalem Talmud), Maimonides, Rabbeinu Ephraim, \"Ba'al HaMa'or\", Ran, \"Orchot Chaim\", \"Be'er Hagolah\", \"Magen Avraham\", \"Taz\", Rema, Vilna Gaon, Maharsha, Rashash, \"Tzeidah LaDerech\", \"Hagahot Maimoniyot\", Ra'avyah, \"Korban N'tan'el\", \"Bach\", Maharil, \"P'ri M'gadim\", \"Kol Bo\", \"Chochmat Mano'ach\", \"Mishnah Berurah\" (by the Chafetz Chaim), and others. These authorities all advocate drinking wine in some quantity, but all (excepting \"Hagahot Maimoniyot\" and Ra'avyah) discourage the level of drunkenness suggested by the \"Chatam Sofer\". The Rema says that one should only drink a little more than he is used to drinking, and then try to fall asleep (whereupon he certainly will not be able to tell the difference between the two phrases indicated by the Talmud). This position is shared by the \"Kol Bo\" and \"Mishnah Berurah\", and is similar to that of Maimonides.\n\n"}

The candies are usually wrapped in green foil and imprinted with the company's logo, the word \"Andes\" written amidst a drawing of snow-capped peaks. First launched in 1950, they are produced by Tootsie Roll Industries and made in Delavan, Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1921, Andrew Kanelos opened a small candy store in Chicago, Illinois. While he initially called his store \"Andy's Candies\" in reference to himself, he quickly found that men did not like giving boxes of candy with another man's name to their wives and girlfriends. As such, he changed the spelling of the business to \"Andes Candies.\" In 1980, Andes was purchased by the Swiss candy company Interfood (later Jacobs Suchard). When Jacobs Suchard bought Brach's in 1987, Andes became part of that division. When Jacobs Suchard was sold to Kraft General Foods in 1990, Brach's was kept separate by owner Klaus J. Jacobs. In need of cash, Brach's sold Andes to Tootsie Roll Industries in 2000.\n\nIn the United States, Andes mints are a popular after-dinner mint and are often distributed at restaurants, particularly Olive Garden. The mint used at Olive Garden is a special flavor manufactured exclusively for the restaurant chain, but it is tastewise similar to the Mint Parfait flavor, containing the same layers, but at different ratios.\n\nThe most common Andes mint is 1.5 × 0.75 × 0.25 inches, weighs 4.75 grams, and contains 25 calories.

It is considered by many to be the national dish of Myanmar. It is readily available in most parts of the country. In major cities, street hawkers and roadside stalls sell dozens of dishes of mohinga to the locals and passers-by. Usually eaten for breakfast, today the dish is being consumed more and more throughout the day.\n\nThere are different varieties of mohinga in various regions of Myanmar. Rakhine mohinga has more fish paste and less soup. Its ingredients depend on their availability. However, the standard dish comes from southern Myanmar, where fresh fish is more readily available. The main ingredients of mohinga are chickpea flour and/or crushed toasted rice, garlic, onions, lemongrass, banana tree stems, ginger, fish paste, fish sauce, and catfish in a rich broth cooked and kept on the boil in a cauldron. It is served with rice vermicelli, dressed and garnished with fish sauce, a squeeze of lime, crisp fried onions, coriander, spring onions, crushed dried chillis, and, as optional extras, crisp fried fritters such as split chickpeas (') (), urad dal (') () or gourd (\"\") () or sliced pieces of Chinese donuts (), as well as boiled egg and fried fish cake ().\n\nIt is perhaps the most popular breakfast dish of all, now available as an \"all-day breakfast\" in many towns and cities. Mohinga is also served with all the trimmings at formal functions and it is also sold in dry packets as a ready-made powder that is used for making the broth. Street hawkers are the original purveyors of this popular dish doing the rounds through neighborhoods where they have regular customers. They carry the soup cauldron on a stove on one side of a shoulder pole and rice vermicelli and other ingredients along with bowls and spoons on the other. It used to be available only early in the morning and at street \"pwè\"s or open air stage performances and \"zat pwè\"s or itinerant theatres at night. Trishaw peddlers began to appear in the 1960s and some of them set up pavement stalls making mohinga available all day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2582022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2582022", "title": "Cypriot cuisine", "text": "Cypriot cuisine\n\nCypriot cuisine is the cuisine of Cyprus and is closely related to Greek and Turkish cuisine; it has also been influenced by Byzantine, French, Italian, Catalan, Ottoman and Middle Eastern cuisines.\n\nFrequently used ingredients are fresh vegetables such as zucchini, green peppers, okra, green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans (for fasolia), broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. Pears, apples, grapes, oranges, Mandarin oranges, nectarines, mespila, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, citrus, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, hazelnut are some of the commonest of the fruits and nuts. \n\nThe best-known spices and herbs include pepper, parsley, arugula, celery, fresh coriander (cilantro), thyme, and oregano. Traditionally, cumin and coriander seeds make up the main cooking aromas of the island. Mint is a very important herb in Cyprus. It grows abundantly, and locals use it for everything, particularly in dishes containing ground meat. For example, the Cypriot version of pastitsio (locally known as \"macaronia tou fournou\" or \"makarna fırında\") contains very little tomato and generous amounts of mint. The same is true of \"keftedes\" or \"köfte\" (meatballs), which are sometimes laced with mint to provide a contrast with the meat. For Turkish Cypriots potato is also often used in making keftedes. Fresh coriander or cilantro (commonly known as \"kolyandro\" or \"kolliandros\" on the island) is another commonly used herb. It is often used in salads, olive breads, spinach pies (\"spanakopita\" or \"ispanak böreği\") and other pastries. In some regions of the island it is also used to flavour hot dishes, particularly tomato-based ones, such as \"yiachnista\".\n\nMeats grilled over charcoal are known as souvla or şiş, named after the skewers on which they are prepared. Most commonly these are souvlaki of pork, beef, lamb or chicken and sheftalia, but grilled halloumi or hellim cheese, mushrooms, and uniquely to the Greek Cypriots loukaniko (pork sausages) are also served. They are typically stuffed into a pitta or pide or wrapped in a thin flatbread, along with a salad of cabbage, parsley, thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and sliced cucumber. Although less popular than souvlaki and sheftalia, Gyros or Döner is also commonly eaten. Gyros is grilled meat slices instead of chunks, and the taste is made different by the salad or dressings added. It is made from various cuts of lamb, pork, or chicken, and sometimes but rarely beef. \n\n\"Pourgouri\" or bulgur, is the traditional carbohydrate other than bread. It is often steamed with tomato and onion; a few strands of vermicelli pasta are often added to provide a texture, fragrance, colour and flavour contrast. Along with pourgouri, natural yogurt is a staple. Wheat and yogurt come together in the traditional peasant meal of \"tarhana/trahanas\", a way of preserving milk in which the cracked wheat is steamed, mixed with sour milk, dried, and stored. Small amounts reheated in water or broth provide a nourishing and tasty meal, especially with added cubes of aged halloumi. Pourgouri is also used to make \"koupes\" or \"içli/bulgur köfte\", the Cypriot form of kibbeh, where the pourgouri is mixed with flour and water to form a dough, which is formed into a cigar shape. A hollow is made through the cigar and a mixture of minced meat, onions, parsley and cinnamon is packed. After sealing the meat mixture inside the cigar they are deep-fried before serving with lemon juice. \n\nFor Greek Cypriots, there are many fasting days defined by the Orthodox Church, and though not everyone adheres, many do. On these days, effectively all animal products must not be consumed. Pulses are eaten instead, sometimes cooked in tomato sauce (Greek: \"yiahni\" or Turkish: \"yahni\") but more usually simply prepared and dressed with olive oil and lemon. On some days, even olive oil is not allowed. These meals often consist of raw onion, raw garlic, and dried red chili which is munched along with these austere dishes to add a variety of taste, though this practice is dying out.\n\nPopular seafood dishes include calamari, octopus, cuttlefish, red mullet (\"parpouni/barbun\"), sea bass (\"lavraki/levrek\"), and gilt-head bream (\"çipura\"). Octopus, due to its peculiar taste and texture, is made into a \"stiffado\" (stew) with red wine, carrots, tomatoes, and onions. Calamari is either cut into rings and fried in batter or is stuffed whole with rice, cumin, cloves, sometimes adding mint to the stuffing, and then baked or grilled. Cuttlefish (\"soupies\") may be cooked like calamari or like octopus in red wine with onions. It is sometimes prepared with spinach, but without adding garden peas, which are a popular accompaniment for cuttlefish in Turkey (specially in west and south coast), some parts of Greece, and Italy. Calamari, octopus, and cuttlefish commonly feature in meze, a spread of small dishes served as an extensive set of entrées.\n\nThe most traditional fish is salt cod, which up until very recently was baked in the outdoor beehive ovens with potatoes and tomatoes in season. Gilt-head bream is popular because it is relatively inexpensive and like sea bass extensively farmed. Until recently, salted herrings bought whole out of wooden barrels were a staple food. They are still enjoyed, but not as much now, as fresh fish and meat are regular alternatives.\n\nMany fish restaurants also include in the fish meze a variety of different food which include fish, for example fish souffle and fish croquettes.\n\nCyprus potatoes are long and waxy with a unique taste, exported internationally. Locals love them baked in the oven, preferably the outdoor beehive fourni. Many Cypriots add salt, cumin, oregano, and some finely sliced onion. When they barbecue, some Cypriots put potatoes into foil and sit them in the charcoal to make them like jacket potatoes – served with butter or as a side dish to salad and meat.\n\nSalad vegetables are eaten at every meal, sometimes whole. More often, they are prepared chopped, sliced, and dressed with lemon and olive oil. In the summer, the usual salad is of celery leaves and stalks, parsley, coriander leaves, tomatoes, and cucumber. Summer purslane (\"glystridha\") is very popular as are wild dandelion leaves. \n\nIn the early spring, artichokes are in season. Cypriots eat the leaves by detaching and biting off the fleshy base. A common preparation for the stalks and the heart is braised with garden peas, with a little onion and perhaps a chopped tomato. Meat is sometimes added.\n\n\"Bamies\" (okra or ladies' fingers) are baked in the oven with tomato and oil, and \"kounoupidhi\" (cauliflower) is also given this treatment. Cauliflower is also made into \"moungra\", a sour pickle covered with a marinade of vinegar, yeast, and mustard seeds. It is also cooked in tomato sauce, onions and mince meat.\n\n\"Vazania/patlican\" (aubergines) can be prepared in a variety of ways, including stuffed and in moussaka. They are commonly fried and stewed slowly in oil, where the cooking time brings out the flavour and also allows them to shed the oil they have absorbed. Turkish Cypriots hollow them, fry them, stuff them with tomatoes and garlic or mince meat and tomato paste, cook them in the oven and garnish with parsley.\n\nPrior to Cyprus' urbanisation, Cypriots traditionally ate fresh meat on weekends. This was usually a boiled chicken, served with a starch (usually pasta or pourgouri) cooked in its juices. This would stretch the meat to enable the whole family to eat. Other fresh meat dishes were only enjoyed occasionally, sometimes en masse as a feast such as a wedding. Now, as people are better off and meat is widely available, traditional meat dishes are enjoyed frequently.\n\n\"Afelia\", when well prepared, is a saute of pork, red wine, and coriander seeds. \"Psito\" is large chunks of meat and potatoes cooked in the oven. Plenty of fat is used in its preparation; traditionally, this would have been rendered pig fat, but now sunflower oil is used. Olive oil is used as a dressing for salads, vegetables, and pulses but is not used to cook meat dishes.\n\nPreserved pork is very popular, and before refrigeration, it was the main source of red meat available to Cypriots. Before refrigeration became widespread in the 19th century it was tradition to throw away the preserved pork in summertime. Cypriots also add red wine; therefore, there is a characteristic flavour to most of the charcuterie from the island.\n\nLountza is made from the pork tenderloin. After the initial brining and marinading in wine, it is smoked. Although it can be aged, many prefer younger, milder lountza. It is often cooked over coals or fried with eggs to act as a sandwich filler or as part of a meze. Stronger than lountza and made from the leg, is \"chiromeri\", which is similar to any smoked, air-dried ham from Southern Europe, although the wine flavour makes it characteristically Cypriot. In non-mountain areas, the same meat used for chiromeri is cut into strips along the muscle compartments and dried in the sun as \"basta\". The shoulder of a freshly slaughtered animal is cut into chunks about the size of an almond along with a smaller quantity of chopped back fat, which are marinated in wine and brined, stuffed into intestines, and smoked as sausages (loukaniko).\n\nA traditional practice that is dying out fast is to render pig fat for use as a cooking medium and a preservative. Loukaniko and also chunks of fried salted pork meat and fat can be stored in earthenware jars submerged in the lard for a long time, even in the heat of the island.\n\nLamb and goat meat is also preserved as \"samarella\", made very salty to prevent the fatty lamb meat from going rancid. Very popular amongst both communities is preserved beef. The whole silversides and briskets are salted and spiced quite powerfully to make pastourma/bastirma. The same meat and some fat is chopped finely and made into pastourma-loukaniko sausages.\n\nMany Cypriots consider snails a delicacy. Snails are in season in late autumn, when the first good rains arrive after the hot summer. The most popular way to prepare snails is to barbecue them. Another popular variation is to cook them with onions, garlic and tomatoes.\n\nMore controversially, the Cypriot dish of ambelopoulia, though strictly illegal, is still widely enjoyed.\n\nMezedes is a large selection of dishes with small helpings of varied foods, brought to the table as a progression of tastes and textures. The meal begins with black and green olives, tahini, skordalia (potato and garlic dip), humus, taramosalata (fish roe dip), and tzatziki/çaçık (ttalattouri in Cypriot), all served with chunks of fresh bread and a bowl of mixed salad. Some of the more unusual meze dishes include octopus in red wine, snails in tomato sauce, brains with pickled capers, samarella (salted dried meat), quails, pickled quail eggs, tongue, kappari pickles (capers), and \"moungra\" (pickled cauliflower). Bunches of greens, some raw, some dressed with lemon juice and salt, are a basic feature of the meze table. The meal continues with fish, grilled halloumi cheese, \"lountza\" (smoked pork tenderloin), \"keftedes\" (minced meatballs), sheftalia (pork rissoles), and loukaniko (pork sausages). Hot grilled meats – kebabs, lamb chops, chicken – may be served toward the end. The dessert is usually fresh fruit or glyka – traditional sugar-preserved fruits and nuts.\n\n\"Loukoumades\" (fried doughballs in syrup), loukoum, \"ravani\", tulumba and baklava are well-known local desserts.\nThere are also \"pastiș\", cookies made of ground almonds, that are offered to guests at weddings. \n\nFlaounes are savoury Easter pastries that contain goats cheese (or a variety of cheeses), eggs, spices and herbs all wrapped in a yeast pastry, then brushed with egg yolk and dipped into sesame seeds.\n\nCypriots also make many traditional sweets that are usually made of turunch/ bergamot, figs, tiny aubergines, fresh fleshy walnuts, watermelon or pumpkins processed akin to jam but without the over-cooking. The fruit is soaked for two weeks (depending upon the fruit) then boiled with sugar until the correct texture is obtained.\n\nSweet syrups and spreads include soumada () made from almonds. Soumada has a very ancient history in Cyprus, stretching back into the Roman period, and it was given as an exotic eastern delicacy by King Peter I of Cyprus to King Casimir the Great of Poland at the Congress of Kraków, held in Poland in 1364. Also popular is mahalepi;, a kind of blancmange made from corn flour usually flavoured with rose water or mahlep.\n\nCyprus delights, or loukoumia (), are one of Cyprus's protected geographical indication (PGI) by the European Union. It is a family of confections based on a gel of starch and sugar, flavored with lemon, rose water, mastic or other fruits with or without chopped dates, pistachios and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel. The main centres for its production are Yeroskipou near Paphos and Pano Lefkara near Larnaca. A similar looking sweet is \"soujouk\" or \"shoushouko\", although it is made very differently from loukoumia, being produced from boiled grape juice.\n\nHalloumi is a semi-hard white-brined cheese with elastic texture, made in a rectangular shape from a mixture of goat and sheep milk; it may be sliced and eaten fresh, grilled, or fried. Aged halloumi may be grated over pasta dishes. It is the national cheese of Cyprus.\n\nAnari, from Greek (αναρή) is a crumbly fresh whey cheese, similar to ricotta, made from goat or sheep milk. Two varieties exist, dry and fresh anari. Dry anari is salted and is much harder than the fresh variety, and is served grated with pasta dishes and Giouvetsi, while fresh anari is eaten in slices with honey or carob syrup.\n\nAyran is a traditional drink made of milk. Its recipe varies from region to region.\n\"Triantafyllo\", a thick concentrated dark pink syrup (rose cordial) made from the extract of the Cyprus (Damascus) rose, has water or milk added to make a refreshing sweet cordial, especially in summer. It is distinct from \"rodostagma\" (literally \"rose drops\") (rose water) and \"anthonero\" (blossom water), which are used to sweeten mahallepi and other sweetmeats.\n\nAmong Cypriots traditional brandy and zivania are of the most popular drinks on the island. The second popular drink is beer. The local breweries of KEO and Carlsberg command the lion's share of the market. In Northern Cyprus, Efes is the most widely sold. Evidence of wine production on Cyprus goes back for millennia. Commandaria, the oldest wine in continuous production, is a popular dessert wine.\n\nCyprus also has a tradition of brandy production, with production by various Limassol-based distilleries since 1871. Cypriot brandy is commonly drunk with meze dishes, and forms the base for the distinctive brandy sour cocktail, developed on the island in the late 1930s. Zivania, a grape distillate similar to Cretan raki, is another popular spirit.\n\n\n\n"}

Apart from \"work of art\", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of visual art: \nUsed more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:\n\nThis article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural-music and written word-literature have similar issues and philosophies. The term \"objet d'art\" is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical). The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.\n\nA \"work of art\" in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent aesthetic function. A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger art movement or artistic era, such as: a genre, aesthetic convention, culture, or regional-national distinction. It can also be seen as an item within an artist's \"body of work\" or \"oeuvre\". The term is commonly used by: museum and cultural heritage curators, the interested public, the art patron-private art collector community, and art galleries.\n\nPhysical objects that document immaterial or conceptual art works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some Dada and Neo-Dada conceptual and readymade works have received later inclusion. Also, some architectural renderings and models of unbuilt projects, such as by Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frank Gehry, are other examples.\n\nThe products of environmental design, depending on intention and execution, can be \"works of art\" and include: land art, site-specific art, architecture, gardens, landscape architecture, installation art, rock art, and megalithic monuments.\n\nLegal definitions of \"work of art\" are used in copyright law; \"see \".\n\nMarcel Duchamp critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice. Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.\n\nArtist Michael Craig-Martin, creator of \"An Oak Tree\", said of his work – \"\"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water.\"\"\n\nSome art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity-status as an artwork. For example, a painting by Rembrandt has a physical existence as an \"oil painting on canvas\" that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece \"work of art\" or the artist's \"magnum opus\". Many works of art are initially denied \"museum quality\" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the Impressionists and non-representational abstract artists are examples. Some, such as the \"Readymades\" of Marcel Duchamp including his infamous urinal \"Fountain\", are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.\n\nThere is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between \"fine art\" objects made by \"artists\"; and folk art, craft-work, or \"applied art\" objects made by \"first, second, or third-world\" designers, artisans and craftspeople. Contemporary and archeological indigenous art, industrial design items in limited or mass production, and places created by environmental designers and cultural landscapes, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.\n\n\n"}

When these animals are enclosed, such as in an Emlen funnel, \"Zugunruhe\" serves to study the seasonal cycles of the migratory syndrome. \"Zugunruhe\" involves increased activity towards and after dusk with changes in the normal sleep pattern.\n\n\"In accordance with their inherited calendars, birds get an urge to move. When migratory birds are held in captivity, they hop about, flutter their wings and flit from perch to perch just as birds of the same species are migrating in the wild. The caged birds ‘know’ they should be travelling too. This migratory restlessness, or Zugunruhe, was first described by Johann Andreas Naumann…[who] interpreted Zugunruhe to be an expression of the migratory instinct in birds.\"\n\n--William Fiennes, ‘The Snow Geese’\n\n\"Zugunruhe\" has been artificially induced in experiments by simulating long days. Some studies on White-crowned Sparrows have suggested that prolactin is involved in the pre-migratory hyperphagia (feeding), fattening and \"Zugunruhe\". However, others have found that prolactin may merely be associated with lipogenesis (fat accumulation).\n\nResearchers have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration by studying \"Zugunruhe\".\n\nThe phenomenon of \"Zugunruhe\" was generally believed to be found only in migratory species; however, a study of a resident species has shown low-level \"Zugunruhe\", including oriented activity, suggesting that the endogenous mechanisms for migratory behaviour may be present even in a resident species. Further suggestions for endogenous programs are provided by observations that the number of nights on which \"Zugunruhe\" is exhibited by caged migrants appears related to the distance of migration involved.\n"}

Apart from the many local fan clubs in Italy whose main role is (for example) to provide a meeting place for fans and friends and organize away trips, since the late 1960s many Italian fans rely on organized stadium groups known as Ultras. The main goal is to choreograph fan support with flags, banners, coloured smoke screens, flares, drums, and chanting in unison. For most teams city rivalries, colours, coat of arms, symbols, and the overall iconography have roots in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance.\n\nIt has become common to use the word Tifosi to refer to the supporters of Scuderia Ferrari in Formula One. Italian motor racing fans are well known for their love of Ferrari, though they have also been staunch supporters of other Italian cars such as Maserati, Lancia and Alfa Romeo.\n\nThe Tifosi provide Formula One with some of its most stunning images, as a sea of red fills the grandstands at the Italian Grand Prix. A similar sight could be observed in former years during the San Marino race which was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near the town of Imola, only 80 km (49.7 mi) east of the Ferrari factory in Maranello.\n\nOne of the most common Tifosi sights is the display of an enormous Ferrari flag in the grandstands during Formula One weekends at every race circuit, with especially large contingents showing up in Ferrari livery at home and nearby European tracks.\n\nIt has not been uncommon for the Tifosi in Italy to actually cheer for a non-Italian driver in a Ferrari passing an Italian driver in another make of car for the lead of a race. At the 1983 San Marino Grand Prix, the crowd at Imola cheered long and loud when Riccardo Patrese crashed his Brabham out of the lead of the race only 6 laps from home, handing Frenchman Patrick Tambay the win in his Ferrari. Patrese himself had only passed Tambay for the lead half a lap earlier.\n\nThe recent increase in their ranks can be directly traced to the rise of Michael Schumacher, who drove for Ferrari from 1996 to 2006, leading the team to the Constructors' Championship from 1999–2004.\n\nOne driver who never actually drove for the Prancing Horse, but will forever hold a special place in the hearts of the Tifosi is Frenchman Jean-Louis Schlesser.

According to the chef Raymond Blanc, \"pot-au-feu\" is \"the quintessence of French family cuisine, it is the most celebrated dish in France. It honours the tables of the rich and poor alike.\"\n\nIt is difficult to know when the name \"pot-au-feu\" first appeared and when its meaning changed to describe the dish instead of the pot in which it is cooked. While \"pot\" was used to describe the rounded pot to cook on the fire at least since the 11th century (even in English), there seems to be no written trace of \"pot-au-feu\" until 1673.\n\nIn 1600, King Henry IV of France (1553-1610) declared, \"I want no peasant in my kingdom to be so poor that he cannot have a \"poule au pot\" on Sundays.\" \"Poule au pot\" literally means \"chicken in the pot\" and the so-called traditional recipe resembles the one of \"pot-au-feu\". However, peasants' food was mainly based on bread (c. 500 g/day), root vegetables, in-season vegetables and soup. They rarely ate meat except salted pork, hog-grease, bacon, or other meat, whether it was during religious celebrations or when they dared to poach game from their lord's land. For people living in towns, it was easier to buy inexpensive pieces of meat, which needed long cooking times.\n\nThe method of cooking all food together and for extended periods of time (the whole day sometimes) gave what was called a \"\"pot-pourri\"\" in French and imported into English in the early 17th century. The relation between \"pot-pourri\" and \"pot-au-feu\" was attested in 1829 in the \"Etymologic dictionary of the French language: \"\"Pot pourri. The name our fathers gave to the \"pot-au-feu\"\"\".\n\nThe cuts of beef and the vegetables involved vary, but a typical \"pot-au-feu\" contains:\n\nCooking cartilaginous meat in the stew will result in gelatin being dissolved into the broth. If the stew is allowed to cool, the broth may turn into a jelly. Allowing the stew to cool also allows the removal of excess fat, which floats on the surface and solidifies. In order to give the broth a slightly smoked taste and its typical brown color, onions are cut in half then charred in a frying pan protected by aluminum foil until the onion's surface is completely black. The cloves are driven into the onions so that both onions and cloves can be removed easily before serving.\n\nTraditionally, the broth is served first with a bit of nutmeg and the marrow (if a marrowbone was used) spread on toasted bread. Then the meat and the vegetables are served with coarse salt and strong Dijon mustard, horseradish sauce, and sometimes also with gherkins pickled in vinegar.\n\n\"Pot-au-feu\" broth may also be used as a soup (often enriched with rice, pasta or toasted bread), as a base for sauces, or for cooking vegetables or pasta. Ready-to-use concentrated cubes are available to make what purports to be \"pot-au-feu\" broth when water is added.\n\nMany countries have similar dishes with local ingredients. Even within France, ingredients may differ from one region to another and with the season.\n"}

For example: the word \"masculine\" contains the word \"male\", which is a synonym of the first word; similarly, the word \"alone\" contains its synonym \"lone\".\nThe etymology of the phrase \"kangaroo word\" is from the fact that kangaroos carry their young, known as joeys, in a body pouch. Likewise, \"kangaroo words\" carry their \"joey words\" within themselves. A \"twin kangaroo\" is a kangaroo word that contains two joey words (for example: \"container\" features both \"tin\" and \"can\"). In contrast, an \"anti-kangaroo\" word is a word that contains its antonym (for example: \"covert\" carries \"overt\", \"animosity\" carries \"amity\").\n\nSome compilers require that the letters of the joey word not be consecutive within the kangaroo word, or that the kangaroo and joey words must be etymologically unrelated.\n\nKangaroo words were originally popularized as a word game by Ben O'Dell in an article for \"The American Magazine\", volume 151, during the 1950s.

It may include other ingredients such as sugar, mustard, salt, thickener, spices, flavouring and colouring. The first ready-made commercial product was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1914, where it is used as a salad dressing and a sandwich spread. Due to the higher cost of ingredients during periods of rationing in the United Kingdom a flavour similar to mayonnaise was achieved in the creation of salad cream.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it has been produced by companies including H. J. Heinz Company and Crosse & Blackwell. Heinz Salad Cream was the first brand developed exclusively for the United Kingdom market. When first created in the Harlesden (London) kitchens of Heinz in 1914, the preparation was done by hand. The jars were packed in straw-lined barrels with 12 dozen in each. The work schedule was 180 dozen jars a day, with a halfpenny a dozen bonus if the workforce could beat the target.\n\nSalad cream was not readily available in the United States until the 21st century (though Miracle Whip provided a similar, if thicker alternative); however, with the large population of British expatriates, especially in the Northeast, it is becoming more common. Major retail supermarket chains sell salad cream as a regular item. Many supermarkets sell national and store brands of salad dressing which resemble salad cream.\n\n\n"}

Most of the Hindu deities are shown as having several faces. \n\nThe origin of Sri Panchamukhi Hanuman can be traced to a story in Ramayana.\nDuring the war between Lord Rama and Ravana, Ravana took help of Ahiravana, the king of Pathala.\nLord Hanuman in order to protect Lord Rama and Lakshman formed a fortress with his tail. Ahiravana took the form of Vibhishana the noble brother of Ravana and took Lord Rama and Lakshman to Pathala loka.\n\nHanuman entered pathala loka in search of Rama and Lakshmana, He found that life of Ahiravana was hidden in the five lamps which were placed in different directions. He could be killed only by extinguishing all five lamps the same time. To accomplish this Hanuman had to take the form of Panchamukha Hanuman. This form of Hanuman has five faces. Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda and Varaha are the four other faces along with Hanuman's face. Hanuman, using the five faces in different directions, blew out the lamps thereby killing Ahiravana.\n\nAccording to Hanumath Prakaranam in Sri Vidyarnavatantram, Anjaneya has five faces (Pancha Mukha) and ten weapons. Hanuman is a great yogi (mystic) having transcended the five senses (Pancha Indriyas). In Kamba Ramayanam (in Tamil), the significance of number five is beautifully narrated as follows: The son of one of the five elements (son of wind - Pavana Thanaya) crossed one of the five elements (water – the ocean), through one of the five elements (sky), met daughter of one of the five elements (daughter of earth - Sita Devi) burnt down Lanka by one of the five elements (fire). Sundara Kanda highlights the heroic exploits of Lord Hanuman at Lanka. \n\nBy many, it is considered auspicious to circle the Hanuman idol 5 times, 14 times, 23 times, 32 times or any amount in which the digits of which add to five. The pancha mukha hanuman is rare idol of Hanuman. There are many legends and interpretations of this. One of the legend is that Lord Hanuman appeared before Raghavendra Swami in a unique way amalgamating within him the avataras of \"varaha, garuda, anjaneya, narasimha and hayagreeva\", thus five-headed. \n\nPanchamukhi, located on the south bank of river Tungabhadra near Manchala now known as Mantralayam is where Raghavendra Swami performed penance for 12 long years in a cave. In appreciation of his Yoga, Lord Panchamukhi Pranadevaru, Kollahpura Mahalakshmi, Lord Venkateshwara of Tirupati and Kurmavathara gave him darshan. Then Raghavendra Swami left for Mantralaya where he entered into Samadhi. A temple, the Panchamukhi Anjaneyaswamy temple, was constructed on the spot where Raghavendra Swami performed penance.\n\nEast facing Anjaneya to grant Ishta Siddhi to humanity. South facing Karala Ugraveera Narasimha to grant Abhista Siddhi to humanity. West facing Mahaveera Garuda to grant Sakala Sowbhagya to humanity. North facing Lakshmi Varaha to grant Dhana Prapthi to humanity. Urdhva Mukha being Hayagriva to grant Sarva Vidya Jaya Prapthi to humanity.\n\nThe Five Ways of Praying to the Lord\n\nThese five ways are known as Naman, Smaran, Keerthanam, Yachanam and Arpanam. The five faces of Panchamukaa are each a depiction of one these five forms of worship. Lord Hanuman always used to Naman, Smaran and Keerthanam of Lord Sri Rama. He totally surrendered (Arpanam) to his Master Sri Ram. He also begged (yachanam) Sri Rama to bless him with undivided love.\nFrom the Bhagavat Gita\n\nIn the Bhagavat Gita, Lord Krishna tells Arjun, \"He who acts for me, who is engrossed in me, who is my devotee, who is free from attachment, he reaches me\". We find all these 5 qualities enshrined in Hanuman. Each of his faces represent these five divine qualifications. Maybe an artist thought over about this before making the Vigraham. There is a belief that one of the faces is that of Sri Vinayaka.\nHalf Ganesha and half Hanuman\nThe idol of Adyanta Maha Prabhu depicts a figure of half Anjaneya and half Vinayaka. At Madya Kailas temple Adyar Madras, the idol is an amalgam of Sri Vigneshwara and Sri Anjaneya in the style of Ardhanareeswara (Siva and Parvati) and Sri Sankaranarayana (a combination of Siva and Narayana). The word Aadiyantha stands for \"beginning to end\" (Aadi = beginning & Antha = end). There is a Tamil saying \"Begin with Ganesa and end up with Anjaneya\". Many people visit the temple to receive a blessing of the \"Twins\" against the influence of Navagrahas. The importance of the idol is that Sri Vigneswara and Sri Anjaneya are the only two deities who are totally free from any influence over them whatsoever by the Navagrahas. It is believed that, the devotees can and do influence the Navagrahas themselves proportionate to the devoutness with which the devotees address themselves to Sri Aadiyanta Prabhu!\n\nPanchmukhi Hanuman temple of Basatiyawala exists in Yamunanagar district of Haryana near Kalesar National Park.\n\nAs part of INR1200 crore Morni-Kalesar tourism development plan announced in January 2019, the Government of Haryana is developing this temple, along with Kalesar Mahadev temple, Kapal Mochan Tirth, Sharda Mata Temple of Chotta Trilokpur, Lohgarh fort capital of Banda Singh Bahadur.\n\n\n"}

This was done to reduce the size of the baggage train and increase the mobility of the army by allowing the soldiers to move strategically (i.e. quickly) independently of the train. Such was the load of the soldiers that they became known as \"Marius' Mules\".\n\nThe appearance of the marching pack is known from illustrations on Trajan's Column. Here it can be seen that a legionary's sarcina was carried on a pole called a \"furca\" and would have included:\n\n\nHowever, this was certainly not the limit of the soldiers load. Time and again, Roman writers emphasise the importance of soldiers being self-sufficient and not tied to the baggage train. \n\nThe 2nd-century historian Appian of Alexandria records the actions of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in late 3rd century BC. This was mainly with the objective of improving the morale of the soldiers, but it is also clear that the army is expected to be mobile:\n\nHe ordered all wagons and their superfluous contents to be sold, and all pack animals, except such as he designated, to remain. For cooking utensils it was permitted to have only a spit, a brass kettle, and one cup. Their food was limited to plain boiled and roasted meats. They were forbidden to have beds, and Scipio was the first one to sleep on straw. He forbade them to ride on mules when on the march; \"for what can you expect in a war,\" said he, \"from a man who is not able to walk?\" Those who had servants to bathe and anoint them were ridiculed by Scipio, who said that only mules, having no hands, needed others to rub them.\n\nThe 1st-century historian Josephus, recorded the items carried in his own time:\n\nbesides a saw and a basket, a pick-axe and an axe, a thong of leather and a hook, with provisions for three days, so that a footman hath no great need of a mule to carry his burdens. The Wars Of The Jews Book 3, chapter 7.\n\nThe 4th century writer Vegetius advises that:\n\nThe legion is provided with iron hooks, called wolves, and iron scythes fixed to the ends of long poles; and with forks, spades, shovels, pickaxes, wheelbarrows and baskets for digging and transporting earth; together with hatchets, axes and saws for cutting wood. De Re Militari Book II: The Organization of the Legion.\n\nVegetius was not clear that the soldiers were required to carry these items personally, but we know that soldiers were required to carry entrenching tools (such as the dolabra) and turf cutters for the construction of a temporary camp at the end of each day's march. Probably a variety of tools and equipment was carried distributed among the members of a contubernium. They may also have carried baskets and one or more sudes (stakes).\n\nThere have been many attempts to reconstruct the sarcina and its component parts for historical reenactment.\n\n"}
{"id": "2596183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2596183", "title": "Keling", "text": "Keling\n\nKeling () or Kling is a word used in parts of Southeast Asia to denote a person of the Indian subcontinent. This includes both those from India and overseas Indians. In modern colloquial usage it is commonly not capitalised. The term is used in the Malay Archipelago — specifically Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei — but cognates exist in neighbouring countries as well. Although the early definition was neutral and linked to the historical Kalinga kingdom of Eastern India, its use in later history came to be perceived as a derogatory term to refer to people of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia.\n\nThe word \"Keling\" derives from the ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga. While this was apparently sometimes localized as \"Kalingga\" (as in the Indonesian Kalingga Kingdom), the terminal schwa sound was dropped in common usage to form Keling. Though ostensibly denoting the Kalinga kingdom, the term Keling in ancient Southeast Asia came to be a more general term for India and its people. The Khmer word Kleng (ក្លិង្គ) and the Thai word \"Khaek\" (แขก) derived from the same root. Prior to the introduction of the English word \"India\", Keling and Jambu Dwipa were used to refer to the country in the Malay and Indonesian language, while \"Benua Keling\" referred to the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the word \"Keling\" appears in the in \"Sejarah Melayu\" (Malay Annals). The legend mentions Raja Shulan as the king of Keling who sets out to conquer China with his descendant Raja Chulan. Scholars identify Raja Chulan with the Chola king of India, from whom the term \"Chulia\" derives, as in Penang's Chulia Street. Later parts of the Sejarah Melayu mention the voyages of Hang Nadim and Hang Tuah to \"Benua Keling\" (India). However Keling must not be misunderstood as a specific territory, rather it refers to people of Indian origin and not only the inhabitants of Kalinga. For example, a colonial-era Indonesian tradition refers to the Ramayana epic as \"Rama Keling\" meaning \"Rama the Indian\". After the introduction of Islam, Keling sometimes referred specifically to Tamils or Telugu people while Gujaratis and Indo-Aryan peoples from Pakistan were often confused with \"Parsi\" or Persians.\n\nThe Dutch used the words \"Clings\" and \"Klingers\" to refer to the Indian inhabitants of Malacca. The British colonial writings also use the word \"Kling\" to describe the immigrants from Madras Presidency and Coromandel coast. John Crawfurd (1856) mentioned that the term \"Kling\" was used by the Malays and the Javanese as \"a general term for all the people of Hindustan (North India), and for the country India itself\".\n\nThe 16th-century Portuguese traveller Castanheda wrote of the Keling community in Melaka in the period between 1528-1538:\n\nIn its early usage Keling was a neutral term for people of Indian origin, but was perceived negatively beginning in the 20th century due to various socio-political factors. From the mid-1900s, words denoting ethnic origin were used derogatively in Malay to imply immigrant status. Consequently more neutral language was chosen for political correctness. This can be observed in the 1960 publication \"Cherita Jenaka\" in which the term \"orang Keling\" (Keling people) was changed to \"orang India\" (Indian people) in 1963.\n\nThe word \"Keling\" has been used variously within the Malay community to mean Indian, Tamil, or south Indian. The title \"Kapitan Keling\" was used for a representative of an Indian community, similar to the \"Kapitan Cina\" of a Chinese community. In early Penang of the 1790s the \"Kapitan Keling\" was Cauder Mohideen who, together with the Kapitan Cina Koh Lay Huan and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes. This usage is preserved is the name of the Kapitan Keling Mosque, a prominent Penang landmark.\n\nIn many modern cases \"Keling\" is used as a derogatory term. It was used in 2005 by Members of Parliament in Malaysia because of misconception about Indian ethnics, which resulted in an uproar accusing the MPs of racism.\n\nTraditionally in Java, Indonesia, Keling is linked with India while Kalingga refers to the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom, which ultimately derived from the Indian Kalinga kingdom. It can possibly have other meanings, such as \"ship\". Rivets used to connect metals are called \"paku keling\" or \"blunt nail\". in modern colloquial Indonesian, it is sometimes used to refer to any dark-skinned person, a stereotype of southern Indians, though this usage is considered offensive.\n\nIn Cambodia, the slang term for Indian people is \"Kleng\" (ក្លិង្គ), also derived from the kingdom of Kalinga and cognate with the Malay Keling or Kling. It may also be used as a nickname for people who have stereotypically Indian features such as big eyes and dark skin.\n\nThe equivalent of Keling in the Thai language is \"Khaek\" (แขก). It is a generic term referring to anyone from the Indian subcontinent. The term generally has no negative connotation and is used even in polite or formal communication. However, outside influence and confusion with Mughals and Indian Muslims has broadened the meaning in modern times to include certain predominantly Muslims communities, particularly Persians and Arabs. This extended meaning is considered inaccurate and at times rejected as derogatory, especially by Thai Muslims, but has become increasingly widespread.\n\nThe phrases \"Keling-a\" (Hokkien; 吉寧仔; POJ: \"Kiet-lêng-á\"), \"Keling-yan\" (Cantonese; 吉寧人; Yale: \"gat-lìhng-yan\"), and \"Keling-kia\" (Teochew) are frequently used within the Chinese community in Malaysia and Singapore. As with the Malay word these were not originally offensive today may be used in either a derogatory or non-derogatory manner: e.g., in Penang Hokkien, which is spoken by some Indians in Penang, \"Keling-a\" is the only word that exists to refer to ethnic Indians.\n\nThe Hokkien and Teochew suffixes \"-a\" and \"-kia\" are diminutives that are generally used to refer to non-Chinese ethnic groups, while \"-yan\" mean human.\n\nVarious place names in Malaysia contain the word Keling for historical reasons, e.g. Tanjong Keling., Kampong Keling, and Bukit Keling, etc.\n\nIn Penang, the Kapitan Keling Mosque, situated on the corner of Buckingham Street and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling (Pitt Street), is one of the oldest mosques in George Town. Various other Penang Hokkien street names contain the word \"Keling\", e.g. Kiet-leng-a Ban-san (Chowrasta Road), Kiet-leng-a Ke (King Street/Market Street).\n\nIn Singapore, there is a road in Jurong Industrial Estate called Tanjong Kling Road which is probably derived from the word 'Keling'.\n\nIn Jepara Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, there is a subdistrict called Keling. Locals link the location with the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom. In Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, there is a place called Pacar Keling meaning \"Keling lover\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2597119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2597119", "title": "Rye bread", "text": "Rye bread\n\nRye bread is a type of bread made with various proportions of flour from rye grain. It can be light or dark in color, depending on the type of flour used and the addition of coloring agents, and is typically denser than bread made from wheat flour. It is higher in fiber than white bread and is often darker in color and stronger in flavor. \n\nDark rye bread was considered a staple through the Middle Ages. Many different types of rye grain have come from north-central and western and eastern Europe such as Scandinavia, Finland, Baltic countries, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and is also a specialty in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. Around 500 AD, the Saxons and Danes settled in Britain and introduced rye, which was well suited to its temperate climates.\n\nWhile rye and wheat are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ enough that they affect the breadmaking process. The key issue is differing amylases, the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and pentosans. As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.\n\nThere are two common solutions: The traditional manner, developed where obtaining wheat was traditionally impractical because of marginal growing conditions or supply difficulties, uses dough acidification to impede the function of rye amylases. Lowering dough pH, however, compromises the use of relatively acid-intolerant \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"-based \"baker's yeast\". Instead, addition of naturally acidic \"Lactobacillus\" \"sourdough\" cultures lowers bread pH, facilitating growth of an acid-tolerant yeast strain, and helping gelatinize starches in the dough matrix. The byproduct of this approach is lighter breads.\n\nIn areas where high-gluten hard wheat is readily available, the need for a complex polyculture of bacteria and yeast can often be reduced or removed by adding a large proportion of hard wheat flour to the rye flour. Its added gluten compensates for amylase activity on the starch in the dough, allowing the bread to retain its structure as it bakes. The \"deli rye\" tradition in the United States is based upon this mixing of grains. Use of high-gluten wheat flour also makes possible multigrain breads, such as the \"rye and Indian\" bread of the American colonies, which combined rye and wheat with cornmeal in one loaf.\n\nRye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers.\n\nPure rye bread contains only rye flour, without any wheat. German-style pumpernickel, a dark, dense, and close-textured loaf, is made from crushed or ground whole rye grains, usually without wheat flour, baked for long periods at low temperature in a covered tin. Rye and wheat flours are often used to produce a rye bread with a lighter texture, color and flavor than pumpernickel. \"Light\" or \"dark\" rye flour can be used to make rye bread; the flour is classified according to the amount of bran left in the flour after milling. Caramel or molasses for coloring and caraway seeds are often added to rye bread. In the United States, breads labeled as \"rye\" nearly always contain caraway unless explicitly labeled as \"unseeded.\" In Canada (especially Montreal), breads labeled as \"rye\" often have no seeds, whereas breads labeled as \"kimmel\" are usually rye with caraway seeds. Some unique rye bread recipes include ground spices such as fennel, coriander, aniseed, cardamom, or citrus peel. In addition to caramel and molasses, ingredients such as coffee, cocoa, or toasted bread crumbs are sometimes used for both color and flavor in very dark breads like pumpernickels. The addition of caraway seeds to rye bread is to counter the bloating that can be caused by the high fiber content of rye. Caraway has well-known anti-flatulence properties; however, the association is so long-standing that the flavor combination is now almost inseparable.\n\nA simple, all-rye bread can be made using a sourdough starter and rye meal; it will not rise as high as a wheat bread, but will be moister with a substantially longer shelf life. Such bread is often known as \"black bread\" (\"Schwarzbrot\" in German, \"chyorniy khleb\" in Russian) from their darker color than wheat breads (enhanced by long baking times, creating Maillard reactions in the crumb). The German \"Vollkornbrot\" (whole-grain bread) is something of an archetypical example, containing both rye meal and cracked whole rye grains (which are generally soaked overnight before incorporating into the dough). It is used both as an appetizer substrate for such things as smoked fish and caviar and as a sandwich bread. A very similar, but darker, bread, German-style pumpernickel, has an even darker color derived from toasted leftover bread and other agents. Due to the density of the bread, the yeast in the starter is used at least as much for the fermentation character in the bread itself as it is for leavening. Danish \"rugbrød\" (rye bread), another archetypical example, is typically made with sour dough, with either straight rye flour or mixed with whole and/or cracked rye kernels. Any breads containing wheat flour are not considered \"rugbrød\", but \"white bread\". A variety of seeds, such as pumpkin, poppy and caraway, may be added for taste. \"Rugbrød\" is a staple lunch food, typically eaten topped with cold or warm fish and meats, cheese or any other cold cut.\n\nAs stated above, all-rye breads may have very long shelf life, measured in months rather than days, and are popular as storage rations for long boat trips and outdoors expeditions. Such breads are usually sliced very thin because of their density, sometimes only a few millimeters thick, and are sometimes sold sliced in this manner.\n\nIt is fairly common to combine rye with other grains and seeds. In southern Germany and Switzerland, for example, it is not uncommon to find a variant of \"Vollkornbrot\" with sunflower seeds instead of the rye seeds, and some traditional recipes also substitute whole wheat grains for the rye grains. In the colonial era in North America, particularly in the United States, it became common to mix rye and cornmeal in what was known as \"rye and Indian\" or, if wheat flour was added, \"thirded\" bread; the resulting bread, though less dense than a whole-rye bread, was still heavier than the more expensive wheat-only breads that later became commonplace.\n\nIn medieval Europe, a mixed rye and wheat bread known as \"maslin\" (or variants of the name) was the bread of the better-off peasants for hundreds of years, in contrast to the white manchet bread eaten by the rich, and the horsebread eaten by the poorer peasants, which was made of cheaper grains including oats, barley and pulses.\n\nWheat-rye breads, particularly light rye (sissel) and American pumpernickel, but also a combination known as \"marble rye\", are very closely associated with Jewish-American cuisine, particularly the delicatessen. The bulk of the flour is white wheat flour (often a less-refined form known as \"first clear\"), with a substantial portion of rye mixed in for color and flavor. The dough is often, but not necessarily, leavened, in whole or in part, with sourdough, but sometimes uses a small addition of citric acid or vinegar to achieve the lowered pH needed to neutralize the rye amylases; so-called \"Jewish rye\" is further seasoned with whole caraway seeds and glazed with an egg wash, and is traditionally associated with salted meats such as corned beef, pastrami, and (outside kosher circles) ham. High-gluten wheat flour can be used with rye flour to make a dough suitable for bagels, as well. Jewish-style American rye bread is sometimes referred to as \"corn rye\"; the term comes from the use of cornmeal as a coating and handling aid and does not necessarily imply the use of cornmeal within the dough itself as in rye and Indian.\n\nThe Jewish-American variety has Eastern European antecedents, including Russian-style brown bread, Polish-style rye bread and Riga-style rye bread. In Scandinavia, similar breads are made, some of which (in Swedish, called \"limpa\") also include sweeteners and/or citrus peel, as well as spices such as anise, fennel or cardamom, sometimes reserved for festive occasions.\n\nIn Canada, Winnipeg-style rye bread does not actually contain much, if any, rye flour. Instead, this Jewish- and Slavic-influenced bread is made from cracked rye or coarse rye meal, added to wheat flour. Winnipeg-style rye bread does not contain caraway seeds.\n\nThere are three different types of rye crisp bread: yeast fermented, sourdough fermented and cold bread crisp bread. Most of the crisp bread produced in Scandinavia is baked following three to four hours of fermentation. Sourdough crisp breads are used in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany and India. The third type of crisp bread is the so-called cold bread crisp bread, essentially a type of hardtack (known in Sweden particularly as \"knäckebröd\" and in Finland as \"näkkileipä\"), which is baked without the addition of any leavening. The dough gets the right texture from a foaming process, where air is incorporated into the cooled dough, which also leads to the sometimes-almost-white color of the finished bread, although not all types are light in color. Crisp bread owes its long shelf life to its very low water content (5–7%).\n\nOne of the largest producers of rye flatbreads, and one of the most prominent in overseas markets, is the Swedish-founded company Wasabröd.\n\nRye flour is sometimes used in chemically leavened quick bread recipes as well, either batter-type or dough-type (similar to Irish soda bread). In such cases, it can be used in similar applications as whole wheat flour, since an egg matrix often provides the bread structure rather than the grain's gluten.\n\nRye bread contains a large amount of fiber and a small amount of fat. Compared to some breads such as white bread, rye bread has a lower glycemic index, which means it causes a slower increase in blood sugar than white bread after being eaten. Nonetheless, it consists mostly of carbohydrates, making its glycemic load high.\n\n"}

Languages differ within this parameter, some languages such as Italian and Spanish have constant pro-drop, Finnish and Hebrew for example are partial pro-drop languages and Japanese and Tamil fall into the category of discourse or radical pro-drop languages. There are also languages such as English, German and Swedish that only allow pro-drop within very strict stylistic conditions. A pro-sentence is a kind of pro-form and is therefore anaphoric.\n\nIn English, \"yes\", \"no\", \"okay\" and \"amen\" are common pro-sentences. In response to the question \"Does Mars have two moons?\", the sentence \"Yes\" can be understood to abbreviate \"Mars has two moons.\"\n\nPro-sentences are sometimes seen as grammatical interjections, since they are capable of very limited syntactical relations. But they can also be classified as a distinct part of speech, given that (other) interjections have meanings of their own and are often described as expressions of feelings or emotions.\n\nIn some languages, the equivalents to \"yes\" and \"no\" may substitute not only a whole sentence, but also a part of it, either the subject and the verb, or the verb and a complement, and can also constitute a subordinate clause.\n\nThe Portuguese word \"sim\" (\"yes\") gives a good example:\n\nIn some languages, such as English, \"yes\" rebuts a negative question, whereas \"no\" affirms it. However, in Japanese, the equivalents of \"no\" (\"iie\", \"uun\", \"(i)ya\") rebut a negative question, whereas the equivalents of \"yes\" (\"hai\", \"ee\", \"un\") affirm it.\n\nSome languages have a specific word that rebuts a negative question. German has \"\"doch\"\"; French has \"\"si\"\"; Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish have \"jo\", Hungarian has \"\"de\"\". None have a clear English translation.\n\nThe prosentential theory of truth developed by Dorothy Grover, Nuel Belnap, and Joseph Camp, and defended more recently by Robert Brandom, holds that sentences like \"\"p\" is true\" and \"It is true that p\" should not be understood as ascribing properties to the sentence \"p\", but as a pro-sentence whose content is the same as that of \"p.\" Brandom calls \" . . .is true\" a pro-sentence-forming operator.\n\n3.

The actual composition of the spice mix can vary from family to family, vendor to vendor though there are common ingredients, such as sesame, coriander, cumin, salt and black pepper. Reference to a 19th-century text lists marjoram, mint, zaatar and chickpeas as further ingredients that can be used in the mixture.

It is classified as a type of \"siu mei\" (), Cantonese roasted meat.\n\nPork cuts used for \"char siu\" can vary, but a few main cuts are common:\n\n\n\"Char siu\" literally means \"fork roasted\" (\"siu\" being burn/roast and \"cha\" being fork, both noun and verb) after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire.\n\nIn ancient times, wild boar and other available meats were used to make \"char siu\". However, in modern times, the meat is typically a shoulder cut of domestic pork, seasoned with a mixture of honey, five-spice powder, red fermented bean curd, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce, red food colouring (not a traditional ingredient but very common in today's preparations and is optional), and sherry or rice wine (optional). These seasonings turn the exterior layer of the meat dark red, similar to the \"smoke ring\" of American barbecues. Maltose may be used to give char siu its characteristic shiny glaze.\n\n\"Char siu\" is typically consumed with a staple, whether inside a bun (\"chasiu baau\", 叉燒包), with noodles (\"chasiu min\", 叉燒麵), or with rice (\"chasiu faan\", 叉燒飯) in fast food establishments, or served alone as a centerpiece or main dish in traditional family dining establishments. If it is purchased outside of a restaurant, it is usually taken home and used as one ingredient in various complex entrees consumed at family meals.\n\nIn Hong Kong, \"char siu\" is usually purchased from a \"siu mei\" establishment, which specializes in meat dishes—\"char siu\" pork, soy sauce chicken, white cut chicken, roasted goose, roasted pork, etc. These shops usually display the merchandise by hanging them in the window. As a result, \"char siu\" is often consumed alongside one of these other meat dishes when eaten as an independent lunch item on a per-person basis in a \"rice box\" meal. More commonly it is purchased whole or sliced and wrapped and taken home to be used in family meals either by itself or cooked into one of many vegetable or meat dishes which use \"char siu\" pork as an ingredient.\n\nIn Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, \"char siew\" rice is found in many Chinese \"shāolà\" (烧腊) stalls along with roast duck and roast pork. The dish consists of slices of \"char siu\", cucumbers, white rice and is drenched in sweet gravy or drizzled with dark soy sauce. \"Char siu\" rice is also a popular food within the Chinese community in Medan, Indonesia, where it is more called \"char sio\". \"Char siew\" rice can also be found in Hainanese chicken rice stalls, where customers have a choice of having their \"char siu\" rice served with plain white rice or chicken-flavoured rice, and choose from garlic, chilli and soy sauces. \"Char siu\" is called \"mu daeng\" (, , \"red pork\") in Thailand.\n\nIn the Philippines, it is known as Chinese \"Asado\" and usually eaten with cold cuts or served stuffed in \"siopao\". In Flanders and Holland it's known by the Indonesian name 'babi panggang'.\n\nVegetarian \"char siu\" also exists, usually made from wheat gluten. It can be found in vegetarian restaurants and stalls in South East Asian Chinese communities.\n\nJapanese culture has adapted 叉燒 as \"chāshū\" (チャーシュー). Unlike its Chinese variant, it is prepared by rolling the meat into a log and then braising it at a low temperature. The Japanese adaptation is typically seasoned with honey and soy sauce, without the red food colouring, sugar, or five-spice powder. It is a typical ingredient in \"rāmen\".\n\nAs a means of exceptional flavor and preparation, \"char siu\" applications extend beyond pork. In Hawaii, various meats are cooked \"char siu\" style. The term \"char siu\" refers to meats which have been marinated in \"char siu\" seasoning prepared either from scratch or from store-bought \"char siu\" seasoning packages, then roasted in an oven or over a fire. Ingredients in marinades for \"cha siu\" are similar to those found in China (honey, five-spice, wine, soy, hoisin, etc.), except that red food coloring is often used in place of the red bean curd for convenience. \"Char siu\" is used to marinate and prepare a variety of meats which can either be cooked in a conventional or convection oven (often not requiring the use of a fork or \"cha(zi)\" as traditional Chinese ovens do), on a standard barbecue, or even in an underground Hawaiian \"imu\". In Hawaii, \"char siu\" chicken is as common as \"char siu\" pork, and various wild birds, mountain goat, and wild boar are also often cooked \"char siu\" style, as are many sausages and skewers.\n\n"}

Today, military chocolate is issued to troops as part of basic field rations and sundry packs. Chocolate rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration. Military chocolate rations are often made in special lots to military specifications for weight, size, and endurance. The majority of chocolate issued to military personnel is produced by the Hershey Company.\n\nWhen provided as a morale boost or care package, military chocolate is often no different from normal store-bought bars in taste and composition. However, they are frequently packaged or molded differently. The World War II K ration issued in temperate climates sometimes included a bar of Hershey's commercial-formula sweet chocolate. But instead of being the typical flat thin bar, the K ration chocolate was a thick rectangular bar that was square at each end (in tropical regions, the K ration used Hershey's Tropical Bar formula).\n\nWhen provided as an emergency field ration, military chocolate was very different from normal bars. Since its intended use was as an emergency food source, it was formulated so that it would not be a tempting treat that troops might consume before they needed it. Even as attempts to improve the flavor were made, the heat-resistant chocolate bars never received rave reviews. Emergency ration chocolate bars were made to be high in energy value, easy to carry, and able to withstand high temperatures. Withstanding high temperatures was critical since infantrymen would often be outdoors, sometimes in tropical or desert conditions, with the bars located close to their bodies. These conditions would cause typical chocolate bars to melt within minutes.\n\nThe first emergency chocolate ration bar commissioned by the United States Army was the Ration D, commonly known as the D ration. Army Quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan approached Hershey's Chocolate in April 1937, and met with William Murrie, the company president, and Sam Hinkle, the chief chemist. Milton Hershey was extremely interested in the project when he was informed of the proposal, and the meeting began the first experimental production of the D ration bar.\n\nColonel Logan had four requirements for the D ration Bar. The bar must:\n\n\nIts ingredients were chocolate, sugar, oat flour, cacao fat, skim milk powder, and artificial flavoring. Chocolate manufacturing equipment was built to move the flowing mixture of liquid chocolate and oat flour into preset molds. However, the temperature-resistant formula of chocolate became a gooey paste that would not flow at any temperature.\n\nChief chemist Hinkle was forced to develop entirely new production methods to produce the bars. Each four-ounce portion had to be kneaded, weighed, and pressed into a mold by hand. The end result was an extremely hard block of dark brown chocolate that would crumble with some effort and was heat-resistant to .\n\nThe resultant bar was wrapped in aluminum foil. Three bars sealed in a parchment packet made up a daily ration and was intended to furnish the individual combat soldier with the minimum sustenance recommended each day.\n\nLogan was pleased with the first small batch of samples. In June 1937, the United States Army ordered 90,000 D ration or \"Logan Bars\" and field tested them at bases in the Philippines, Panama, on the Texas border, and at other bases throughout the United States. Some of the bars even found their way into the supplies for Admiral Byrd's third Antarctic expedition. These field tests were successful, and the Army began making irregular orders for the bars.\n\nWith the onset of America's involvement in World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the bars were ordered to be packaged to make them poison gas proof. The 4-ounce (112 g) bars' boxes were covered with an anti-gas coating and were packed 12 to a cardboard carton, which was also coated. These cartons were packed 12 to a wooden crate for a total of 144 bars to a crate.\n\nThe D ration was almost universally detested for its bitter taste by U.S. troops, and was often discarded instead of consumed when issued. Troops called the D ration \"Hitler's Secret Weapon\" for its effect on soldiers' intestinal tracts. It could not be eaten at all by soldiers with poor dentition, and even those with good dental work often found it necessary to first shave slices off the bar with a knife before consuming.\n\nDuring the war years, the bulk of the Hershey Food Corporation's chocolate production was for the military. Between 1940 and 1945, an estimated 3 billion units of the specially formulated candy bars were distributed to soldiers around the world.\" This chocolate ration was part of a larger scale of rationed foodstuffs. The ideology of food, as seen by U.S. propaganda director Elmer Davis, is suggested to be \"a profoundly political matter during the Second World War. As global famine conditions and national rationing programs came to define the daily lives of most people, agriculture and eating became fraught emblems of military power, war trade, and political allegiances.\"\n\nIn 1943, the Procurement Division of the Army approached Hershey about producing a confectionery-style chocolate bar with improved flavor that would still withstand extreme heat for issue in the Pacific Theater. After a short period of experimentation, the Hershey company began producing Hershey's Tropical Bar. The bar was designed for issue with field and specialty rations, such as the K ration, and originally came in 1-ounce (28 g) and 2-ounce (56 g) sizes. After 1945, it came in 4-ounce (112 g) D ration sizes as well.\n\nThe Tropical Bar (it was called the D ration throughout the war, despite its new appellation) had more of a resemblance to normal chocolate bars in its shape and flavor than the original D ration, which it gradually replaced by 1945. While attempts to sweeten its flavor were somewhat successful, nearly all U.S. soldiers found the Tropical Bar tough to chew and unappetizing; reports from countless memoirs and field reports are almost uniformly negative. Instead, the bar was either discarded or traded to unsuspecting Allied troops or civilians for more appetizing foods or goods. Resistance to accepting the ration soon appeared among the latter groups after the first few trades. In the Burma theater of war (CBI), the D ration or Tropical Bar did make one group of converts: it was known as the \"dysentery ration\", since the bar was the only ration those ill with dysentery could tolerate.\n\nIn 1957, the bar's formula was changed to make it more appetizing. The unpopular oat flour was removed, non-fat milk solids replaced skim milk powder, cocoa powder replaced cacao fat, and artificial vanilla flavoring was added. It was added with the help of sugar. It greatly improved the flavor of the bar, but it was still difficult to chew.\n\nIt is estimated that between 1940 and 1945, over 3 billion of the D ration and Tropical Bars were produced and distributed to soldiers throughout the world. In 1939, the Hershey plant was capable of producing 100,000 ration bars a day. By the end of World War II, the entire Hershey plant was producing ration bars at a rate of 24 million a week. For their service throughout World War II, the Hershey Chocolate Company was issued the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award for Excellence for exceeding expectations for quality and quantity in the production of the D ration and the Tropical Bar. Their continued efforts resulted in four stars being added to their pennant signifying the five times they received this distinction. U.S. propaganda used this product distinction during the war as a message \"that Allied nations would win the war because of their democratic institutions, but also because of the productivity of the U.S. economy and, especially, its agriculture.\" In tandem with this state-sponsored rhetoric, radio advertisements for foodstuffs and other consumer goods employed wartime slogans to reinforce military campaigns against Germany and Japan.\n\nThe rhetoric of \"war rations aligned food consumption with the war in Europe and Asia but also with the vitality of U.S. agriculture and consumerism. While these campaigns aimed to conserve U.S. food surpluses for the purpose of providing food aid to overseas militaries and civilian populations, they also functioned to jettison certain foodstuffs.\" Production of the D ration bar was discontinued at the end of World War II. However, Hershey's Tropical Bar remained a standard ration for the United States Armed Forces. The Tropical Bar saw action in Korea and Vietnam as an element of the \"Sundries\" kit (which also contained toiletries), before being declared obsolete. It briefly returned to use when it was included onboard Apollo 15 in July 1971.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the US Army's Natick Labs created a new high-temperature chocolate (dubbed the \"Congo Bar\" by researchers) that could withstand heat in excess of .\n\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, Hershey's Chocolate was the major manufacturer, shipping 144,000 bars to American troops in the southwest Asia theater. While Army spokesmen said the bar's taste was good, troop reactions were mixed and the bar was not put into full production.\n\nSince the war ended before Hershey's supplies of the experimental bar were shipped, the remainder of the production run was packaged in a \"desert camo\" wrapper and was dubbed the \"Desert Bar\". It proved a brief novelty but Hershey declined to make more after supplies ran out.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2625642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2625642", "title": "Kokutai", "text": "Kokutai\n\n\"Kokutai\" originated as a Sino-Japanese loanword from Chinese \"guoti\" (; \"state political system; national governmental structure\"). The Japanese compound word joins and . According to the \"Hanyu Da Cidian\", the oldest \"guoti\" usages are in two Chinese classic texts. The 2nd century BCE \"Guliang zhuan\" () to the Spring and Autumn Annals glosses \"dafu\" () as \"guoti\" metaphorically meaning \"embodiment of the country\". The 1st century CE Book of Han history of Emperor Cheng of Han used \"guoti\" to mean \"laws and governance\" of Confucianist officials.\n\nThe historical origins of \"kokutai\" go back to pre-1868 periods, especially the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868).\n\nAizawa Seishisai (会沢正志斎, 1782–1863) was an authority on Neo-Confucianism and leader of the Mitogaku (水戸学 \"Mito School\") that supported direct restoration of the Imperial House of Japan. He popularized the word \"kokutai\" in his 1825 \"Shinron\" (新論 \"New Theses\"), which also introduced the term \"Sonnō jōi\" (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\").\n\nAizawa developed his ideas of \"kokutai\" using the scholarly arguments of Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) that the Japanese national myths in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" were historical facts, believing that the Emperor was directly descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu-ōmikami. Aizawa idealized this divinely-ruled ancient Japan as a form of \"saisei itchi\" (祭政一致 \"unity of religion and government\") or theocracy. For early Japanese Neo-Confucian scholars, linguist Roy Andrew Miller (1982:93) says, \"\"kokutai\" meant something still rather vague and ill defined. It was more or less the Japanese \"nation's body\" or \"national structure\".\n\nKatō Hiroyuki (1836–1916) and Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835–1901) were Meiji period scholars who analyzed the dominance of Western civilization and urged progress for the Japanese nation.\n\nIn 1874, Katō wrote the \"Kokutai Shinron\" (国体新論 \"New Theory of the National Body/Structure\"), which criticized traditional Chinese and Japanese theories of government and, adopting Western theories of natural rights, proposed a constitutional monarchy for Japan. He contrasted between \"kokutai\" and \"seitai\" (政体 \"government body/structure\"). Brownlee explains.\nThe \"Kokutai-seitai\" distinction enabled conservatives to identify clearly as \"Kokutai\", National Essence, the \"native Japanese\", eternal, and immutable aspects of their polity, derived from history, tradition, and custom, and focused on the Emperor. The form of government, \"Seitai\", a secondary concept, then consisted of the historical arrangements for the exercise of political authority. \"Seitai\", the form of government, was historically contingent and changed through time. Japan had experienced in succession direct rule by the Emperors in ancient times, then the rule of the Fujiwara Regents, then seven hundred years of rule by \"shōguns\", followed by the allegedly direct rule of the Emperors again after the Meiji Restoration. Each was a \"seitai\", a form of government. In this understanding, the modern system of government under the Meiji Constitution, derived this time from foreign sources, was nothing more than another form of Japanese government, a new \"seitai\". The Constitution was nothing fundamental. (2000:5) \n\nFukuzawa Yukichi was an influential author translator for the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860). His 1875 \"Bunmeiron no Gairyaku\" (文明論の概略 \"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization\") contradicted traditional ideas about \"kokutai\". He reasoned that it was not unique to Japan and that every nation could be said to have a \"kokutai\" \"national sovereignty\". While Fukuzawa respected the Emperor of Japan, he believed \"kokutai\" did not depend upon myths of unbroken descent from Amaterasu.\n\nThe Constitution of the Empire of Japan of 1889 created a form of constitutional monarchy with the \"kokutai\" sovereign emperor and \"seitai\" organs of government. Article 4 declares that \"the Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty\", uniting the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, although subject to the \"consent of the Imperial Diet\". This system utilized a democratic form, but in practice was closer to an absolute monarchy. The legal scholar Josefa López notes that under the Meiji Constitution, \"kokutai\" acquired an additional meaning.\n\nThis stemmed from Itō Hirobumi's rejection of some European notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity. The references to the \"kokutai\" were the justification of the emperor's authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign. The \"family-state\" element in it was given a great deal of prominence by political philosophy. Many conservatives supported these principles as central to \"Nihon shugi\" (\"Nihon gunkoku shugi\", Japanese militarism), \"Japanism\", as an alternative to rapid Westernization.\n\nFrom the Xinhai Revolution to the enactment of the Peace Preservation Law (1911–1925), the most important pre-World War II democracy movement \"Taishō Democracy\" occurred. During the Taishō Democracy, the political theorist Sakuzō Yoshino (1878–1933) rejected Western democracy \"minshu shugi\" (民主主義 lit. \"people rule principle/-ism\") and proposed a compromise on imperial democracy \"minpon shugi\" (民本主義 \"people based principle/-ism\"). However, as Japanese nationalism grew, questions arose whether the \"kokutai\" emperor could be limited by the \"seitai\" government.\n\nThe Peace Preservation Law of 1925 forbade both forming and belonging to any organization that proposed altering the \"kokutai\" or the abolishment of private property, effectively criminalizing socialism, communism, republicanism, democracy and other anti-Tenno ideologies. The Tokkō (\"Special Higher Police\") was established as a type of Thought Police to investigate political groups that might threaten Tenno-centered social order of Japan.\n\nTatsukichi Minobe (1873–1948), a professor emeritus of law at Tokyo Imperial University, theorized that under the Meiji Constitution, the emperor was an organ of the state and not a sacrosanct power beyond the state. This was regarded as \"lèse-majesté\". Minobe was appointed to the House of Peers in 1932 but forced to resign after an assassination attempt and vehement criticisms that he was disloyal to the emperor.\n\nGreat efforts were made to foment a \"Japanese spirit\" even in popular culture, as in the promotion of the \"Song of Young Japan.\"\n\nThe national debates over \"kokutai\" led the Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe to appoint a committee of Japan's leading professors to deliberate the matter. In 1937, they issued the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" (国体の本義, \"Cardinal Principles of the National Body/Structure,\" see Gauntlett and Hall 1949). Miller gives this description.\nThe document known as the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" was actually a pamphlet of 156 pages, an official publication of the Japanese Ministry of Education, first issued in March 1937 and eventually circulated in millions of copies throughout the home islands and the empire. It contained the official teaching of the Japanese state on every aspect of domestic policy, international affairs, culture, and civilization. (1982:92)\n\nIt clearly stated its purpose: to overcome social unrest and to develop a new Japan. From this pamphlet, pupils were taught to put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it. It also instructed them in the principle of hakkō ichiu, which would be used to justify imperialism.\n\nBrownlee concludes that after the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" proclamation,\nIt is clear that at this stage in history, they were no longer dealing with a concept to generate spiritual unity like Aizawa Seishisai in 1825, or with a political theory of Japan designed to accommodate modern institutions of government, like the Meiji Constitution. The committee of professors from prestigious universities sought to define the essential truths of Japan, which might be termed religious, or even metaphysical, because they required faith at the expense of logic and reason. (2006:13) \n\nThe Ministry of Education promulgated it throughout the school system.\n\nBy 1937, \"election purification\", originally aimed at corruption, required that no candidate set the people in opposition to either the military or the bureaucracy. This was required because voters were required to support imperial rule.\n\nSome objections to the founding of the \"Taisei Yokusankai\" or Imperial Rule Assistance Association, came on the grounds that \"kokutai\", already required all imperial subjects to support imperial rule.\n\nFor the leaders of Japan's \"fascist-nationalist clique\", writes Miller (1982:93), \"\"kokutai\" had become a convenient term for indicating all the ways in which they believed that the Japanese nation, as a political as well as a racial entity, was simultaneously different from and superior to all other nations on earth.\"\n\nThis term, and what it meant, were widely inculcated in propaganda. The final letters of kamikaze pilots expressed, above all, that their motivations were gratitude to Japan and to its Emperor as the embodiment of \"kokutai\". A sailor might give his life to save the picture of the Emperor on a submarine.\n\nDuring World War II, intellectuals at an \"overcoming modernity\" conference proclaimed that prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been a classless society under a benevolent emperor, but the restoration had plunged the nation into Western materialism (an argument that ignored commercialism and ribald culture in the Tokugawa era), which had caused people to forget their nature, which the war would enable them to reclaim.\n\n\"Japanist\" unions endeavoured to win support by disavowing violence and pledging support for nation and emperor. Nevertheless, because of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with \"councils\" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict. Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity.\n\nBecause many religions had figures that distracted from the central emperor, they were attacked, such as the Oomoto sect condemned for worshipping figures other than Amaterasu, and in 1939, the Religious Organization authorized the shutting down of any religion that did not conform to the Imperial Way, which the authorities promptly used.\n\nHirohito evoked the \"Kokutai\" in the Jewel Voice Broadcast, which announced the Japanese acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration (unconditional surrender).\n\nBy the surrender of Japan in 1945, the significance of \"kokutai\" diminished. In autumn 1945, GHQ forbade circulation of the \"Kokutai no Hongi\" and repealed the Peace Preservation Law (15 October 1945). By enact of the Constitution of the State of Japan (3 May 1947), Tenno's sovereignty and the \"lèse-majesté\" were repealed.\n\nNevertheless, some authors, including Miller (1982:95), believe that traces of Japanese \"kokutai\" \"are quite as vivid today as they ever were\".\n\nIn the 21st century, Japanese nationalists, such as those affiliated with the Nippon Kaigi lobby, have begun using the phrase \"kunigara\" (国柄).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2625873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2625873", "title": "Isleño", "text": "Isleño\n\nIsleño (Spanish: , pl. \"isleños\") is the Spanish word meaning \"islander.\" The term was applied to the Canary Islanders to distinguish them from Spanish mainlanders known as \"peninsulars\" (). The \"Isleños\" are the inhabitants of the Canary Islands, and by extension the descendants of Canarian settlers and emigrants to present-day Louisiana, Texas, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Americas. In these places, the name, which formerly referred to a general category of people, now refers to the specific cultural identity of Canary Islanders or their descendants throughout Latin America and in Louisiana, where they are still called \"isleños\". Another name for Canary Islander in English is \"Canarian.\" In Spanish, an alternative is \"canario\" or \"isleño canario\".\n\nThe term \"isleño\" is still used in Latin America, at least in those countries which had large Canarian populations, to distinguish a Canary Islander from a \"peninsular\" (continental Spaniard). By the early 19th century there were more people of Canarian extraction in the Americas than in the Canary Islands themselves, and the number of descendants of those first immigrants is exponentially larger than the number who originally migrated. The Americas were the destination of most Canarian immigrants, from their discovery by Europeans in the 15th century until the 20th century, when substantial numbers went to the Spanish colonies of Ifni, Western Sahara and Equatorial Guinea in Africa during the first half of the century. Beginning in the 1970s, they began to emigrate to other European countries, although emigration to the Americas did not end until the early 1980s.\n\nThe cultures of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Uruguay partially have all been influenced by Canarian culture, as have the dialects of Spanish spoken in all but Uruguay. Although almost all descendants of Canary Islanders who emigrated to the Americas from the 16th to the 20th century are incorporated socially and culturally within the larger populations, there remain a few communities that have preserved at least some of their ancestors' Canarian culture, as in Louisiana, San Antonio in Texas, Hatillo, Puerto Rico, San Carlos de Tenerife (now a neighborhood of Santo Domingo) in the Dominican Republic and San Borondón in Peru.\n\nThe Canary Islander emigration to the Americas began as early as 1492, with the first voyage of Columbus, and did not end until the early 1980s. The Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands (probably first visited by the Phoenicians and rediscovered by Europeans in the 14th century) had only recently occurred (1402–1496), when Columbus made a stopover in the Canary Islands for supplies in 1501. Also in 1501 (possibly 1502), Nicolás de Ovando left the Canary Islands with a group of people heading to the island of Hispaniola. In the early 16th century, some Guanches from the Canary Islands were exported as slaves to Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo, a practice that continued as late as 1534.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors, some of whom settled permanently in the Americas themselves, organized several groups of people chosen in the Canary Islands to colonize parts of Latin America including Mexico, Buenos Aires, Peru, New Granada and La Florida. There followed other groups who settled in Santo Domingo and Cuba in the second half of 16th century. In 1611, about 10 Canarian families were sent to Santiago del Prado, Cuba, and by the Royal Decree of May 6, 1663, 800 Canarian families were sent to settle in Santo Domingo; it is assumed this was to avert the danger that the French might seize it, since they already had occupied what is now Haiti.\n\nIn 1678, the Spanish crown enacted the so-called \"Tributo de Sangre\" (Blood Tribute); this was a Spanish law stipulating that for every thousand tons of cargo shipped from Spanish America to Spain, 50 Canarian families would be sent to the Americas to populate regions having low populations of \"Peninsulares\", or Spanish-born Spaniards. Consequently, during the late 17th and 18th century, hundreds of Canarian families moved to Venezuela, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, with others going to places like Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina or the south of the present United States. These families were sent to populate various parts of Latin America.\n\nThe \"Tributo de Sangre\" was finally abolished in 1764. Despite that, many Canarians continued to migrate to the Americas to escape grinding poverty at home. After the liberation of the Latin American countries from Spanish rule (1811–1825), Spain retained only Cuba and Puerto Rico as colonies in the Americas. It abolished slavery in those colonies, and encouraged Canarian emigration. Most Canarian immigrants then emigrated to the two islands in the Caribbean, where their labor was exploited and they were paid very little. There were, however, also thousands of Canarians who emigrated to other countries including Venezuela, Uruguay and Argentina. After the annexation of Cuba and Puerto Rico to the United States and the prohibition of Canarian emigration to Puerto Rico in 1898, emigration was directed primarily to Cuba, with certain flows to other countries (especially Argentina and Uruguay). After 1936, most Canarian immigrants went to Cuba and Venezuela until 1948, when an most of the islanders began emigrating to Venezuela. Since the 1970s Canarian emigration has decreased and from the early 1980s, with the improvement of the Canary Islands' economy (and Spain's in general, until the economic crisis of 2008), Canarian emigration has diminished.\n\nAfter a century and a half of growth, the economy of the Canary Islands was in crisis. The diminished output of \"vidueño canario\" (an internationally-traded white table wine) after the 1640 emancipation from Spanish rule of Portugal, whose colonies were its preferred market, put thousands of Canarians out of work, causing many of them to emigrate to the Americas with their families. There was discussion in governmental circles of the islands being overpopulated, and the Spanish crown decided to institute the \"El Tributo de Sangre (the tribute of blood). For each ton of cargo that a Spanish colony in the Americas sent to Spain, five Canarian families would be sent there. The number of families actually sent, however, usually exceeded ten.\n\nThe occupation of Jamaica by the English and of the western half of Santo Domingo and the Guianas by the French made the Spanish Crown consider want to avoid the occupation of part of Venezuela and the Greater Antilles. Commerce in cochineal dye expanded in the Canary Islands during the 19th century well into the 1880s, when trade in this product plummeted, which, together with the coffee boom and the war crisis in Cuba, depressed the economy. It also spurred Canarian emigration to the Americas. After 1893, Canarians continued to emigrate to Venezuela to escape Spanish military service.\n\nDuring the Ten Years' War (1868–1878) in Cuba, Cuban separatists made a distinction between Canary Islander immigrants and those from peninsular Spain, leading them to promote Canarian immigration to Cuba. The usual form of administration to manage the emigration from the islands prevailed, with corruption and fraud governing the actions of the Canarian ruling classes. In the 20th century poverty, the Spanish Civil War, and the actions of the Franco regime in Spain also drove Canarian emigration to the Americas.\n\nFor the reasons already mentioned, there were specific problems on some islands that also boosted Canarian emigration. In Lanzarote, from the 16th to the 20th century, the people experienced terrible drought (1626–1632), epidemics, house and tithe taxes, invasions of locusts, and several volcanic eruptions in 1730, affecting over half the population, causing many of them to migrate), pirate attacks (Lanzarote suffered more pirate invasions than the other islands) and harsh weather conditions. Consequently, many people on Lanzarote migrated to other Canary Islands including (Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura) as well as to the Americas, including Uruguay, Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela and the southern United States.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Spanish crown sent several groups of Canary Islanders to their colonies in New Spain. Spain's goal was to colonise certain regions with Spanish settlers, and between 1731 and 1783, several Canarian communities were established in what is now the Southern United States. In 1731, 16 Canarian families arrived in San Antonio, Spanish Texas. Between 1757 and 1759, 154 families were sent to Spanish Florida. Between 1778 and 1783 another 2,100 Canarians arrived in Spanish Louisiana. In southern Louisiana, the Canarians founded four communities in St. Bernard Parish, Valenzuela, Barataria, and Galveztown.\n\nThe Isleños fought in the American Revolutionary War and the Battle of the Alamo. After the incorporation of Louisiana and Texas into the United States, they fought in the Civil War and both World Wars. The Isleños have been able to preserve some features of their culture except in Florida, where they had made improvements in its agriculture, but most of the Canarian settlers emigrated to Cuba when Florida was ceded to Great Britain in 1763 and still more left when, after being recovered by Spain, Florida was ceded to the United States in 1819. The dialect of Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands during the 18th century was still spoken by older Isleños until the 1950s in San Antonio and is now spoken by a few in St. Bernard Parish.\n\nLouisiana's Isleños have shared some aspects of Canarian culture for over 200 years with the Cuban, Puerto Rican and Dominican peoples in those Caribbean countries influenced by earlier waves of settlers from the Canary Islands, who first arrived in the Americas in the late 16th century.\n\nOf the Latin American countries, Cuba was most affected by the immigration of Canary Islanders, and their presence influenced the development of the Cuban dialect and accent. Many words in traditional Cuban Spanish can be traced to the dialect spoken in the Canary Islands. Cuban Spanish is very close to Canarian Spanish, as Canarians have been emigrating to Cuba since the 16th century, especially during the 19th and (early) 20th centuries.\n\nThrough cross-emigration by Canarians and Cubans, many Canarian customs have become Cuban traditions and vice versa. Cuban music has been integrated into Canarian culture as well, including \"mambo\", \"son\", and \"punto Cubano\". Cuban emigration to the Canary Islands has introduced, for example, the dish \"moros y cristianos\" (or simply \"moros\"), to the cuisine of the Canary Islands; especially on the island of La Palma. Canary Islanders were the driving force in the cigar industry in Cuba, where they were called \"Vegueros.\" Many of the big cigar factories in Cuba were owned by Canary Islanders. After the Castro revolution, many Cubans and returning Canarians settled in the Canary Islands, among them cigar factory owners such as the Garcias. Through them the cigar industry made its way to the Canary Islands from Cuba, and it is now well-established there. The island of La Palma has had the most Cuban influence out of the seven islands, and its accent is the closest of the island accents to the Cuban accent.\n\nMany of the typical Cuban variations of standard Spanish vocabulary derive from the Canarian lexicon. For example, the word \"\"guagua\"\" (bus) differs from the standard Spanish \"autobús\"; the former originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeic word imitative of the sound of a Klaxon horn (wah-wah). The term of endearment \"socio\" is from the Canary Islands. An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb \"fajarse\" (to fight). In standard Spanish the verb would be \"pelearse\", while \"fajar\" exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt. The Cuban dialect of Spanish shows a substantial influence of the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands.\n\nMany names for food items come from the Canary Islands as well. The Cuban sauce \"mojo\" is based on the \"mojos\" of the Canary Islands, where the sauce was invented. Canarian \"ropa vieja\" was introduced to Cuba through Canarian emigration. \"Gofio\" is another Canarian food known to Cubans, along with many others.\n\nBetween 1678 and 1764 the Spanish policy of \"tributo de sangre\" stated that for every ton of cargo shipped from the Spanish colonies in the Americas to Spain, five Canarian families were sent to populate the colonies. The number of families sent to the Americas, however, often became ten. The first wave of Canarian emigration seems to have occurred in 1695 when Juan Fernández Franco de Medina, the new Governor of Puerto Rico, arrived with 20 Canarian families. This was followed by others in 1714, 1720, 1731, and 1797. Between 1720 and 1730, some 176 Canarian families, totaling 882 persons, emigrated to Puerto Rico, more than half of them married couples and their children, and the rest eventually found partners in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe \"tributo de sangre\" ended in 1764, but poverty and overpopulation in the Canary Islands still caused many Canarians to emigrate to Puerto Rico and other parts of Latin America. After the Spanish American colonies won their independence (1811–1825), most Canarian immigrants went to Cuba and Puerto Rico, the only remaining Spanish possessions in the Americas, where their labor was exploited to replace that of slaves, who had been liberated with the abolishment of slavery. Following the Spanish–American War of 1898, Canarian immigration to the Americas continued. Successive waves of Canary Island immigration came to Puerto Rico, and entire villages were formed of relocated islanders.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1895, Canary emigration to Puerto Rico was officially over 600 immigrants; if unrecorded or concealed immigration were taken into account, the number would be much larger. Canarian emigration to Puerto Rico in the 19th century is estimated at 2,733 people, mostly peasants desiring to farm their own land, who tended to settle in Puerto Rico in families or groups of families related to each other.\n\nWhole towns and villages in Puerto Rico were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their lasting influence of Canarian culture can still be heard in the Puerto Rican accent and seen in the \"cuatro\", a small guitar with origins in the Canary Islands. The Canarian Islands have contributed more to the Puerto Rican population than any other Spanish region except Andalusia, and Canary Islanders, along with Andalusians, were the principal Spanish expatriate community there by the 19th century.\n\nThe Isleños contributed substantially to the development of agriculture, as well as the provincial rural character of Puerto Rican society, preserving their ancestral customs, traditions, folk arts, dialect and festivals that remain features of Puerto Rican culture. They tended to settle in areas where other Isleños were already living, preferring certain rural districts and towns like Camuy, Hatillo and Barceloneta. They concentrated also in San Juan, Ponce, Lares, San Sebastián, Lajas, Mayagüez and Manatí. Many settled in small villages where they intermarried with other Puerto Ricans and with the Jíbaro peasants.\n\nMost of the Isleños arrived on the island married, often with many children, which helped to preserve their customs, traditions, religions, and accent. A group of geneticists from Puerto Rican universities conducted a study of mitochondrial DNA, which is passed through the mother, and found that the present population of Puerto Rico has in its genome a substantial compononent of genes from Guanches, the Canarian aborigines, especially those from the island of Tenerife. In some areas of the island, this Guanche component appears in over 50% of the sampled population, and in the western part, it appears in over 80%. Even today, there are people in these towns who can relate stories from their Canary Island great-grandparents that they remember when they were children.\n\nIn 1501, Nicolás de Ovando left the Canary Islands with a group of Canarians, some of them from Lanzarote, and sailed to Hispaniola island. There was also an influx of Canarian settlers, who arrived on the colony of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic) in the second half of the 16th century. Santo Domingo, in the mid-17th century, still had a very small population and suffered economic hardship. The Spanish authorities believed that the French, who had occupied the western part of the island (now Haiti), might also try to take the eastern half of the island, now the Dominican Republic. They asked the Spanish crown to send Canarian families to stop French expansion.\n\nBy the royal decree of May 6, 1663, under the policy of the \"tributo de sangre\", 800 Canarian families were sent to the island. There were 97 Canarian families who arrived in 1684 and founded San Carlos de Tenerife (in 1911, it became a neighborhood of the city of Santo Domingo). The Spanish authorities there concentrated resources on agriculture and livestock, and incorporated a municipality and a church dedicated to the city's patroness, \"Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria\" (Our Lady of Candelaria). The population increased with the arrival of 39 families in 1700 and another 49 in 1709. Canarian families who arrived that year had to bribe the governor to be permitted to remain there.\n\nIn the first decades of the 18th century, another group of Canarian emigrated to Santiago de los Caballeros, where they formed a militia made up exclusively of Canarians, and another in Frontera, where the group founded Banica and Hincha in 1691 and 1702, respectively. In the latter two settlements the raising of livestock prospered thanks to the growing trade with Haiti. The lack of financial resources and the War of the Spanish Succession led to a decrease in Canarian immigration to the area. Afterwards, Canarian immigration increase significantly but came to a standstill again between 1742 and 1749 as a result of the war with England. The Canarians settled mainly on the border with Haiti to prevent French territorial expansion of the country, founding San Rafael de Angostura, San Miguel de la Atalaya, the Las Caobas and Dajabón) as well as ports in strategic locations in Monte Cristi Province with the arrival of 46 families between 1735 and 1736, Puerto Plata (1736), Samana (1756) and Sabana de la Mar (1760). The Canarians also founded San Carlos de Tenerife, Baní, Neiba, San Juan de la Maguana and Jánico.\n\nAfter 1764, the Canarians were sent primarily to the Cibao. The thriving border towns there were abandoned in 1794, when the area become part of Haiti during the Haitian domination (1822–1844). Isleños on the now Haitian side of the border moved to the interior of the island, and some of them, especially of those from Cibao, moved to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The Isleños were, for a time, the fastest-growing ethnic group in the Dominican Republic. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the flow of Canarians emigrating to the country slowed to a trickle.\n\nPedro Santana, the first president of the Dominican Republic, rented several Venezuelan ships during the mid-19th century period of border disputes with Haiti to carry Isleños to the Dominican Republic, but most of the 2,000 who emigrated returned to Venezuela in 1862, when José Antonio Páez came to power. Many of the Canarians who settled in the Dominican Republic (including Jose Trujillo Monagas, originally from Gran Canaria and the grandfather of the later dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo), settled in the capital and in rural areas, especially in the east. During the first half of the 20th century, some groups of Canarians emigrated to the Dominican Republic, many of them Republican exiles who came during and after the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). 300 Canarians arrived in 1955, when Trujillo encouraged Spanish emigration to his country to raise the white population, but most of them left and went to Venezuela because of the harsh conditions. Some of them remained in Constanza and in El Cibao. Isleños contributed to the development of agriculture in the Dominican Republic with their raising of crops like coffee, cocoa and tobacco.\n\nDuring colonial times and until the end of the Second World War, most European immigrants in Venezuela were Canary Islanders. Their cultural impact was significant, influencing both the development of Castilian Spanish in the country as well as its cuisine and customs. Venezuela has perhaps the largest population of Canarian immigrants, and it is commonly said in the Canary Islands that \"Venezuela is the eighth island of the Canary Islands.\" In the 16th century, the German Jorge de la Espira in the Canary Islands recruited 200 men to colonize Venezuela, as did Diego Hernández de Serpa, governor of New Andalusia Province, who sent another 200 soldiers and 400 slaves from Gran Canaria to Venezuela, where some of these Canarians were among the founders of Cumaná. Diego de Ordaz, governor of Paria, took about 350 persons, and his successor, Jerome of Ortal, about 80 people, from Tenerife, whether they were native Canarians or just people settled in the islands. In 1681, 54 families from Tenerife were transported to the port of Cumaná, but this area was so unsafe that a few of them settled in villages already founded or went to the Llanos. The next year, another group of 31 families arrived from Tenerife as well.\n\n25 Canarian families were transported to Guyana in 1717 to found a village, and they then migrated to the Llanos of Venezuela. In 1697, Maracaibo was founded with 40 Canarian families, which was followed in 1700 by another 29 in the town of Los Marqueses. Maracaibo received 25 Canarian families between 1732 and 1738, while in 1764 another 14 families arrived, to which were added another 300 families transported to Venezuela.\n\nMany of those who fought in the Venezuelan War of Independence in the first half of the 19th century were Canarians or descendants of Canarians. For example, Simón Bolívar had Canarian ancestors on his mother's side. There were many other notable Venezuelan leaders who were of Canarian descent, such as the precursor of independence Francisco de Miranda, the philosopher Andrés Bello and the physician José Gregorio Hernández, as well as José Antonio Páez, José María Vargas, Carlos Soublette, José Tadeo Monagas, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, Rómulo Betancourt and Rafael Caldera. More than 9,000 Canarians emigrated to Venezuela between 1841 and 1844, and in 1875, more than 5,000 Canarians arrived.\n\nSince 1936, most Canarian immigrants have gone either to Cuba or to Venezuela (some of those who emigrated to Venezuela came from Cuba) because they encouraged immigration, especially of Spanish citizens, and since 1948, most have emigrated to Venezuela, a massive immigration that did not end until the early 1980s, but there was a significant decrease in the 1970s, with the beginning of Canarian emigration to other European countries. Canarians and their descendants are now scattered throughout Venezuela.\n\nThe first Canarians to emigrate to Uruguay were settled in Montevideo to populate the region, arriving in two different groups. The first group was established in the city on November 19, 1726, and 25 Canarian families came to Montevideo. They organized quickly to survive in that area. The first civilian authorities in Montevideo were Canarian, and they were first to give Spanish names to roads and geographic features. The second group, with 30 Canarian families, arrived in the city on March 27, 1729. Others places in Uruguay where Canary Islanders settled were Colonia, San José, Maldonado, Canelones and Soria.\n\nIn 1808, the Canarian merchant Francisco Aguilar y Leal sent an expedition of 200 people from the eastern islands of the Canaries to Montevideo. Between 1835 and 1845 about 8,200 Canarians, more than half of Lanzarote's population, emigrated to Uruguay, and groups of them continued to come sporadically until about 1900. During the 19th century, more than 10,000 Canarians settled in Uruguay, the majority from the eastern islands; however, only 5700 or so of them remained permanently in Uruguay. A few groups of Canary Islanders continued to arrive through the early 20th century, still coming mainly from the eastern islands, but specific figures are not available. Canarians and Canarian descendants are scattered throughout Uruguay. Uruguay ranks fifth after Venezuela, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic in the number of people of Canarian descent among its population.\n\nDescendants of Canary Islanders are a small community in Mexico, but their presence is notable especially in the business world and in the tourism industry. A few Canarian families emigrated to Mexico in the 17th century (as in the case of the Azuaje families). In the 18th century, when the Spanish crown encouraged Canarian emigration to the Americas through the \"Tributo de sangre\" (Blood Tribute), many of them settled in Yucatán, where by the 18th century they controlled the trade network that distributed goods throughout the peninsula; their descendants are still counted among the most influential families of direct Spanish descent in Mexico. During the 20th century, another group of Canarians settled in Mexico in the early 1930s, and as with Galician and other Spanish immigrants of the time, there were high rates of illiteracy and impoverishment among them, but they adapted relatively quickly. While the Spanish Civil War was still being fought in Spain, the prominent Canarian intellectual Agustin Millares Carlo from Las Palmas became an expatriate in Mexico in 1938. University professor Jorge Hernández Millares, who did important work in the subject of geography, went into exile in Mexico after the war.\n\nTwo Spanish expeditions to Panama were led by Canarians. The first was organized by Pedrarias Dávila, who recruited fifty good swimmers from Gomera to dive for pearls in 1514. The men, however, were dispersed when they came ashore. Another expedition was led in 1519 by López de Sosa, who was appointed by the Spanish government to replace Dávila and recruited 200 of his neighbors on Gran Canaria to participate in the conquest of Central America.\n\nIn 1534, Bartolomé García Muxica, founder of Nombre de Dios, Panama, brought a group of Canary Islanders to the country. These were among the few Canarians who emigrated to Panama in that century.\n\nIn 1787, 306 Canarians arrived on the Mosquito Coast of Honduras. The plan for populating the area failed, however, because of the hostility they encountered from the Zambos and the Miskito Indians, as well as the general unhealthiness of the area. They were able to successfully establish themselves near the Honduran port of Trujillo, where they could farm the surrounding lands, and in the highlands where they founded the town of Macuelizo in 1788.\n\nIn 1884, over 8,000 Canarians emigrated to a small town in Costa Rica when the country invited Canarian immigration to populate the uninhabited town (some Canarians had already settled in Costa Rica, beginning in the 16th century). A Canarian from Lanzarote island, Jose Martinez, was among the first Spanish settlers to arrive in Costa Rica in the 16th century.\n\nThe number of Canary islanders who emigrated to Argentina before the 19th century was very low, although three companies of soldiers from Tenerife who were with Pedro de Mendoza when he founded Buenos Aires in 1535 decided to stay, they intermarried with natives and/or other Spanish settlers. Several ships came to Buenos Aires with immigrant Canarians in 1830; a group of them settled in the interior and another group settled in the capital (the descendants of those families have spread gradually throughout the country). Although the number of Canarians who immigrated to Argentina during the 19th century was not comparable to the number of those who emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Uruguay, in some years there were relatively large numbers of Canarian immigrants; for example, between 1878 and 1888, 3,033 Canarians emigrated. The emigration rate to Argentina was relatively high among the islanders in the 20th century, but did not reach the volume of those who went to Cuba and Venezuela. Even so, in the 1930s, the Canarian government put the number of Canarians and their descendants in that country at about 80,000 people. In 1984 there were 1,038 Canarians in Buenos Aires. They formed several organizations to preserve their ethnic heritage and provide mutual aid. Several Canarian families from Buenos Aires settled in Paraguay, where they founded the town of Candelaria.\n\nIn Colombia, in 1536, Pedro Fernández de Lugo led an expedition of 1,500 people, 400 of whom were Canarians from all the different islands that make up the archipelago), for the conquest of the area around what became Santa Marta. This contingent pacified the warring tribes on the coast and penetrated into the interior. On the way, they founded several cities, two which, Las Palmas and Tenerife, still exist. In addition, Pedro de Heredia led 100 men from the Canary Islands to Cartagena de Indias.\n\nIn the 16th century (a period in which the Canary Islands were still being populated by Spaniards who replaced the indigenous Guanches), many people who emigrated to the Americas from there were, in fact, Spaniards from the mainland of Europe or foreigners, making it difficult to know how many of the immigrants were actually Canarians. There are records also of some Canarians and Canarian families, at least some of them known to be from Lanzarote, who settled in Cartagena de Indias and Cáceres, Antioquia, in the second half of the 16th century. Others emigrated in 1678 by the terms of the\"Tributo de Sangre\" to Santa Marta.\n\nIn 1903, a fleet arrived in Budi Lake, Chile, with 88 Canarian families—400 persons—that currently have more than 1,000 descendants. They responded to the government's call to populate this region and signed contracts for the benefit of a private company. Some were arrested while trying to escape their servitude, and the indigenous Mapuche people took pity on the plight of these Canarians who were established on their former lands. The Indians welcomed them and joined their demonstrations in the so-called \"revolt of the Canarians\", and many Canarians intermarried with Mapuches.\n\nLittle is known about any Canary emigration to Brazil. It is known, however, that since the 16th century, the Canary Islands were a transit point for European vessels bound for the Americas (many of them to Brazil), and it is likely that some of them were carrying Canarians to the Portuguese colony.\nDue to the difficult circumstances of travel, several expeditions that had left Lanzarote for Uruguay were forced to end their passage in other places, such as Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina island. By 1812, a small group of Canarians (all of them from Lanzarote) lived on Santa Catarina island, in the south of Brazil. A study by W.F. Piazza notes that parish records from 1814 to 1818 show 20 families from Lanzarote living there. Rixo Alvarez speaks of the expeditions of Polycarp Medinilla, a Portuguese based in Lanzarote, and Agustín González Brito, from Arrecife. The settlers from Lanzarote were forced to disembark in Rio de Janeiro. Only an estimated 50 Canary Islanders emigrated to Brazil in this century. During the last years of the 19th century, some propaganda leaflets were printed to promoting the emigration to Brazil of Canarians to work as laborers. How effective they were is unknown. There were other publications distributed in the Canary Islands that opposed emigration movement, and the Canarian press depicted a very negative view of the quality of life for migrants in Brazil. Some ships transporting Canary Islander emigrants to Venezuela during the early 20th century were blown off course and landed in Brazil, the French Antilles, Guayana or Trinidad Island where they were permanently settled, as well as others who emigrated directly to Brazil from the Canary Islands. A few Canarians on vessels headed to Venezuela were shipwrecked on the Brazilian coast in the 1960s.\n\nDue to proximity of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire to South America and the establishment of economic ties between the Netherlands (the ruler of Curaçao) and Viceroyalty of New Granada (which includes present-day countries of Colombia and Venezuela), Canarian settlers from nearby Venezuela lived on the islands; children from affluent Canarian Venezuelan families were educated on the islands. In the 19th century, Curaçaoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Brión were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and Colombia. Political refugees from the mainland (such as Simon Bolivar) regrouped in Curaçao. While many Canarians returned to Venezuela after its independence, many of them remained in Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire.\n\n\n"}

Despite the name, it does not traditionally contain pineapple; rather, the name refers to the look of the characteristic topping (which resembles the texture of a pineapple).\n\nIn June 2014, the Hong Kong Government listed the pineapple bun as a part of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage. Tai Tung Bakery in Yuen Long, which had been making pineapple buns for more than 70 years, was a key proponent of including the technique for making the buns on the list of 480 items of living heritage.\n\nThe top of the pineapple bun (the part which is made to resemble a pineapple) is made of a dough similar to that used to make sugar cookies, which consists of sugar, eggs, flour, and lard. It is crunchy and is quite sweet compared to the bread underneath. The bread dough underneath is the same as that used in Chinese-style Western breads, which is a softer and sweeter dough than in Western breads. It is popular at breakfast or afternoon tea.\n\nAlthough it is known as a \"pineapple bun\", the traditional version contains no pineapple. The name originated from the fact that its sugary top crust is cooked to a golden-brown color, and because its checkered top resembles the epicarp of a pineapple.\n\nMany Hong Kong restaurants, such as \"cha chaan tengs\" and \"dai pai dongs\", offer an item called a buttered pineapple bun, which is a pineapple bun with a piece of butter stuffed inside. They are known in Cantonese as boh loh yau (菠蘿油), in which \"boh loh\" means \"pineapple\", and \"yau\" (oil) refers to butter. Variants of this include using custard in place of butter.\n\nTypically, the bun would be brought hot from the oven to the diner's table, and served halved with a large slab of butter in between the halves. This item is sometimes criticised for containing too much fat and cholesterol.\n\nThe pineapple bun may come in miniature sizes (迷你菠蘿包), it may be used as a bread roll for sandwiches with luncheon meat (餐肉菠蘿包), or it may be pre-stuffed with red bean paste (紅豆菠蘿包), custard cream (奶黃菠蘿包), barbecued pork (叉燒菠蘿包), or a sweet filling of shredded coconut (椰絲菠蘿包) like that in a cocktail bun. It is possible to order a \"pineapple pineapple bun\", actually stuffed with pineapple (菠蘿菠蘿包), although this is very likely the product of misinterpretation of the name by non-native bakers.\n\nJapanese melonpan and Korean soboro bread are variants that use the same ingredients for a German streusel-like texture on top but without resemblance to a pineapple.\n\n\nIn September 2014, a police raid found that, unwittingly, several suppliers (including Starbucks, 7-Eleven and Cafe Express) had been selling pineapple buns made with tainted oil, known as \"gutter oil\", from an unlicensed factory in Taiwan. This oil was recycled from kitchen waste, as well as being a by-product of leather processing and offal from slaughterhouses.\n\n"}

Key words are calculated by carrying out a statistical test (e.g., loglinear or chi-squared) which compares the word frequencies in a text against their expected frequencies derived in a much larger corpus, which acts as a reference for general language use. Keyness is then the quality a word or phrase has of being \"key\" in its context.\n\nCompare this with collocation, the quality linking two words or phrases usually assumed to be within a given span of each other. Keyness is a \"textual\" feature, not a language feature (so a word has keyness in a certain textual context but may well not have keyness in other contexts, whereas a node and collocate are often found together in texts of the same genre so collocation is to a considerable extent a \"language\" phenomenon). The set of keywords found in a given text share keyness, they are co-key. Words typically found in the same texts as a key word are called \"associates\". \n\n\n\n"}

Butter tea probably originated in the Himalayan region between Greater Tibet and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nTraditionally, it is made from tea leaves, yak butter, water, and salt, although butter made from cow's milk is increasingly used, given its wider availability and lower cost.\n\nDrinking butter tea is a regular part of Tibetan life. Before work, a Tibetan will typically enjoy several bowlfuls of this beverage, and it is always served to guests. Since butter is the main ingredient, butter tea provides plenty of caloric energy and is particularly suited to high altitudes. The butter may also help prevent chapped lips.\n\nAccording to the Tibetan custom, butter tea is drunk in separate sips, and after each sip, the host refills the bowl to the brim. Thus, the guest never drains his bowl; rather, it is constantly topped up. If the visitor does not wish to drink, the best thing to do is leave the tea untouched until the time comes to leave and then drain the bowl. In this way, etiquette is observed and the host will not be offended.\n\nButter tea is also used for eating \"tsampa\" by pouring onto it, or dipping the tsampa into it, and mixing well.\n\nThe concentrate, produced by repeatedly boiling tea leaves, will keep for several days and is commonly used in towns. The tea is then combined with salt and butter in a special tea churn (), and churned vigorously before serving hot. Now an electric blender is often used.\n\nThe history of tea in Tibet dates back to the 7th century during the Tang dynasty. However, it did not reach its nearly universal status until about the 13th century, the time of the Sakya hierarchy and the Phagmodu kings.\n\nThe highest quality tea is made by boiling the tea leaves in water for half a day, achieving a dark brown color. It is then skimmed, and poured into a cylinder with fresh yak butter and salt which is then shaken. The result is a purplish liquid that is about the thickness of a stew or thick oil. It is then poured into clay tea-pots, or jars.\n\nAnother method is to boil water and add handfuls of the tea into the water, which is allowed to steep until it turns almost black. Salt is then added, along with a little soda if wanted. The tea is then strained through a horse-hair or reed colander into a wooden butter churn, and a large lump of butter is added. This is then churned until the tea reaches the proper consistency and transferred to copper pots that sit on a brazier to keep them warm. When a churn is not available, a wooden bowl and rapid stirring will suffice.\n\nNowadays, when tea leaves, yak butter and wooden butter churns are not available, people often make butter tea using tea bags, different types of butter available in the market and a blender to churn.\n\n\n"}

Derived from the diaphragm of a steer or heifer, it typically weighs about . This cut is taken from the plate, which is the lower belly of the animal. In the past it was sometimes known as \"butcher's steak\", because butchers would often keep it for themselves rather than offer it for sale.\n\nHanger steak resembles flank steak in texture and flavor. It is a vaguely V-shaped pair of muscles with a long, inedible membrane running down the middle. The hanger steak is usually the tenderest cut on an animal. \n\nAnatomically speaking, the hanger steak is the crura, or legs, of the diaphragm. The steak is said to \"hang\" from the diaphragm of the heifer or steer. The diaphragm is one muscle, commonly cut into two separate cuts of meat: the hanger steak, traditionally considered more flavorful, and the outer skirt steak, composed of tougher muscle from the dome of the diaphragm. The hanger is attached to the last rib and to the front of several of the lumbar vertebrae. The right side is larger and stronger than the left.\n\nOccasionally seen on menus as a \"bistro steak\", hanger steak is also very traditional in Mexican cuisine, particularly in the north where it is known as \"arrachera\", and is generally marinated, grilled and served with a squeeze of lime juice, guacamole, salsa, scallions and tortillas to roll tacos. In South Texas this cut of beef is known as \"fajitas arracheras\". It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as flap steak or flap meat, which is a distinctly different cut.\n\nThe hanger steak has historically been more popular in Europe. In Britain it is referred to as \"skirt\", which is not to be confused with the American skirt steak.

It is often prepared communally as a social gathering. It is popular as the basis for civic fund-raisers in the American Midwest and South.\n\nThe term is of uncertain origin, possibly from Welsh or Arabic.\n\nTraditional burgoo was made using whatever meats and vegetables were available—typically including venison, squirrel, opossum, raccoon, or game birds—and was often associated with autumn and the harvest season. Today, local barbecue restaurants use a specific meat in their recipes, usually pork, chicken, or mutton, which, along with the spices used, creates a flavor unique to each restaurant.\n\nA typical burgoo is a combination of meats and vegetables: Common meats are pork, chicken, mutton or beef, often hickory-smoked, but other meats are seen occasionally. Common vegetables are lima beans, corn, okra, tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes. Typically, since burgoo is a slow-cooked dish, the starch from the added vegetables results in thickening of the stew. However, a thickening agent, such as cornmeal, ground beans, whole wheat, or potato starch can be used when cooked in a non-traditional way. In addition, soup bones can be added for taste and thickening.\n\nThe ingredients are combined in order of cooking time required, with meat first, vegetables next, and thickening agents as necessary. It is said that a spoon can stand up in a good burgoo. Cider vinegar, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, or chili powder are common condiments.\n\nCooking burgoo in Kentucky often serves as a communal effort and social event in which each attendee brings one or more ingredients. In Kentucky and surrounding states such as Indiana, burgoo is often used for school fund-raising. This has been claimed as an invention of the family of Ollie Beard, a former Major League Baseball player.\n\nMany places hold great pride in their Burgoo, and it is a common feature in local events. The village of Arenzville, Illinois asserts itself as the home of the world's best burgoo and holds a yearly burgoo festival, as does Chandlerville, Illinois, both in Cass County. Several cities claim to be the burgoo capital of the world, including Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, and Franklin, Illinois.

A baetyl is also mentioned in the Bible at Bethel in the Book of Genesis in the story of Jacob's Ladder.\nIn the Phoenician mythology related by Sanchuniathon, one of the sons of Uranus was named \"Baetylus\". The worship of baetyls was widespread in the Phoenician colonies, including Carthage, even after the adoption of Christianity, and was denounced by Augustine of Hippo.\n\nIn ancient Greek religion and mythology, the term was specially applied to the Omphalos, the stone supposed to have been swallowed by Cronus (who feared misfortune from his own children) in mistake for his infant son Zeus, for whom it had been substituted by Gaea. This stone was carefully preserved at Delphi, anointed with oil every day and on festive occasions covered with raw wool.\n\nIn Rome, there was the stone effigy of Cybele, called \"Mater Idaea Deum\", that had been ceremoniously brought from Pessinus in Asia Minor in 204 BC. Another conical meteorite was enshrined in the Elagabalium to personify the Syrian deity Elagabalus.\n\nIn some cases an attempt was made to give a more regular form to the original shapeless stone: thus Apollo Agyieus was represented by a conical pillar with a pointed end, Zeus Meilichius in the form of a pyramid. Other famous baetylic idols were those in the temples of Zeus Casius at Seleucia Pieria, and of Zeus Teleios at Tegea. Even in the declining years of paganism, these idols still retained their significance, as is shown by the attacks upon them by ecclesiastical writers.\n\nA similar practice survives today with the Kaaba's Black Stone, which was worshiped by pre-Islamic polytheists. \n\n\n\n"}

It is one of several iconic types of baked goods originating from Hong Kong.\n\nThe cocktail bun is said to have been created in the 1950s in Hong Kong, when the proprietors of a bakery resisted the wasteful disposal of unsold but perfectly edible buns. The solution was to incorporate these buns into a new product to be sold fresh. The day-old buns were ground up, with sugar and coconut added in, to create a tasty filling mixture; fresh bread dough was wrapped around this mixture to make the first filled \"cocktail bun\".\n\nIts name is said to have come from comparing the baker's mixture of hodgepodge of ingredients to a bartender's exotic mixture of alcoholic liquors, both formulating a \"cocktail\". The Chinese name is a literal translation of \"cocktail\", and is called a \"chicken-tail bun\".\n\nOriginally, the filling was made of blending day-old buns with granulated sugar. Newer versions saw the addition of shredded coconut and butter or margarine to the recipe, which are now key ingredients in the cocktail bun filling. Each bun is approximately 6 to 8 inches long and 2 to 3 inches high in the shape of a small baguette. The cocktail bun can be found in many Chinese bakeries along with other popular sweet buns like the pineapple bun, which also originated from Hong Kong.\n\nThe bun itself is soft, pliable and lightly sweet, typical of Hong Kong-style breads. The coconut-based filling is dense and has a rich, buttery and sweet flavour. A final egg wash to the exterior lends a shiny, golden-brown colour to the tops, which are further decorated with stripes or other simple designs using some of the buttery coconut filling, and often finished with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.\n\nTaiwanese version of the cocktail bun are slightly firmer than their Hong Kong counterparts, but maintain the same filling and sesame seed dusting.\n\n"}

Different types of Barfi vary in their colour and texture.\n\nThe most popular spice used to flavour this dessert is cardamom. However, dependent on where it is prepared, many different flavourings are added to this simple but popular dessert. Adding edible silver leaf (\"vark\") to the edges of barfi is popular when the sweet confection is to be served at an important event such as a wedding or other such occasion. For added flavour and to provide a colourful contrast, often it is rolled in crushed nuts before it is served.\n\nThe confection is served in India, all year round, but especially consumed during the holiday seasons, wedding ceremonies, and the religious festivals.

Community stews are often made at \"hobo jungles\", or at events designed to help homeless people.\n\nThe earliest known mulligan stew was created by Grandma Dolly, in Birch Manor, South City. A description of mulligan stew appeared in a 1900 newspaper:\nAnother traveler present described the operation of making a \"mulligan.\" Five or six hobos join in this. One builds a fire and rustles a can. Another has to procure meat; another potatoes; one fellow pledges himself to obtain bread, and still another has to furnish onions, salt and pepper. If a chicken can be stolen, so much the better. The whole outfit is placed in the can and boiled until it is done. If one of the men is successful in procuring \"Java,\" an oyster can is used for a coffee tank, and this is also put on the fire to boil. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that California hobos always put a \"snipe\" in their coffee, to give it that delicate amber color and to add to the aroma. \"Snipe\" is hobo for the butt end of a cigar that smokers throw down in the streets. All hobos have large quantities of snipes in their pockets, for both chewing and smoking purposes. A \"beggar stew\" is a \"mulligan,\" without any meat.\n\n\"Mulligan\" is a stand-in term for any Irishman, and Mulligan stew is simply an Irish stew that includes meat, potatoes, vegetables, and whatever else can be begged, scavenged, found or stolen. A local Appalachian variant is a burgoo, which may comprise such available ingredients as opossum or squirrel. Only a pot and a fire are required. The hobo who put it together was known as the \"mulligan mixer.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, homeless men (hobos) would sleep in a \"hobo jungle\" (a campsite used by the homeless near a railway). Traditionally, the jungle would have a large campfire and a pot into which each person would put in a portion of their food, to create a shared dish that was, hopefully, more tasteful and varied than his original portion. Usually, they would afterward enjoy themselves with story-telling and, sometimes, the drinking of alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The original purpose of this food was to make it possible to eat hot dogs without burning one’s hands. There are two basic types: top-loading New England-style hot dog buns or \"lobster buns\" in some areas, and side-loading buns, common in the rest of the United States, also called American style buns. There are also regional variations such as the poppy seed adorned buns of Chicago.\n\nThe advantages to a top loader are that it holds the hot dog securely and fits nicely into little three-sided paper boxes. Top loaders are generally baked side by side and torn apart as needed, leaving a flat side surface for grilling; however it is debatable as to whether this is actually an advantage over the U-shaped underside (similar to a submarine hull) of side loaders which are able to fit snugly between grills, providing deep heating to the sausage.\n\nHot dog historian and professor emeritus at Roosevelt University Bruce Kraig believes the term \"hot dog\" was invented in the late 19th century by American observers of German immigrants, who ate sausages on buns. The Americans joked that the sausages looked suspiciously like the Germans' dachshunds.\n\nCharles Feltman invented an elongated hot dog bun on Coney Island in 1871 according to writer Jefferey Stanton.\n\nAt the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, in St. Louis, Missouri, a German concessionaire, Antoine Feuchtwanger, served hot sausages called 'frankfurters', after his birthplace, Frankfurt, in Hesse. At first he loaned gloves for his customers to hold his sausages. When many were not returned, he asked his brother, who was a baker, to invent a solution. Thus, the hot dog bun was born.\n\nSplit top hotdog buns are popular in New England for lobster rolls and clam sandwiches.\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, where poppy-seed buns are popularly served with Chicago-style hot dogs, the buns are made with high-gluten flour to hold up to steaming.\n\nIn Austria, a \"hot dog\" is a baguette which is hollowed out by cutting off the end and impaling it on a spike so a sausage can be inserted. In Denmark this variation is known as a \"French Hot Dog\" because of the use of baguette, and a \"French Hot Dog Dressing\" which contains Dijon Mustard.

It was originally part of a poor man's meal in the countryside, but has recently become renowned due to the unique character used in its name.\n\nDishes with this noodle are often topped with lots of red hot peppers for the cold winter in Shaanxi.\n\nMade up of 58 strokes in its traditional form (42 in simplified Chinese), the Chinese character for \"biáng\" is one of the most complex Chinese characters in modern usage, although the character is not found in modern dictionaries or even in the Kangxi dictionary.\n\nThe character is composed of (speak; 7 strokes) in the middle flanked by (tiny; 2×3 strokes) on both sides. Below it, (horse; 10 strokes) is similarly flanked by (grow; 2×8 strokes). This central block itself is surrounded by (moon; 4 strokes) to the left, (heart; 4 strokes) below, and (knife; 2 strokes) to the right.

However, since the character is not found in the \"Kangxi Dictionary\", it may have been created much later than the time of Li Si. Similar characters were found used by Tiandihui.\n\nIn the 2007 season of the TVB show \"The Web\" (), the show's producers tried to find the origin of the character by contacting university professors, but they could not verify the Li Si story or the origin of the character. It was concluded that the character was invented by a noodle shop.\n\nOne theory is that there was no such character or meaning for this word in the beginning, and the word actually came from the sound people make from chewing the noodles, \"biang biang biang\".\n\nA legend about a student fabricating a character for the noodle to get out of a biangbiang noodle bill also is a commonly believed theory about the origin of the character.\n\nAccording to an article on \"China Daily\", the word \"biang\" actually refers to the sound made by the chef when he creates the noodles by pulling the dough and slapping it on the table.\n\nFifteen variants of the Traditional character for \"biáng\", having between 56 and 70 strokes:\n\n"}

{"id": "2655280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2655280", "title": "Image noise", "text": "Image noise\n\nImage noise is random variation of brightness or color information in images, and is usually an aspect of electronic noise. It can be produced by the sensor and circuitry of a scanner or digital camera. Image noise can also originate in film grain and in the unavoidable shot noise of an ideal photon detector. Image noise is an undesirable by-product of image capture that obscures the desired information. \n\nThe original meaning of \"noise\" was \"unwanted signal\"; unwanted electrical fluctuations in signals received by AM radios caused audible acoustic noise (\"static\"). By analogy, unwanted electrical fluctuations are also called \"noise\". \n\nImage noise can range from almost imperceptible specks on a digital photograph taken in good light, to optical and radioastronomical images that are almost entirely noise, from which a small amount of information can be derived by sophisticated processing. Such a noise level would be unacceptable in a photograph since it would be impossible even to determine the subject.\n\nPrincipal sources of Gaussian noise in digital images arise during acquisition. The sensor has inherent noise due to the level of illumination and its own temperature, and the electronic circuits connected to the sensor inject their own share of electronic circuit noise.\n\nA typical model of image noise is Gaussian, additive, independent at each pixel, and independent of the signal intensity, caused primarily by Johnson–Nyquist noise (thermal noise), including that which comes from the reset noise of capacitors (\"kTC noise\"). Amplifier noise is a major part of the \"read noise\" of an image sensor, that is, of the constant noise level in dark areas of the image. In color cameras where more amplification is used in the blue color channel than in the green or red channel, there can be more noise in the blue channel. At higher exposures, however, image sensor noise is dominated by shot noise, which is not Gaussian and not independent of signal intensity. Also, there are many Gaussian denoising algorithms. \n\nFat-tail distributed or \"impulsive\" noise is sometimes called salt-and-pepper noise or spike noise. An image containing salt-and-pepper noise will have dark pixels in bright regions and bright pixels in dark regions. This type of noise can be caused by analog-to-digital converter errors, bit errors in transmission, etc. It can be mostly eliminated by using dark frame subtraction, median filtering, combined median and mean filtering and interpolating around dark/bright pixels.\n\nDead pixels in an LCD monitor produce a similar, but non-random, display.\n\nThe dominant noise in the darker parts of an image from an image sensor is typically that caused by statistical quantum fluctuations, that is, variation in the number of photons sensed at a given exposure level. This noise is known as photon shot noise. Shot noise has a root-mean-square value proportional to the square root of the image intensity, and the noises at different pixels are independent of one another. Shot noise follows a Poisson distribution, which except at very low intensity levels approximates a Gaussian distribution.\n\nIn addition to photon shot noise, there can be additional shot noise from the dark leakage current in the image sensor; this noise is sometimes known as \"dark shot noise\" or \"dark-current shot noise\". Dark current is greatest at \"hot pixels\" within the image sensor. The variable dark charge of normal and hot pixels can be subtracted off (using \"dark frame subtraction\"), leaving only the shot noise, or random component, of the leakage. If dark-frame subtraction is not done, or if the exposure time is long enough that the hot pixel charge exceeds the linear charge capacity, the noise will be more than just shot noise, and hot pixels appear as salt-and-pepper noise.\n\nThe noise caused by quantizing the pixels of a sensed image to a number of discrete levels is known as quantization noise. It has an approximately uniform distribution. Though it can be signal dependent, it will be signal independent if other noise sources are big enough to cause dithering, or if dithering is explicitly applied.\n\nThe grain of photographic film is a signal-dependent noise, with similar statistical distribution to shot noise. If film grains are uniformly distributed (equal number per area), and if each grain has an equal and independent probability of developing to a dark silver grain after absorbing photons, then the number of such dark grains in an area will be random with a binomial distribution. In areas where the probability is low, this distribution will be close to the classic Poisson distribution of shot noise. A simple Gaussian distribution is often used as an adequately accurate model.\n\nFilm grain is usually regarded as a nearly isotropic (non-oriented) noise source. Its effect is made worse by the distribution of silver halide grains in the film also being random.\n\nSome noise sources show up with a significant orientation in images. For example, image sensors are sometimes subject to row noise or column noise.\n\nA common source of periodic noise in an image is from electrical or electromechanical interference during the image capturing process. An image affected by periodic noise will look like a repeating pattern has been added on top of the original image. In the frequency domain this type of noise can be seen as discrete spikes. Significant reduction of this noise can be achieved by applying notch filters in the frequency domain. The following images illustrate an image affected by periodic noise, and the result of reducing the noise using frequency domain filtering. Note that the filtered image still has some noise on the borders. Further filtering could reduce this border noise, however it may also reduce some of the fine details in the image. The trade-off between noise reduction and preserving fine details is application specific. For example if the fine details on the castle are not considered important, further low pass filtering could be an appropriate option. If the fine details of the castle are considered important, a viable solution may be to crop off the border of the image entirely.\n\nIn low light, correct exposure requires the use of slow shutter speed (i.e. long exposure time), higher gain (ISO sensitivity), or both. On most cameras, slower shutter speeds lead to increased salt-and-pepper noise due to photodiode leakage currents. At the cost of a doubling of read noise variance (41% increase in read noise standard deviation), this salt-and-pepper noise can be mostly eliminated by dark frame subtraction. Banding noise, similar to shadow noise, can be introduced through brightening shadows or through color-balance processing.\n\nThe relative effect of both read noise and shot noise increase as the exposure is reduced, corresponding to increased ISO sensitivity, since fewer photons are counted (shot noise) and since more amplification of the signal is necessary.\n\nThe size of the image sensor, or effective light collection area per pixel sensor, is the largest determinant of signal levels that determine signal-to-noise ratio and hence apparent noise levels, assuming the aperture area is proportional to sensor area, or that the f-number or focal-plane illuminance is held constant. That is, for a constant f-number, the sensitivity of an imager scales roughly with the sensor area, so larger sensors typically create lower noise images than smaller sensors. In the case of images bright enough to be in the shot noise limited regime, when the image is scaled to the same size on screen, or printed at the same size, the pixel count makes little difference to perceptible noise levels – the noise depends primarily on sensor area, not how this area is divided into pixels. For images at lower signal levels (higher ISO settings), where read noise (noise floor) is significant, more pixels within a given sensor area will make the image noisier if the per pixel read noise is the same.\n\nFor instance, the noise level produced by a Four Thirds sensor at ISO 800 is roughly equivalent to that produced by a full frame sensor (with roughly four times the area) at ISO 3200, and that produced by a 1/2.5\" compact camera sensor (with roughly 1/16 the area) at ISO 100. This ability to produce acceptable images at higher sensitivities is a major factor driving the adoption of DSLR cameras, which tend to use larger sensors than compacts. An example shows a DSLR sensor at ISO 400 creating less noise than a point-and-shoot sensor at ISO 100.\n\nThe image sensor has individual photosites to collect light from a given area. Not all areas of the sensor are used to collect light, due to other circuitry. A higher fill factor of a sensor causes more light to be collected, allowing for better ISO performance based on sensor size.\n\nTemperature can also have an effect on the amount of noise produced by an image sensor due to leakage. With this in mind, it is known that DSLRs will produce more noise during summer than winter.\n\nAn image is a picture, photograph or any other form of 2D representation of any scene. Most algorithms for converting image sensor data to an image, whether in-camera or on a computer, involve some form of noise reduction. There are many procedures for this, but all attempt to determine whether the actual differences in pixel values constitute noise or real photographic detail, and average out the former while attempting to preserve the latter. However, no algorithm can make this judgment perfectly (for all cases) , so there is often a tradeoff made between noise removal and preservation of fine, low-contrast detail that may have characteristics similar to noise.\n\nA simplified example of the impossibility of unambiguous noise reduction: an area of uniform red in an image might have a very small black part. If this is a single pixel, it is likely (but not certain) to be spurious and noise; if it covers a few pixels in an absolutely regular shape, it may be a defect in a group of pixels in the image-taking sensor (spurious and unwanted, but not strictly noise); if it is irregular, it may be more likely to be a true feature of the image. But a definitive answer is not available.\n\nThis decision can be assisted by knowing the characteristics of the source image and of human vision. Most noise reduction algorithms perform much more aggressive chroma noise reduction, since there is little important fine chroma detail that one risks losing. Furthermore, many people find luminance noise less objectionable to the eye, since its textured appearance mimics the appearance of film grain.\n\nThe high sensitivity image quality of a given camera (or RAW development workflow) may depend greatly on the quality of the algorithm used for noise reduction. Since noise levels increase as ISO sensitivity is increased, most camera manufacturers increase the noise reduction aggressiveness automatically at higher sensitivities. This leads to a breakdown of image quality at higher sensitivities in two ways: noise levels increase and fine detail is smoothed out by the more aggressive noise reduction.\n\nIn cases of extreme noise, such as astronomical images of very distant objects, it is not so much a matter of noise reduction as of extracting a little information buried in a lot of noise; techniques are different, seeking small regularities in massively random data.\n\nIn video and television, noise refers to the random dot pattern that is superimposed on the picture as a result of electronic noise, the 'snow' that is seen with poor (analog) television reception or on VHS tapes. Interference and static are other forms of noise, in the sense that they are unwanted, though not random, which can affect radio and television signals.\n\nHigh levels of noise are almost always undesirable, but there are cases when a certain amount of noise is useful, for example to prevent discretization artifacts (color banding or posterization). Some noise also increases acutance (apparent sharpness). Noise purposely added for such purposes is called dither; it improves the image perceptually, though it degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n\n"}

This shape allows the ball to be more easily pulled back through a roof or concrete slab after it has broken through.\n\nWrecking balls range from about to around . The ball is made from forged steel, which means the steel is not cast into a mold in a molten state; rather, it is formed under very high pressure while the steel is red hot (soft but not molten) to compress and to strengthen it.\n\nTo demolish roofs and other horizontal spans, the ball is typically suspended by a length of steel chain attached to the lifting hook of a crane boom above the structure, the rope drum clutch is released and the ball is allowed to free-fall onto the structure. To demolish walls the ball is suspended at the desired height from a crane boom and a secondary steel rope pulls the ball toward the crane cab. The lateral rope drum clutch is then released and the ball swings as a pendulum to strike the structure. Another method for lateral demolition is to pivot the crane boom to accelerate the ball toward the target. This is repeated as needed until the structure is broken down into debris that can easily be loaded and hauled away. The demolition action is carried out entirely through the kinetic energy of the ball.\n\nDemolition work has been carried out using a wrecking ball suspended from a Kaman K-MAX helicopter.\n\nThe same mechanism is applied to quarrying rock where an excavator lifts and releases a loose ball (called a drop ball) onto large rocks to reduce them to manageable size.\n\nThe advancement of technology led to the development and use of blasting charges, safer than dynamite and more efficient or practical than wrecking balls, to destroy buildings. The most common use of blasting charges is to implode a building, thus limiting collateral damage; see demolition. Wrecking balls are more likely to cause collateral damage, because it is difficult to completely control the swing of the ball.\n\nHowever, wrecking balls are still used when other demolition methods may not be practical, due for example to local environmental issues or the presence of hazardous building materials such as asbestos or lead.\n\n"}

Traditionally it is made from ewe's milk, but now it is more often made industrially from cow's milk. It is popular in the northern regions of Spain (Asturias, Basque Country, Navarre, Castilla y León, La Rioja). In Latin America it is popular in the Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.\n\nCuajada is usually served as dessert with honey and walnuts or sometimes sugar, and, less often, for breakfast with fruit or honey. Raw warmed milk is mixed with rennet or with plant extracts and left to curdle. It was traditionally made in a wooden recipient called a \"kaiku\" and heated with a red-hot poker, giving it a distinct faintly burned taste. \"Cuajada\" means 'curdled' in Spanish. In Basque, it is called \"mamia.\"\n\nA similar product named \"coalhada\", Portuguese for 'curdled', is found mostly in Brazil, especially in rural areas, where traditional recipes are more common. It is made from curdled milk (specifically from putting acidic plant-based substances such as lemon juice, other citrus juice or vinegar on boiled milk, mainly those of cattle or goat) and yogurt.

It is very popular in Israel, commonly found in most cafes and bakeries. It is also a popular treat among Jews in diaspora.\n\nTraditional rugelach are made in the form of a crescent by rolling a triangle of dough around a filling. Some sources state that the rugelach and the French croissant share a common Viennese ancestor, crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the lifting of the Turkish siege, possibly a reference to the Battle of Vienna in 1683. This appears to be an urban legend however, as both the rugelach and its supposed ancestor, the Kipferl, pre-date the Early Modern era, while the croissant in its modern form did not originate earlier than the 19th century (see viennoiserie). This leads many to believe that the croissant is simply a descendant of one of these two.\n\nAn alternative form is constructed much like a strudel or nut roll, but unlike those, the rolled dough and filling are cut into slices before baking.\n\nThe name is Yiddish, the historical language of Ashkenazi Jews. The ' ending () indicates plural, while the ' () can be a diminutive, as, for example, ' (, villages) is the plural of ' (, village), the diminutive of ' (, town). In this case, the root means something like \"twist\" so the translation would be \"little twists,\" a reference to the shape of this cookie. In this context, note that ' () means \"corner\" in Yiddish. In Polish, which influenced Yiddish, ' can mean \"corner\", but can also mean \"horn\" – both the kind on an animal and the musical instrument. Croissant-shaped pastries, which look like horns, are called ' in Polish, see '. ' is almost identical in pronunciation and meaning to the Yiddish word \"\".\n\nAlternatively, some assert that the root is ', meaning \"royal\", possibly a reference to the taste. This explanation is in conflict with Yiddish usage, where the word ' () is the dominant word meaning \"royal\".\n\nFinally, in modern Hebrew, they are known as ' (), a post-biblical Hebrew word meaning \"trailing vines\", though the name ' () is still commonly used by Hebrew speakers. The Yiddish word \"\" probably came first. The modern Hebrew is probably a neologism, chosen for its similarity to the Yiddish and its descriptive meaning.\n\nRugelach can be made with sour cream or cream cheese doughs, but there are also pareve variants (with no dairy ingredients), so that it can be eaten with or after a meat meal and still be kosher. Cream cheese doughs are the most recent, probably American innovations, while yeast leavened and sour cream doughs are much older.\n\nThe different fillings can include raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, chocolate, marzipan, poppy seed, or fruit preserves which are rolled up inside.\n\nRugelach closely resemble schnecken, a Central and Eastern European Jewish pastry that generally has cream cheese dough and is rolled into a cylinder and sliced, becoming a flat spiral, whereas rugelach are formed from individual triangles of dough and rolled into a crescent shape. In recent years, chefs have introduced savory versions of these pastries, filled with chicken and schmaltz or salmon and boursin cheese.\n\n\n\n"}

This is why the day after the night of the \"first dream\" is known as \"Hatsuyume\". This day is January 2 in the gregorian calendar, but was different in the traditional Japanese calendar.\n\nIt is considered to be particularly good luck to dream of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant. This belief has been in place since the early Edo period but there are various theories regarding the origins as to why this particular combination was considered to be auspicious. One theory suggests that this combination is lucky because Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain, the hawk is a clever and strong bird, and the word for eggplant ( \"nasu\" or \"nasubi\") suggests achieving something great ( \"nasu\"). Another theory suggests that this combination arose because Mount Fuji, falconry, and early eggplants were favorites of the \"shōgun\" Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\nAlthough this superstition is well known in Japan, often memorized in the form \"Ichi-Fuji, Ni-Taka, San-Nasubi\" (; 1.

A traditional English Christmas Cake is made with rich, moist currants, sultanas (golden raisins) and raisins which have been soaked in rum. If a Christmas cake is covered in icing, it is quite common for it to be decorated – models of houses, of fir trees or of Father Christmas may be in the array of decorations.\n\nA particular favourite of many is the traditional Scottish Christmas cake, the Whisky Dundee. As the name implies, the cake originated in Dundee and is made with Scotch whisky. It is a light and crumbly cake, and light on fruit and candied peel—only currants, raisins, sultanas and cherries.\n\nCoins were also occasionally added to Christmas cakes as well as Christmas puddings as good luck touch pieces. The usual choices were silver 3d piece, or sixpences, sometimes wrapped in greaseproof paper packages.\n\nIn Yorkshire, Christmas cake, as with other types of fruit cake, can be eaten with cheese, such as Wensleydale.\n\nA cake that may also be served at Christmas time in the United Kingdom, in addition to the traditional Christmas cake, is the cake known as a \"Yule Log, or chocolate log\". This is a Swiss roll that is coated in chocolate, resembling a log.\n\nThe Christmas cake largely displaced the previously popular Twelfth-night cake during the Victorian era.\n\nSome cakes listed below do not contain fruit. For example, the Bûche de Noël does not contain any fruit ; it is not a fruitcake.\n\nIn the United States, some people give fruitcakes as gifts at Christmas time, but they are not called Christmas cakes. In the neighbouring country of Canada, however, such an item is labelled a Christmas cake, at least among the English-speaking majority.\n\nIn India, Christmas cakes are traditionally a fruit cake with many variants. Allahabadi cake is famous for its rich taste and texture. Many smaller and more traditional Christian bakeries add alcohol, usually rum, in the cake. \n\nIn Sri Lanka, Christmas cakes use treacle instead of cane sugar and include spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper.\nIn Japan, Christmas cakes are traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve. They are simply a sponge cake, frosted with whipped cream, often decorated with strawberries, and usually topped with Christmas chocolates or other seasonal fruits, and a Santa Claus decoration. Christmas cakes of this style were originally released by Fujiya, and was popularized when they began sales at Ginza, the central commercial district in Tokyo. This was during the time when Japan was going through massive waves of Westernization, particularly by the upper elite class. Members of the upper class, who had a strong penchant for Western cultures in general, enjoyed Western style desserts as a delicacy. Thus, being a Western style dessert, Christmas cakes were associated with the idea of Western modernity and social status. Therefore, it was a major hit when the Christmas cakes were commercialized and became more affordable to the general public. Different shapes and styles of Christmas cakes are released across the countless numbers of confectionery stores in the country; the cakes are no longer tied down to the traditional form of round white cakes with strawberries and Santa Claus on top. The Christmas cakes today are symbolized as a ritual of Christmas celebration; specifically, the act of sharing the cake with family or friends.\n\nIn the Philippines, Christmas cakes are bright rich yellow pound cakes with macerated nuts or fruitcakes of the British fashion. Both are soaked in copious amounts of brandy or rum mixed with a simple syrup of palm sugar and water. Traditionally, civet musk is added, but rosewater or orange flower water is more common now, as civet musk has become very expensive. These liquor-laden cakes can usually stay fresh for many months provided they are handled properly.\n\nIn Germany, Stollen, a traditional German fruitcake, is popular. During the Christmas season, it's also called \"Weihnachtsstollen\" or \"Christstollen\".\n\nIn Italy, Panettone, a sweet sourdough bread with a distinct cupola shape, is traditionally eaten at Christmas. It contains raisins and candied citrus fruit and is prepared meticulously over several days. Pandoro is a typically a Veronese product. Is traditionally shaped like a frustum with an eight-pointed star section.\n\nIn France and in Lebanon, a Bûche de Noël (Yule Log cake) is the traditional Christmas cake.\n\nIn Cyprus, it is served on Christmas Day. It is the first treat the locals serve to their guests. Cypriot Christmas cake is much like the UK equivalent.\n\nIn Japan, women had traditionally been expected to marry at a young age and those who were unmarried after the age of 25 were sometimes scornfully referred to as \"Christmas cakes\" (unsold after the 25th). The term first became popular during the 1980s but has since become passé because Japanese women today often remain unmarried without stigmatization.\n\n"}

Furthermore, it closely resembles an English Trifle in that it is assembled in layers and includes custard, fruit, sponge cake, and whipped cream.\n\nBanana pudding can be prepared using a baked or refrigerated method, with the latter being the more popular, particularly among home cooks. Moreover, many recipes have been adapted using vanilla or banana pudding instead of a true custard. Other recipes omit the wafers. An early Banana pudding recipe was published in \"The Kentucky Receipt Book,\" by Mary Harris Frazer, in 1903. However, even this recipe does not include wafers.\n\nA typical method for making Banana pudding is to repeatedly layer the bananas, custard and wafers into a dish and top with whipped cream or meringue. Over time, the wafers will absorb the custard and the layers will press together causing the flavors to intermingle.\n\nThe National Banana Pudding Festival began October 2010. It is held at the Centerville River Park and Jerry Dixon Walking Trail located a short distance north from the Centerville Public Square in Centerville, Tennessee. It is a 2-day event held the first weekend of October.\n\nThe National Banana Pudding Festival is the brain child of twelve local community volunteers seeking a way to earn money to cover the costs of helping victims of disasters, fires, tornadoes and floods. In September 2009, they incorporated the National Banana Pudding Festival as a nonprofit corporation and set about bringing their dream to reality. They quickly realized they could do more than just help their cause. They could provide a way for many nonprofit organizations to \"earn\" much needed funds for their causes and missions too.\n\nThe heart of the National Banana Pudding Festival is the Puddin' Path. The Puddin' Path was awarded the \"2014 Best Event Within an Event\" by the Southeastern Festivals & Events Association. It exemplifies the festival's purpose, which is to (1) support nonprofit organizations in the area, (2) engage people in our community, and (3) provide a unique entertainment experience for the festival's guests. Guests can take a stroll down the Puddin' Path and collect 10 samples of banana pudding made by nonprofit organizations.\n\nIn addition to the Puddin' Path, the festival allows guests to watch the finalist in the banana pudding cook-off make their creations for the judges. In 2015, the festival started a new event: the Nation's Best Banana Pudding Professional Cook-Off. Restaurant Chefs / Professionals of this competition will compete for bragging rights of making the \"Nation's Best Banana Pudding.\" All cook-off competitions are open to anyone it the United States.\n\nThe Georgia State Banana Pudding began in May 2015. It is held on the 2.5 acre property of the Blue Goose on Main in the small town of Irwinton, Georgia. The owner of the Blue Goose approached the City of Irwinton and asked for their support of the event after a visit to the National Banana Pudding Festival in 2014. Organizers for the state festival followed the lead of the National Festival and structured the festival so that proceeds would go back into their community. The one day event is held the last Saturday of April.\n\nFestival goers have the opportunity to walk through the Pudding Path and sample different Banana Puddings from seven local non-profits. Complete the Pudding Path and you have eaten almost a pound of Banana Pudding.\n\nOne of the favorite events at the festival is the Individual Pudding Contest. Contestants present their award winning pudding to judges and to the public. The winner of the Georgia State Banana Pudding goes on to the National Banana Pudding Festival in Centerville, TN, to compete for the National title. In 2016, Kelly Crumbley from Forsyth, GA, was the Georgia winner and went on to compete and win at the National Banana Pudding Festival.\n\nNorth Carolina rock band Southern Culture on the Skids throws banana pudding (possibly pudding mix) during live shows and have a song, \"Banana Pudding\", on their \"Plastic Seat Sweat\" album, dedicated to the dessert itself.\n\n"}

They consist (as the name suggests) of raisins coated in a shell of milk, dark or white chocolate. They have a reputation in many countries of being food eaten in movie theaters and are an item familiar from concession counters. Supermarket chains also sell them in bags and they were traditionally sold by weight, from jars, in candy stores.\n\nThe historical origins of the chocolate covered raisin are unknown. However, most early references tend to originate from the Germanic-speaking regions of Europe. A popular folk tale mentions \"kleine Schokokugeln\" (little chocolate balls). Schokokugeln are a popular form of candy treat found widely in modern Germany. A traditional Germanic children's Christmas prayer also contains: \"...Meine kleine Schokokugeln, oh, wie edel man die Früchte hängen nach unten zu verherrlichen. Mein Weinberg weint mit guter Laune an diesem Geschenk des Himmels.\" (...my little chocolate balls, oh, how nobly you glorify the fruit hanging down. My vineyard weeps with good cheer at this gift from heaven.)\nIt is also likely that a precursor form of this food existed in Mesoamerican cultures, given the known consumption of cacao-based foods within these ancient societies, e.g., a chocolate coated nut or berry.\n\nThe raisins are coated with oil and spun in a hot drum filled with chocolate to cover them. A coating of shellac is then usually micro-sprayed onto the surface (typically using a modified Huon-Stuehrer nozzle operating at 60 degrees C / 20-30 psi pressure) to give them their characteristic shiny coating. The size of the finished product is not as uniform as most candy products, due to the inherent variability in size of the underlying raisin. Although size differential is not widely regarded as a significant factor with regard to consumer acceptability, some industry pundits believe this may explain why this type of product, whilst popular enough to continue production, is unlikely to impact on the sales margins of other well established and uniformly-sized confectionery.\n\nIn some countries, they are also known as Raisinets, which is the earliest and one of the most popular brands of the product, currently made by Nestlé. Raisinets were introduced in the United States in 1927 by the Blumenthal Chocolate Company. Nestlé acquired the brand in 1984. A large number of other brands also exist, including:\n\nThe Promotion in Motion Companies, Inc, the candy company that manufactures Welch's Fruit Snacks, also manufactures a Sun-Maid brand of chocolate-covered raisins.\n\nThere is a non-dairy equivalent made of sugar (non-refined), cocoa mass, cocoa butter, raisins and vanillin.\n\nA similar food, also commonly sold at movie theaters, is the chocolate-covered peanut. As described above, the two products are often combined for consumption in a mixture. Less common alternatives are the chocolate-covered almond or the chocolate-covered macadamia.\n\n"}

It has perforations over its surface, as well as a distinctively dry and crisp texture.\n\nSome familiar brand names of saltine crackers in North America are Christie's \"Premium Plus\" (Canada), Nabisco's \"Premium\" (U.S.), Sunshine Biscuits' \"Krispy\" (U.S.), Keebler's \"Zesta\" (U.S.) (both owned by Kellogg's), and Noel's Saltín (Colombia) (owned by Grupo Nutresa). Unsalted tops as well as whole grain saltines can also be found.\n\nSaltines are commonly eaten as a light snack, often with cheese, butter, or peanut butter. They may also be dipped or crumbled in stews, chilis, soups or crumbled into salads. Typically they are sold in boxes containing two to four stacks of crackers, each wrapped in a sleeve of waxed paper or plastic. In restaurants, they are found in small wrapped packets of two crackers, which generally accompany soup or salad. Cracker meal, a type of coarse to semi-fine flour made of crushed saltine crackers, may be used as toppings for dishes; breading for fried or baked red meats, poultry, fish; or as a thickener for soups, stews, sauces, and chilis.\n\nAs a home remedy, saltines are consumed by many people in order to ease nausea and to settle an upset stomach. Saltine crackers have also been included in military field rations (Meal, Ready-to-Eat, or MRE) in the United States. For some children in the eastern United States, Saltines are a traditional Christmas Eve treat.\n\nSoda crackers were described in \"The Young Housekeeper\" by Alcott in 1838.\n\nIn 1876, F. L. Sommer & Company of St. Joseph, Missouri started using baking soda to leaven its wafer thin cracker. Initially called the Premium Soda Cracker and later \"Saltines\" because of the baking salt component, the invention quickly became popular and Sommer's business quadrupled within four years. That company merged with other companies to form American Biscuit Company in 1890 and then after further mergers became part of Nabisco in 1898.\n\nIn the early 20th century, various companies in the United States began selling soda crackers in Puerto Rico and referred to them as \"Export Soda\". Rovira Biscuit Corp. of Puerto Rico also started selling their soda crackers with the same name. The term \"Export Soda\" became a generic term in Puerto Rico for these crackers. In 1975 Keebler Co. was refused a trademark for the term because it was \"merely descriptive\".\n\nIn the United States, Nabisco lost trademark protection after the term \"saltine\" began to be used generically to refer to similar crackers (see generic trademark for how this occurs). The name \"saltine\" had been placed in the \"Merriam Webster Dictionary\" in 1907 with a definition of \"a thin crisp cracker usually sprinkled with salt”. In Australia, Arnott's Biscuits Holdings still holds a trademark on the name \"Saltine\".\n\nThey were made in the United Kingdom by Huntley and Palmers, and also in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name Arnott's Salada.\n\nSaltines have been compared to hardtack, a simple unleavened cracker or biscuit made from flour, water, and sometimes salt. However, unlike hardtack, saltines include yeast as one of their ingredients. Soda crackers are a leavened bread that is allowed to rise for twenty to thirty hours. After the rise, alkaline soda is added to neutralize the excessive acidity produced by the action of the yeast. The dough is allowed to rest for three to four more hours, to relax the gluten, before being rolled in layers and then baked.\n\nFlat saltine crackers have perforations on their surfaces. During baking, the outer layer of dough hardens first, restricting out-gassing of evolved gasses. The perforations connect the top surface to the bottom surface to prevent the cracker from pillowing as a result of these evolved gasses.\n\n\n"}

The identity of the gift giver is a secret not to be revealed until after the gift is opened. \n\nDeriving from the Christian tradition, the ritual is known as \"Secret Santa\" in the United States and the United Kingdom; as \"Kris Kringel\" or \"Kris Kindle\" (\"Christkindl\") in Ireland; as \"Wichteln, Secret Santa\", \"Kris Kringle\", \"Chris Kindle\" (\"Christkindl\") or Engerl-Bengerl in parts of Austria; as \"Secret Santa\" or \"Kris Kringle\" in Canada and Australia; as \"Secret Santa\", \"Kris Kringle\", or \"Manita-Manito\" in the Philippines; as \"Angelito\" in the Dominican Republic; and as \"Wichteln\" or \"Julklapp\" in Germany. \"Wichteln\" is what a \"Wichtel\", a wight, does, a good deed. In Poland, the tradition is celebrated on the day of 6 December (Mikołajki), in Ukraine — on December, 19th (Mykolay). All of these names derive from traditional Christmas gift-bringers: the American custom is named after Santa Claus, or St Nicholas (Poland and Ukraine), while \"Chris Kindle\" and \"Kris Kringle\" are both corruptions of the original name of the Austrian gift-bringer \"Christkindl\", which means the \"Christ Child\". Exceptions are the UK (where the traditional gift-bringer is Father Christmas) and the Philippines (which has the Three Kings).

This letter may or may not have hints on who the giver might be, depending on the rules participants have established. Each receiver must guess who made the gift.\n\nIn this version, each person buys a gift for specific amount, not for anyone specifically. Each person also puts in a specific amount of money into a pot. Who goes first in gift selection can be determined by random selection. The options are:\n\n\nAt the end, the gifts that were chosen are opened and the winner of the money and leftover gifts are drawn.\n\nIn this version, participants engage in a \"conspiracy\" where all participants work together to select a gift for a single participant without that participant's direct involvement or knowledge. Many such individual \"conspiracies\" run concurrently, one for each participant. Email threads or web apps are commonly used to manage each \"conspiracy\" until a consensus is made, wherein the gift is purchased by a decided upon participant and given at a later date. A common theme of Conspiracy Santa is collectively learning about participants, making it popular for workplaces and schools.\n\nThe tradition of Secret Santa is becoming increasingly popular in online communities.\n\nOn the one hand there are several \"Secret Santa Generators\" that tell every participant in a group for whom to buy a gift. This is especially useful for groups who can't meet in person to draw the names from a hat or bowl before the Secret Santa event. Popular \"Secret Santa Generators\" are:\nOn the other hand there are communities like redditgifts where you don't know the person for whom you buy a gift or from whom you receive a gift.\n"}

Pronouncing the letters and numbers may sound similar to the full word: \"K9\" for \"canine\" (phonetically: \"kay\" + \"nine\").\n\nAlternatively, the letters between the first and last are replaced with a number representing the number of letters omitted, such as \"i18n\" for \"internationalization\". Sometimes the last letter is also counted and omitted. These word shortenings are sometimes called \"alphanumeric acronyms\", \"alphanumeric abbreviations\", or \"numerical contractions\".\n\nAccording to Tex Texin, the first numeronym of this kind was \"S12n\", the electronic mail account name given to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) employee Jan Scherpenhuizen by a system administrator because his surname was too long to be an account name. By 1985, colleagues who found Jan's name unpronounceable often referred to him verbally as \"S12n\" (\"ess-twelve-en\"). The use of such numeronyms became part of DEC corporate culture.\n\nA number may also denote how many times the character before or after it is repeated. This is typically used to represent a name or phrase in which several consecutive words start with the same letter, as in W3 (World Wide Web) or W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).\n\nSome numeronyms are composed entirely of numbers, such as \"212\" for \"New Yorker\", \"4-1-1\" for \"information\", \"9-1-1\" for \"help\", and \"101\" for \"basic introduction to a subject\". Words of this type have existed for decades, including those in 10-code, which has been in use since before World War II.\n\nChapter or title numbers of some jurisdictions' statutes have become numeronyms, for example 5150 and 187 from California's penal code. Largely because the production of many American movies and television programs are based in California, usage of these terms has spread beyond its original location and user population.\n\nThe concept of incorporating numbers into words can also be found in Leet-speak, where numbers are frequently substituted for orthographically similar letters (e.g. \"H4CK3D\" for \"HACKED\").\n\nAnne H. Soukhanov, editor of the new \"Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary\", gives the original meaning of the term as \"a telephone number that spells a word or a name\" on a telephone dial.\n\nWhere words have multiple meanings, abbreviations such as these are almost always used to refer to their computing sense; for example, \"G11n\" for \"globalization\" refers to software preparedness for global distribution, and not the social trend of globalization. In some cases, the use of appropriate case makes it easier to distinguish between letters such as uppercase I/i and lower case L/l.\n\n"}

Screaming Yellow Zonkers are popcorn with a yellow sugary glaze, in a black box.\n\nIn 1968 Lincoln Snacks had developed a product similar to their other popcorn products, Fiddle Faddle and Poppycock. At the time they had no name for it and no concept for promoting it, so executives went to Chicago and opened the door to the major ad agencies to pitch their ideas. A small, boutique agency, Hurvis, Binzer & Churchill won the account by naming the product \"Screaming Yellow Zonkers\" and presenting it in a black package with \"crazy\" copy and illustrations on every panel. Lincoln Snacks asserts that SYZs were the first food item to be packaged in black. \n\nThe box contained humorous copy, such as suggestions about what to do with Screaming Yellow Zonkers, or that 8 oz. (226g) = 1/4,409 of a metric ton. (This comic content was provided by Allan Katz and Howie Kraków who wrote the copy on the first several boxes, and the award-winning TV and radio campaigns.) The box was designed by Rollin Binzer, co-owner and creative director of HBC. \n\nZonkers were geared toward those who enjoy sweetened popcorn without nuts, as opposed to products like Cracker Jack. Screaming Yellow Zonkers were kosher, but did contain dairy products.\n\nWhile the front of the package was simple and understated, the rest of the Zonkers box was completely covered with absurdist copy, accompanied by illustrations, informing the reader everything from \"how to wash Zonkers\" to \"how to mate them\". The bottom of the box explained how to determine if it were indeed the bottom: “Open the top, and turn the box upside down. If the Zonkers fall out, this is the bottom. If they fall up, this is the top. If nothing happens, this box is empty.”\n\nWorld-class illustrators became a part of the Zonkers phenomenon. Airbrush artist Charlie White illustrated the front of the Circus box while Seymour Chwast’s work decorated the rest. White also illustrated a giant Zonkers circus poster, inspired by more of Katz’s copy. The poster was offered on the circus box for \"$2.95 to include shipping, handling, and profit.\" The circus box ended up being displayed in the Louvre in Paris.\n\nThe product was discontinued after Conagra acquired Lincoln Foods in 2007. However, as of May 2012, Conagra is producing them on a limited edition basis for Walgreens.\n"}

Malvan is a town in the Sindhudurg district on the west coast of Maharashtra.\n\nMalvani cuisine uses coconut liberally in various forms such as grated, dry-grated, fried, coconut paste and coconut milk. Many masalas have dried red chilies and other spices like coriander seeds, peppercorns, cumin, cardamom, ginger and garlic. Some dishes also use kokum, dried kokam (amsul), tamarind, and raw mango (kairi). The Malvani masala, a form of dried powder masala, is a combination of 15 to 16 dry spices. This masala is coarsely ground and stored in jars to be utilized when required.

Noodles were introduced into the Philippines early on by Chinese Filipino settlers in the archipelago, and over the centuries have been fully adopted into local cuisine, of which there are now numerous variants and types. The term \"pancit\" is derived from the Hokkien \"pian i sit\" ( or ) which literally means \"convenient food.\" Different kinds of noodles can be found in Filipino supermarkets which can then be cooked at home. Noodle dishes are also standard fare in local restaurants. Food establishments specializing in noodles are often referred to as \"panciterias\".\n\nNancy Reyes Lumen of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism writes that according to food lore handed down from the Chinese, noodles should be eaten on one's birthday. They are therefore commonly served at birthday celebrations and Chinese restaurants in the Philippines often have \"birthday noodles\" listed on their menus. However, she warns that since \"noodles represent long life and good health\", they must not be cut, as that would \"corrupt the symbolism.\"\n\nPancit is a derivative of a type of noodle(s) that originated in China but pancit which is different in its own aspect originated in the Philippines. The fact that pancit is eaten and part of Filipino culture means that it was most likely brought over from settlers originating in China or East Asia.\n\n\"Pancit luglug\", a Kapampangan version of \"pancit palabok\", are essentially similar dishes, the difference being primarily in the noodles used in the recipe. \"Luglog\" uses a thicker noodle than the traditional \"bihon\" of a \"pancit palabok\" and usually has less condiments and relish on top.

Considerations to be aware of when bandaging include:\n\n\nBandages should typically be changed every 12 hours. When a poultice is used, it is best to clean the leg with soap and water after removal, before re-applying a clean bandage.\n\nBefore a wound dressing is applied, the injury should be cleaned, and it should be recleaned between bandage cycles. The wrapping of the padding and bandage should be in the direction that best supports the closure of the wound. Gauze should be used between the padding and the leg injury.\n\n"}

There is also a local variety called Slovak kulen made predominately in Bačka by local Slovaks.\n\nA kind of kulen from Slavonia has had its designation of origin protected in Croatia by an organization from Bošnjaci. In parts of Slavonia, kulen is called \"kulin\" in Ikavian accent.\n\nCroatian Baranya Kulen (Baranjski Kulen) is protected by Geographical Indication (GI) status from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nThe meat is low-fat, rather brittle and dense, and the flavour is spicy with the hot red paprika bringing it aroma and colour, and garlic for additional spice. The original kulen recipe does not contain black pepper; its hot flavour comes from the paprika.\n\nThe traditional time of producing kulen is during the pig slaughter done every autumn by most households. Kulen matures during the winter; it can be eaten at this time, although not fully dried and cured yet, with very hot taste, but it will develop its full taste by the following summer. To produce a dryer, firmer kulen, it is sometimes kept buried under ashes, which act as a desiccant. Kulen is a shelf-stable meat product, with a shelf life of up to two years when stored properly.\n\nThe meat is stuffed and pressed into bags made of pork intestine, and formed into links that are usually around ten centimetres in diameter, and up to three times as long, weighing around a kilogram.\n\nThe pieces of kulen are smoked for several months, using certain types of wood. After the smoking they are air-dried for another several months. This process can last up to a year. Although similar to other air-dried procedures, the meat is fermented in addition to the air-drying. High-grade kulen is sometimes even covered with a thin layer of mould, giving it a distinct aroma.\n\nWhen the kulen meat is stuffed into the small intestine, the thinness makes it require less smoking and drying and thus also takes less time to mature. This type of sausage is often referred to as \"kulenova seka\" (literally \"kulen's sister\").\n\nKulen is regarded as a premium domestically-made dried meat product, given that on the Zagreb market even a low-grade kulen can cost much more than other types of sausages and is comparable to smoked ham. Although it has also been produced commercially throughout former Yugoslavia since World War II, the industrial process of production is significantly different, resulting in major differences in appearance and aroma, although it is cheap compared to the genuine kulen. However an annual \"Kulenijada\" festival is held in many Croatian and Serbian cities to honor the history and great regional masters of making kulen.\n\n"}

By the 16th century Christmas biscuits had become popular across Europe, with \"Lebkuchen\" being favoured in Germany and \"pepparkakor\" in Sweden, while in Norway \"krumkake\" were popular.\n\nThe earliest examples of Christmas cookies in the United States were brought by the Dutch in the early 17th century. Due to a wide range of cheap imported products from Germany between 1871 and 1906 following a change to importation laws, cookie cutters became available in American markets. These imported cookie cutters often depicted highly stylised images with subjects designed to hang on Christmas trees. Due to the availability of these utensils, recipes began to appear in cookbooks designed to use them. In the early 20th century, U.S. merchants were also importing decorated Lebkuchen cookies from Germany to be used as presents.\n\nIn Canada and the United States, since the 1930s, children have left cookies and milk on a table for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, though many people simply consume the cookies themselves. The cookies are often cut into the shape of candy canes, reindeer, holly leaves, Christmas trees, stars, or angels.\n\nGingerbread has existed in some form since sugars and spices were brought back to Europe, from soldiers in the Crusades. However, it was not until Queen Victoria and Prince Albert included it with a variety of other German Christmas traditions that the gingerbread cookies became primarily associated with Christmas. Gingerbread cookies are also traditional in Alsace.\n\nBredala are Christmas cookies in Alsatian cuisine of France.\n\nA traditional cookie which dates from the Middle ages in Norway, \"Fattigmann\" cookies are deep fried in unsalted fat.\n\nKerstkransjes are traditional Christmas cookies from the Netherlands. They are round with a hole in the middle. The most usual type uses almond chips as decoration.\n\n\"Krumkaker\" are traditional cookies from Norway. They were originally baked over open fires using decorative irons; however modern cooks use electric or stovetop irons to bake these wafer-thin biscuits. \"Krumkaker\" owe their name, which means \"bent cake\" or \"twisted cake\", to the fact that they are wrapped in a cone shape.\n\n\"Pepparkakor\" are crisp, thin gingersnap biscuits from Sweden, traditionally cut out in flower and heart shapes.\n\n\"Pfeffernüsse\" originate in Scandinavia and date from medieval times when spices were used exclusively in holiday baking.\n\n\"Repostería\" is a Mexican type of shortbread-like cookie that's lightly baked and dipped into a cinnamon sugar blend until the cinnamon sugar surrounds the cookie. These are often served with coffee or hot spiced Mexican chocolate.\n\n\"Sandbakelse\" are sugar cookies from nineteenth century Norway. The dough is pressed into tins, and then baked in an oven.\n\n\"Springerle\" have been traditional Christmas cookies in south Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg) and Austria for centuries. They are anise-flavored cookies made from an egg-flour-sugar dough. They are usually made in simple shapes, such as rectangles or circles.\n\nAfter shaping, they usually have a picture or design pressed into the soft dough with specially carved rolling pins or presses. After they are baked, the designs are sometimes colored if the intention is to use the cookies as decorations.\n\nAlso called Amish sugar cookies or Nazareth sugar cookies, the modern sugar cookie was created by the Moravians, who settled in the Nazareth area from Germany during the mid-18th century. Pennsylvania adopted the Nazareth sugar cookie as the official state cookie in 2001.\n\n"}

Headquartered in Pennsauken, NJ JJSF uses over 175 facilities for manufacturing, warehousing, and distributing located in 44 states, Mexico and Canada. The company is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as “JJSF”, and serves both nation and international markets.\n\nJJSF's portfolio of products include soft pretzels, frozen beverages, frozen juice treats and desserts, stuffed sandwiches, burritos, churros, fruit pies, funnel cakes, cookies and bakery goods, and other snack foods and drinks. JJSF has a total of 25 brands with its principal brands in these product arenas are SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzels, PRETZEL FILLERS, ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE, ARCTIC BLAST, TIO PEPE CHURROS, CALIFORNIA CHURROS, FUNNEL CAKE FACTORY FUNNEL CAKES, LUIGI’S REAL ITALIAN ICE, DADDY RAY’S fruit bars. and PHILLY SWIRL, WHOLE FRUIT, and MINUTE MAID frozen novelties.\n\nSince the company's CEO's, Gerald B. Shreiber, purchase of J&J Soft Pretzel company in 1971 it has seen 44 years of consecutive sales growth. This growth can be attributed to a strategy that emphasizes active development of new and innovative products, penetration into existing market channels and expansion of established products into new markets. The company is structured in three business groups: Food Service, Frozen Beverages, and Retail Supermarket.\n\nIn 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store's owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court's bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100. The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales. In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF. In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.\n\nIn 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE's Churros. A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing. In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF's list of facilities.\n\nBy 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF's business outside the foodservice segment. As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”. In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik. One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages. Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co. The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.\n\nIn the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993. The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category. The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand. The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels. In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish's International Foods in 1997. The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company's presence in the baked goods category.\n\nAmong these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category's success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date. Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name. This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.\n\nAt the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales. From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels. Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana's IndulgenceCookies acquisition. Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B's Biscuits and Daddy Ray's Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively. In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category. Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007. In 2007 the company acquired Daddy Ray's in Moscow Mills, Missouri.\n\nBy 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million. In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro. A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros. In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra's Frozen Handheld Business. In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott's Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013. In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl. This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.\n\nJJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.\n\nCertain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.\n\nAll of JJSF's soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.\n\nIn the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.\n\nJJSF's frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.\n\nMINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.\n\nThe majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.\n\nJJSF's churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.\n\nJJSF's dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.\n\nJJSF's bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S, DADDY RAY’S, and as of August 2017, LABRIOLA, brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.\n\nJJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials.

The tail is considered offal, nicknamed in Rome the \"quinto quarto\" 'the fifth fourth'.\n\nThe oxtail is parboiled and then simmered with large amounts of celery (typically 1.5 kilo of celery for every kilo of tail), carrots, and aromatic herbs. Tomatoes and red wine are added, and then the mixture is cooked further with a soffritto of onions, garlic, prosciutto, pancetta and some other ingredients. During the final phase of cooking, a bouquet garni of bay leaves, celery stalks, and cloves is put in the pot for flavouring. It is cooked until the meat easily separates from the bones. It is seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper and garnished with pine nuts.\n\n\"Coda\" is usually prepared to taste sweet-and-sour, usually using raisins, or sometimes candied fruit or a small amount of grated bittersweet chocolate.

The southern flavor of Chinese sausage is commonly known by its Cantonese name 'lap ceung' (or 'lap chong') ().\n\nThere is a choice of fatty or lean sausages. There are different kinds ranging from those made using fresh pork to those made using pig livers, duck livers and even turkey livers. Usually a sausage made with liver will be darker in color than one made without liver. Recently, there have even been countries producing chicken Chinese sausages. Traditionally they are classified into two main types. It is sometimes rolled and steamed in dim sum.\n\nChinese sausage is used as an ingredient in quite a number of dishes in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan, and also Hong Kong. Sichuan sausage also contains red chili powder, Sichuan pepper powder, and Pixian bean sauce, to characterise the sausage with a special flavour. Two common examples of such dishes include fried rice and \"lo mai gai\" (糯米雞). The traditional unpackaged forms are usually found in street markets or wet markets.\n\nWing Wah is a famous Hong Kong company that produces Chinese sausages.\n\nIn northeast China, especially Heilongjiang's largest city Harbin, Hongchang (), a popular regional speciality, is smoked savory red sausage, similar to Lithuanian and German sausages and mild Russian sausages with more \"European\" flavours than other Chinese sausages. It was first manufactured in March 1909 by Lithuanian staff in a Russian-capitalized factory named Churin Sausage Factory, located in Harbin's Daoli District. Harbin-style sausage subsequently became popular in China, especially in northern regions. A sweeter dried version similar to southern Chinese sausages is also produced.\n\nIn Vietnamese, Chinese sausage is called ' or '. It has been incorporated into a variety of dishes from simple omelets to more complex main courses. Due to the salty taste of the sausages, they are used in moderation with other ingredients to balance the flavor. The sausages are made from pork (') or chicken ('), the latter of which yields a leaner taste.\n\nIn Burmese, the sausage is called either ' (chicken sausage; ) or ' (pork sausage; ). The sausages made in Myanmar are more meaty and compact compared to those in Singapore or China. They are usually used in fried rice and along with fried vegetables, mostly cabbage.\n\nIn the Philippines, Chinese sausage is an ingredient in some Chinese-Filipino dishes like \"siopao bola-bola\". It is sometimes confused with and used in place of the native sausage \"Chorizo de Macao\" (which is also sometimes known as \"Chinese chorizo\"). The latter is not derived from the Chinese sausage, but derives its name from the use of star anise, which is associated with Chinese cuisine in the Philippines.\n\nSingapore produces innovative Chinese sausages that are healthier than the traditional variety. Examples include low-fat, low-sodium, and high-fibre Chinese sausages.\n\nTaiwan also produces a similar form of sausage; however, they are rarely dried in the manner of Cantonese sausages. The fat and meat may be emulsified, and a larger amount of sugar may be used, yielding a sweeter taste. These sausages are usually produced by local butchers and sold at markets or made directly at home. This variant of Chinese sausage is known as \" () in Mandarin Chinese, literally meaning fragrant sausage.\n\nIn Thai, Chinese sausage is called ' () after its name in the Teochew dialect (' in Teochew), the dominant Chinese language within the Thai Chinese community. It is used in several Chinese dishes by the sizeable Thai Chinese community, and also in some Thai dishes such as \", a Thai salad made with this sausage.\nThere is also Chinese sausage made with snakehead fish (\"; ).\n\nIn Suriname, Chinese sausage is referred to by a Hakka Chinese word rendered as \"fatjong\", \"fachong\"\n\n\"fa-chong\", \"fashong\", or \"fasjong\" in colloquial spelling. It is part of the dish \"moksi meti tyawmin\" (mixed meat chow mein).\n\nChinese sausages are generally available in Asian supermarkets outside Asia, mostly in a vacuum-packaged form, although some Chinese groceries sell the unpackaged varieties as well. These tend to be made locally; for example, many of the Chinese sausages sold in Canada are produced by a number of manufacturers based in Vancouver and Toronto. \"Lap cheong\" is also a very popular sausage in Hawaii due to large numbers of Chinese in Hawaii who have incorporated it into local cuisine.\n\n"}

The brand was founded by Roustam Tariko in 1998.\n\nThe brand was introduced as the \"Russian Standard\" vodka in 1998 by the Russian Standard company of Roustam Tariko. The \"Russian Standard\", later called \"Original\", vodka established the brand as one of the top premium vodka brands in the Russian market. Its new \"Russian\", Soviet-free identity, turned (unusually for a premium beverage) an advantage in the rapidly developing market of the 1990s Russia.\n\nTwo years after a successful Russian market launch, international expansion was started. This was accompanied by the launch of \"Russian Standard Platinum\" product in 2001 and the luxury brand \"Imperia\" in 2004. The original product was re-christened \"Original\".\n\nIn 2006, a new distillery with 4 million cases/yr capacity was opened in Saint Petersburg.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, in 2001 the brand was active worldwide in 80+ markets with sales over 2 million cases/yr.\nMarketing emphasizes the 100% Russian mantra – being produced by a Russian recipe, from only Russian raw materials, distilled and bottled in Russia.\n\nRussian Standard aroused controversy when it questioned the Russianness of its chief international rival Stolichnaya. At that time, Stolichnaya was distilled in Russia but bottled in Latvia. Stolichnaya distributor, Pernod Ricard, responded by insisting that Stolichnaya is an authentic Russian vodka, as nothing is added or removed during the bottling.\n\nIn a 2006 overview of Russian premium vodkas for \"Vanity Fair\", the \"Imperia\" product stood alone with a top A+ grade.\n\nProduction of the Russian Standard Original is based on a four-tier protocol:\nHigher-end products add more purification steps.\n\nWinter grain from Russian steppes are milled and fermented. The raw spirit is distilled four times for the \"Original\", six times for \"Platinum\", while the \"Imperia\" spirit is distilled eight times.\n\nThe spirits are blended with water from Lake Ladoga. The proximity of Lake Ladoga was one of the main reasons for the company's decision to establish its distillery in Saint Petersburg. The lake's underground sources provide one of the softest waters naturally available. \n\nThe product is then filtered four times through charcoal. \"Platinum\" receives two more filtrations through silver and \"Imperia\" two more filtrations through quartz from the Ural Mountains.\n\nAfter final filtration, the spirits spend 48 hours in relaxation tanks, are bottled and packaged. As vodka contains only water and ethanol, it generally does not mature or age and its shelf life is limited only by packaging.\n\nThe marketing claims that, \"\"In 1894, Dmitri Mendeleev, the greatest scientist in all Russia, received the decree to set the Imperial quality standard for Russian vodka and the 'Russian Standard' was born\"\", or that the vodka is \"\"compliant with the highest quality of Russian vodka approved by the royal government commission headed by Mendeleev in 1894.\"\"\n\nThis, however, is based on a popular myth that Mendeleev's 1865 doctoral dissertation \"A Discourse on the combination of alcohol and water\" contained a statement that 38% is the ideal strength of vodka, and that this number was later rounded to 40% to simplify the calculation of alcohol tax. However, Mendeleev's dissertation was about alcohol concentrations over 70% and he never wrote anything about vodka. Furthermore, the 40% standard strength was introduced by the Russian government already in 1843, when Mendeleev was nine years old.\n\n\n"}

From the part of the rider it needs \"much practice in collecting and balancing the horse and in using the aids correctly.\"\nThe horse may perform the movement at the walk or canter, although the pirouette at the walk is more commonly called the turn on the haunches. It \"can also be executed at piaffe.\"\n\nAs in all dressage, the horse should remain relaxed, engaged, and responsive, with the poll as the highest point.

This often makes the hairy appearance of the grass synfloresce. Awns may be long (several centimeters) or short, straight or curved, single or multiple per floret. Some genera are named after their awns, such as the three-awns (\"Aristida\").\n\nIn some species, the awns can contribute significantly to photosynthesis, as, for example, in barley.\n\nThe awns of wild emmer wheat spikelets effectively self-cultivate by propelling themselves mechanically into soils. During a period of increased humidity during the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil. During the daytime the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine silica hairs on the awns act as ratchet hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from reversing back out again. During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming frog kick, drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil.\n\nWhen awns occur in the Geraniaceae, they form the distal (rostral) points of the five carpels, lying parallel in the style above the ovary. Depending on the species, such awns have various seed dispersal functions, either dispersing the seed by flinging it out (seed ejection); flinging away the entire carpel so that it snaps off (carpel projection); entangling the awn or bristles on passing animals (zoochory); or possibly burying the seed by twisting as it lies on soft soil.\n"}

The delicacy is often featured in Mediterranean cuisine and consumed in many other regions of the world. The food bears many different names and is prepared in several different ways.\n\nThe product is similar to karasumi, the softer cured mullet roe from Japan, and to \"guneoran\", the cured mullet or freshwater drum from Korea. It is known as \"batarekh\" in Egypt, where the word is known to originate from the Coptic language.\n\nThe English name, \"bottarga\", was borrowed from Italian. The Italian form is thought to have been introduced from the Arabic \"buṭarḫah\" بطارخة (plural \"buṭariḫ\" بطارخ), also derives from Byzantine Greek (\"oiotárikhon\") < 'egg' + τάριχον 'pickled'.\n\nThe Italian form can be dated to ca. 1500, since the Greek form transliterated into Latin as \"ova tarycha\" occurs in Bartolomeo Platina's \"De Honesta Voluptate\" (ca. 1474), the earliest printed cookbook, and an Italian manuscript dating shortly afterward that \"closely parallels\" this cookbook attests to \"botarghe\" in the corresponding passage. The first mention of the Greek form (\"oiotárikhon\") occurs in the eleventh century in the writings of Simeon Seth, who denounced the food as something to be \"avoided totally\", although a similar phrase may have been in use since antiquity in the same denotation.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Coptic \"outarakhon\" might be the intermediate form between Greek and Arabic, whereas examination of dialectical variants of Greek 'egg' include Pontic Greek \"ὠβόν\" (traditionally where the mullets are caught) and ὀβό or βό in parts of Asia Minor. The modern Greek name comes from the Byzantine Greek, substituting the modern word αυγό for the ancient word .\n\nBottarga is made chiefly from the roe pouch of grey mullet. Sometimes it is prepared from Atlantic bluefin tuna (\"bottarga di tonno rosso\") or yellowfin tuna. It is massaged by hand to eliminate air pockets, then dried and cured in sea salt for a few weeks. The result is a hard, dry slab that sometimes is coated in beeswax for preservation purposes. Not all bottarga is coated in beeswax as some producers simply keep intact the natural casing of the roe, which contains the eggs securely once dried and salted. The curing time may vary depending on the producer and the desired texture as well as the preference of the consumers, which varies by country.\n\nSometimes called the caviar of the south, bottarga usually is sliced thinly or grated when it is served. The delicacy currently is served in many regions, including the following.\n\nIn Croatia, the delicacy is known as butarga or butarda. It is usually fried before serving.\n\nIn the French region, Provence, it is named \"poutargue\" and produced in the city of Martigues. It also may be called boutargue in France.\n\nIn Greece, avgotaraho is produced primarily from the flathead mullet caught in Greek lagoons. The whole mature ovaries are removed from the fish, washed with water, salted with natural sea salt, dried under the sun, and sealed in melted beeswax.\n\nAvgotaraho Messolonghiou, made from fish caught in the Messolonghi-Etoliko Lagoons is a European and Greek protected designation of origin, one of the few seafood products with a PDO.\n\nIn Italy, it is best known in Sicilian cuisine as bottarga. In Sardinia, it is known as butàriga in Sardinian language; its culinary properties may be compared to those of dry anchovies, although it is much more expensive. Often, it is served with olive oil or lemon juice as an appetizer accompanied by bread or crostini. It is also used in pasta dishes.\n\nBottarga is categorized as a Traditional food product (prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale). It varies by region, in particular, is produced in Sardinia from flathead mullet and in Sicily from Bluefin tuna.\n\nBottarga is produced in Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nIn Turkey, bottarga is made from grey mullet roe. It is listed in the Ark of Taste. It is produced in Dalyan, on the southwestern coast of Turkey, from the mature fish migrating from Lake Köyceğiz.\n\nBottarga in Spain is produced and consumed mainly in the country's southeastern region, in the Autonomous Community of Murcia and the province of Alicante. It is usually made from a variety of roes including, among others, grey mullet, tuna, bonito, or even black drum or common ling (the latter two somewhat cheaper and less valued). Much of its production is centered around the town of San Pedro del Pinatar, to the shores of the Mar Menor, where there are also salt ponds.\n\nThe Anna Maria Fish Company in the Cortez Fishing Village located in Manatee County, Florida alongside a recently established and growing company named, \"Gulf Coast Caviar\" also located in Sarasota, Florida processes grey mullet roe into its bottarga that they sell locally, ship internationally, and make available to a few restaurants in the Gulf of Mexico region near Sarasota Bay. The county tourist bureau states that the process of making bottarga was depicted in Ancient Egyptian murals and that documentation from the 1500s exists that the Native Americans along the western coast of Florida were consuming dried mullet roe when encountered by European explorers.\n\nOther locations in Florida also process bottarga.\n\nHrogn AS from the Arctic Norwegian town of Tromsø is an innovative artisanal producer of bottarga made from north-Atlantic cod (Gadus Morhua). The production is done by hand and the bottarga is left to dry outside during the cold winter months on the Norwegian dry-racks traditionally used for stockfish.

Gyūtan was initially considered a rather unusual dish, but gradually gained popularity throughout Japan, partially because white collar workers who were transferred from Sendai spread its reputation to other cities.\n\nGyūtan restaurants received a boost in 1991, when Japan's import quotas for beef were eliminated. In 2003, the Japanese government temporarily banned American beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered in the country. This was a devastating blow for many gyūtan restaurants. For example, 90% of the beef tongues used in gyūtan restaurants in Sendai were imported from the U.S. Additionally, some connoisseurs claim that U.S. beef contains the ideal amount of fat for gyūtan dishes and refuse to use Australian beef.\n\nMuch of the content of this article comes from the equivalent Japanese-language Wikipedia article (retrieved September 21, 2005).

It was hand carved by convicts in 1810, for Elizabeth Macquarie, the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales. The peninsula itself is named Mrs Macquarie's Point, and is part of The Domain, near the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\nMrs Macquarie was the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. Folklore has it that she used to sit on the rock and watch for ships from Great Britain sailing into the harbour. She was known to visit the area and sit enjoying the panoramic views of the harbour. \n\nAbove the chair is a stone inscription referring to Mrs Macquarie's Road. That road was built between 1813 and 1818, and ran from the original Government House (now the Museum of Sydney) to Mrs Macquarie's Point. It was built on the instruction of Governor Macquarie for the benefit of his wife. There is no remaining evidence of the original road, other than a culvert over which the road ran—the Macquarie Culvert.\n\nThe stone inscription reads as follows.\nThe peninsula sits between the Garden Island peninsula to the east and Bennelong Point (where the Sydney Opera House resides) to the west. The chair itself faces north-east towards Fort Denison and the Tasman Sea. The area around it on Mrs Macquarie's Point is a popular lookout position for the view to the north-west of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n"}

In Hakka, some might call it Man-Foon-Char-Guo (麵粉茶粿) or Dao-Ma-Chet (刀嬤切).\n\nIn Hokkien, it was called \"Mee-Hoon-Kueh\" (麵粉粿; lit. \"wheat snack\") but what can be found at hawker stalls is generally called \"banmian\". The current style is a mix between the traditional methods of Hakka and Hokkien. The Hakka initially made the noodle by shaving pieces off a block of dough, commonly made from flour (sometimes egg is added for more flavor), while the Hokkien would roll the dough into a large, flat piece that would then be torn by hand into bite-sized bits. Traditionally, the dough is hand-kneaded and torn into smaller pieces of dough (about 2 inches). The dough can also be kneaded using machine into a variety of shapes, the most common shape being flat strips of noodle.\n\nBanmian is a culinary dish that is popular in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. It consists of egg noodles served in a flavorful soup, often with some type of meat or fish, vegetables and various spices. Dried anchovies, minced pork, mushrooms, and a leafy vegetable such as sweet potato leaves or sayur manis (sauropus androgynus) are also possible ingredients. \n\nThe meal is considered one of the healthier food choices and can be found for sale by restaurants, street vendors and food stalls in the region. The base of the entire meal is a soup, so there are numerous variations in ingredients, stocks and noodle shapes. In many instances, the completed soup is topped with an egg that is cooked in the hot liquid above the noodles.\n\nMost versions of banmian use egg noodles that are simply a blend of egg, flour, water and salt that is kneaded and then formed into noodles. However, the modern day banmian is mainly made by using a pasta maker which cuts noodles in all sizes. \n\nThe base of the soup can be water but is more commonly a type of fish stock. Normal fish stock can be used, but anchovy stock is a common choice. Various ingredients, such as onions, garlic, ginger and bean paste, also can be added to the stock to provide more flavor, although some preparations are so simple that nothing more than plain stock is used. In Malaysia, dry noodles and soup are served separately.\n\nDry chilli pan mee is also becoming popular, especially in the Klang Valley. This dry noodle is served with minced pork, fried onions, anchovies, and topped with a poached egg which is later to be stirred into the noodles. Dry chilli mix (or sambal) is also served with it.\n\nTwo common ingredients that are often found across different versions of banmian are mushrooms and anchovies. The exact type of each might vary, but they are generally added to the stock base. The mushrooms can be dried and are reconstituted in the broth, while the anchovies could be fried until crispy and then served on top of the soup. The anchovies also can be added to the stock for flavor and allowed to break down as it cooks.\n\nOnce the base stock is completed, nearly anything can be added to complete the banmian. This includes vegetables such as green onions, spinach, cabbage and bamboo shoots. Some vinegar is usually added, occasionally with sugar to balance the flavor. Restaurants may offer minced pork that has been fried or chunks of white fish to act as a protein-rich addition to the soup. Finally, an egg is cracked into the hot broth and allowed to cook until the whites are set and the yolk is warmed through.\n\n"}

While customary on bread, they are traditionally eaten on \"beschuit\", or rusk. Muisjes are made of aniseeds with a sugared and colored outer layer. They are currently only produced by the Dutch food processing company , a brand acquired by Heinz in 2001.\n\nIt's uncertain why the name \"little mice\" was chosen. It may have been that the stem of the seed reminded people of a mouse's tail, or it may have been that the mouse's fast reproductive cycle was further used as symbolism for healthy childbirth. In belgium it refers to droppings of the mice\n\nIn the Netherlands, it customary at the birth of a baby to eat muisjes on top of rusk—\"beschuit met muisjes\" (\"met\" meaning \"with\"); the anise in the muisjes symbolized fertility and was thought to stimulate lactation and to restore the uterus to its former size. Beschuit with muisjes is typically brought by older siblings to share with classmates at school or by parents to share with colleagues at work.\n\nThe exact origin of giving away muisjes is unknown, but likely stems from traditions dating back to the Middle Ages. Because childbirth used to be very dangerous for women, births without complications were celebrated extensively. A treat—usually something sweet—was given to visitors as a supposed \"gift\" from the newborn child. Muisjes started being produced in the Netherlands in the 18th century, and replaced sugar as the favourite topping used on beschuit to symbolise successful childbirth. However, beschuit was quite expensive at the time and mostly reserved for festivities organised by the wealthy, so most people instead ate sugary white bread until beschuit became cheaper. When pink muisjes were introduced in 1860, they became the standard with births of female babies while the original white muisjes remained in use with male ones. With the introduction of blue muisjes in 1994, blue has become the standard with boys instead.\n\nDe Ruijter is currently the largest brand in production of muisjes and has been producing them since 1860. The company managed to repopularize the dish when in 1938 the Dutch royal family was given a large can of orange muisjes (orange is the color of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau) in celebration of the birth of princess Beatrix. Orange muisjes were again sold for only one week in December 2003, in honour of the birth of future crown princess Catherina-Amalia.\n\n\"Gestampte muisjes\" (\"crushed muisjes\") are muisjes crushed to powder, which are sprinkled onto a slice of bread or a Dutch rusk over butter, a customary breakfast food for Dutch children.\n\n"}

He started an apprenticeship with wine and spirituous liquors producer Matthew Buchan at the age of 13. By 1863, he already owned his own business producing liqueurs and whisky blends. In 1880, his son William Mark joined the business and persuaded his father to bottle various blends of whisky.\n\nThe iconic Vat 69 bottle with its bulbous neck was introduced to the market and was not changed for the next hundred years. In 1882, William Sanderson prepared one hundred casks of blended whisky and hired a panel of experts to taste them. The batch from the cask (or “vat”) with number 69 was judged to be the best, and this provided the whisky's brand name. The whisky was at first bottled in port bottles. In 1884, Sanderson bought the Glen Garioch distillery which was situated in the middle of a barley field. The distillery was meant to ensure the delivery of grain whisky.\n\nSanderson took care that there were always new products to be blended, because DCL, which was a strong society at that time, controlled such a large amount of the production that it had a huge influence on the supply of the competing company. For this reason Sanderson, together with Usher and Bell, founded a company to produce grain whisky, which still exists today as the North British Distillery. Sanderson sourced a few malt whiskies used to blend VAT 69 from a friend, John Begg, who owned the Royal Lochnagar distillery. When Begg died, Sanderson became director of Begg's distillery. In 1933, Sanderson's company merged with Booth's Distilleries, which merged again with the DCL-Group in 1935.\n\nIn autumn 1980, \"Vat 69 Reserve\" from the House of Sanderson had its world première in England.\n\nDespite its name, it is not a vatted malt, but a blend of about 40 malt and grain whiskies. Vat 69 Reserve carries no standard age statement because of the combination of the malts and grains.\n\nSince autumn 1980, Glenesk, which is a 12-year-old Highland Single Malt (40%), is available from Sanderson in Germany. Glenesk is stored for at least 12 years in sherry barrels. Since 1964, William Sanderson & Sons Ltd. has produced \"Antiquary\", which is a 12-year-old De-Luxe-Scotch-Whisky (40%).\n\nWhisky products available from Sanderson in Germany are:\n\nWhisky products available from Sanderson in Australia are:\n\nCaptain Lewis Nixon was an American World War II army officer who is a major figure in the 1992 non-fiction book \"Band of Brothers\" by Stephen E. Ambrose, and the award-winning 2001 HBO miniseries made from it.

Several parts of the Netherlands have their own local recipe, of which the most famous is \"Oudewijvenkoek\" (old woman's cake) which is mostly eaten in the northern regions, and is flavored with aniseed. Ontbijtkoek is traditionally served at breakfast with a thick layer of butter on top, as a replacement for bread. However, due to its sweet taste it is also served as a snack.\n\nOriginally called 'peperkoek' it was made from breadcrumbs and other left over bakery products stored in an attic. These ingredients were periodically collected and pressed to create the 'peperkoek' which was augmented with black pepper to conceal the age of the resulting thick bread, hence its name.

The cocktail is named for its appearance when served, with gradations of color resembling a sunrise.\n\nThe original Tequila Sunrise contained tequila, edi de cassis, lime juice and soda water and was served at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, where it was created by Gene Sulit in the 1930s or 1940s.\nThe more popular modern version of the cocktail contains tequila, orange juice, and grenadine and was created by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in the early 1970s while working as young bartenders at the Trident in Sausalito, California north of San Francisco. In 1972, at a private party at the Trident organized by Bill Graham to kick off the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour in America, Mick Jagger had one of the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking them. They later ordered them all across America, even dubbing the tour itself their \"cocaine and tequila sunrise tour\".\n\nAt the time, the Trident was the largest outlet for tequila in the United States, and in 1973 Jose Cuervo picked up on the new drink as a marketing opportunity and put the recipe for the new drink on the back of their bottles of tequila, and promoted it in other ways. Later that same year the Eagles recorded a song called \"Tequila Sunrise\" for their \"Desperado\" album as the drink was soaring in popularity.\n\nThe Tequila Sunrise is considered a long drink and is usually served in a collins or highball glass. The International Bartender Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail.\n\nThe drink is mixed by pouring in Tequila, ice, then the juice and, lastly, syrup. The signature look of the drink depends on adding the syrup without mixing with the other ingredients. A spoon may be used to guide the syrup down the glass wall to the bottom of the glass with minimal mixing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2739262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2739262", "title": "Mofongo", "text": "Mofongo\n\nMofongo () is a Puerto Rican dish with fried plantains as its main ingredient. Plantains are picked green and fried, then mashed with salt, garlic, and oil in a wooden pilón (mortar and pestle). The goal is to produce a tight ball of mashed plantains that will absorb the attending condiments and have either pork cracklings (Chicharrón) or bits of bacon inside. Most dressings and mixtures include broth, garlic, and olive oil. It is traditionally served with fried meat and chicken broth soup. Particular flavors result from variations that include vegetables, chicken, shrimp, beef, or octopus packed inside or around the plantain orb. \nMofongo's roots lead to the western African Fufu, mixed with Spanish and Taíno influences. Fufu is made from various starchy vegetables and was introduced to the Caribbean by Africans in the Spanish New World colonies such as Cuba \"(fufu de plátano)\", Dominican Republic \"(mangú)\", and Puerto Rico \"(mofongo)\" this also most likely includes Colombia \"(cayeye)\", Amazon region and Peru \"(tacacho)\". Fufu consists of starchy root vegetables and plantains boiled then mashed until a dough-like consistency with water, butter, or milk.\n\nClara Gonzalez, also known as Aunt Clara, is a Dominican chef and author. In her cookbook (Tradition Dominican cookery) claims that mofongo has a special place in the Dominicans' hearts and stomachs but can be traced back to Puerto Rico. Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York, has been interviewed for many magazine on Dominican food and culture, she also says \"mofongo is a dish borrowed from Puerto Rico that has much success with Dominicans\". Mofongo first appeared in a cookbook called \"El Cocinero Puertorriqueño\" – Puerto Rico's first cookbook in 1849. Mofongo in Puerto Rico is available everywhere, not only on tables but built into the culture and identity. It's in their art, pop culture, music, television, books and has a strong history on the island.\n\nMofongo evolved from fufu using African method with Spanish and Taíno ingredients. Plantains are most often used, but other starchy roots native to the island used by Taínos can also be used. Puerto Ricans have an obsession with fried food known collectively as cuchifrito in New York City and Kiosks in Puerto Rico. The usage of Spanish ingredients such as pork, garlic, broth, and olive oil together is heavily used in Puerto Rican cuisine. Staple dishes such as arroz con gandules, alcapurria, pasteles, habichuelas, recaíto, arroz junto and many other dishes all include garlic, pork, olive oil, and broth. The method of frying comes from the African side and is heavily used more than anyplace in the Caribbean. Broth is often made with chicken and sofrito. Sofrito is made with Spanish and Taíno fruits, vegetables, and herbs.\n\nPlantains and/or starchy roots are cut about half an inch thick and deep fried. When done, the plantains/roots are crisp outside, but dense inside. The plantains/roots are then mashed in a wooden mortar and pestle called a \"pilón\" made with mahogany or guaiacum, both native hardwoods. Broth, olive oil, garlic, and pork cracklings are added and mashed as well. The consistency of mofongo is much more stiff than fufu. In Africa, fufu is accompanied by a bowl of soup. In Puerto Rico, traditionally mofongo is accompanied by chicken broth soup, but braised meat has become more popular.\n\nIt is also common in Puerto Rico to make mofongo with cassava (\"mofongo de yuca\"), taro and eddoe (\"mofongo de malanga y yautía\"), bread fruit (\"mofongo de pana\"), or a combination of cassava, ripe and green plantains (\"trifongo\"), ripe and unripe plantains (\"mofongo de amarillo\").\n\nThanksgiving is an American holiday that has been adopted by Puerto Rico. Turkey is the main focus on every thanksgiving table and is traditional stuffed with bread. The traditional bread stuffing is replaced with \"mofongo de batata\" (plantain and sweet potato mofongo) in Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans homes outside the commonwealth. Turkey stuffed with Mofongo can be prepared with seasonings that are traditionally used for pork (marinated in garlic, black pepper, dried oregano, parsley, vinegar and annatto seeds), in which case it can be called \"Pavochon.\"\n\nFrito-Lay produces \"MoFongo Snax\", a combined plantain chips, cassava chips and pork rinds into one bag.\n\n\"Mofongo relleno\" is a stuffed variation of mofongo, which, according to Yvonne Ortiz, was first made in \"Tino's Restaurant on the west coast of Puerto Rico\" when seafood, abundant in the region, was placed inside the plantain ball with braised meat or more seafood poured over it. Nowadays, \"mofongo relleno\" is commonly stuffed with either seafood, poultry, or another meat.\n\nIn Cuba, Mofongo is called \"Machuquillo\" \"por la acción de machucar el plátano en el mortero\" (because of the task of mashing the plantains in the mortar). The plantains are not fried but boiled. Machuquillo is often garnished with parsley and served with roasted pork or chicken.\n\nDuring the 1960s many Dominicans who feared the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo fled to Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo caught on quickly with Dominicans living in Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo has become a flagship food for many Dominican restaurant adding their own flavors such as \"queso frito\" (fried cheese) to mofongo, mashed with no broth and sometimes olive oil is replaced with butter. The plantains in making traditional mofongo are not always fried; they are sometimes boiled, shaped into a ball and stuffed with meat. During the 1960s mofongo started to appear in Dominican cookbooks. Mofongo stuffed with shrimp (camaron in Spanish) is called \"camarofongo\".\n\nMofongo is popular in New Jersey, Chicago, Florida, and anywhere large numbers of Puerto Ricans or Dominicans reside.\n\nFood Network chef and host Guy Fieri featured mofongo from Benny's Seafood (in Miami, Florida) and from El Bohio (in San Antonio, Texas) on two separate episodes of his show \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\". He liked the dish so much that he called it the \"best fried thing I ever ate\" on an episode of the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\".\n\nAnne Burrell is featured in a Season 2 episode of \"Chef Wanted\" with mofongo as the opening dish challenge.\n\nMofongo is also featured in Episode 7, Season 6 of the Food Network show, Beat Bobby Flay, where Bobby Flay's mofongo dish prevails over a mofongo dish prepared by Puerto Rican chef Giovanna Huyke.\n\nAn episode of the Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food Nation\", set in Harlem, showed the host, Adam Richman, visiting a Spanish Harlem restaurant called \"La Fonda Boricua\", where they make a giant 12-plantain mofongo called the \"Mofongaso\".\n\nPerhaps the oldest song mentioning mofongo is called \"Puertorriqueño\" by Joe Valle and César Concepción.\n\nSinger Ismael Rivera with conductor Rafael Cortijo sang a plena song called \"Mofongo Pelao\" about mofongo.\n\nKenan Thompson often mentions mofongo in character as David Ortiz on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nIn \"Sanford and Son\", Fred and Lamont's Puerto Rican neighbor Julio makes and refers to mofongo in season 2's episode \"The Puerto Ricans Are Coming\". It is referred to again in season 3's episode \"Fuentes, Fuentes, Sanford & Chico\" \n\n\"\" featured mofongo in Season 2, Episode 2: Puerto Rico where Tony and his friend Andy dine on mofongo at the beach. \"That is just a tower of goodness,\" said Tony.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n"}

It is a smallish round thick wooden (usually lignum vitae) disc with one or more holes through it, perpendicular to the plane of the disc. Single and triple-hole deadeyes are most commonly seen. The three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep's skull.\nSingle deadeyes (or bull's eyes) are used to guide and control a line and, particularly in older vessels, to change its direction. More modern systems would use a block for this purpose but in traditional rigs with many lines to deal with, designed when blocks were relatively expensive to make, a deadeye provided an acceptable compromise. When blocks came into common use for adjusting running rigging, deadeyes continued to be used for tensioning standing rigging.\nTriple deadeyes are used in pairs; a line called a lanyard is run back and forth between them, through the holes, so that they function again much as a block and tackle would. This provides a mechanical advantage, pulling harder on whatever the deadeyes are attached to. Pairs of deadeyes are placed in the shrouds (the lines that hold up the mast), where they are used to create greater tension in the shrouds. To set up the lanyards used with dead-eyes, a suitable grease such as tallow is first applied to the holes. After reeving the lanyard through the deadeyes, the end is hooked to a handy purchase in the rig above, such as the throat halyard. By hauling on the halyard the lanyard in the deadeyes is drawn up taut. A small wooden wedge is knocked into the last hole, to prevent the lanyard sliding back, and the end is unhooked from the purchase and made up on the shroud above the upper deadeye. The wedge can then be removed ready for the next shroud. As an alternative the tackle on the lanyard can be made fast to the shroud well above the upper deadeye so that it compresses the deadeyes. The last part of the lanyard can then be seized to an adjacent part between the deadeyes. When this is finished the tackle is cast off and the lanyard made off. \n\nIn recent decades, as steel wire became the prevalent material for sailboat rigging, deadeyes and lanyards gave way to metal turnbuckles for tensioning the wires. More recently, however, with the advent of high-strength and low-stretch synthetic fibres, some sailboats are using synthetic rope for standing rigging, and deadeyes and lanyards are coming back into use as tensioning devices.\n\n"}

Traditional dishes such as kroppkakor, pitepalt, potato cake, kåldolmar, mustamakkara and black pudding are also commonly combined with lingonberries. The jam can be paired even with mashed potatoes and the traditional oatmeal porridge, sometimes together with cinnamon, and, perhaps, a little sugar.\n\nFine lingonberry jam is prepared with berries, sugar and, optionally, a small amount of water. Cheaper varieties can be diluted with apples. \"Rårörda lingon\" or \"rørte tyttebær\" is prepared fresh by just mixing berries and sugar, without boiling. Before the use of refined sugar became common in Sweden, lingonberry jam was prepared with lingonberries as the only ingredient. Because of the benzoic acid, which is found in high amounts in lingonberries, the berries keep well without any preservatives.\n\n"}

Some products contain powdered sugar hidden in the wrapper, allowing the user to blow into the cigarette and produce a cloud of sugar that imitates smoke, which comes out of the other end. \n\nCandy cigarettes' place on the market has long been controversial because many critics believe the candy desensitizes children, leading them to become smokers later in life. Because of this, the selling of candy cigarettes has been banned in several countries even though they are continued to be manufactured and consumed in many parts of the world. However, many manufacturers now describe their products as \"candy sticks\", \"bubble gum\", or simply \"candy\".\n\nIn America it was reported erroneously in 2010 that the Family Smoking and Prevention Control Act bans candy cigarettes. However, the rule bans any form of added flavoring in tobacco cigarettes other than menthol. It does not regulate the candy industry. Popeye Cigarettes marketed using the Popeye character were sold for a while and had red tips (to look like a lit cigarette) before being renamed candy sticks and being manufactured without the red tip.\n\n\n"}

The finished LP was a departure from the \"heavy\" sound prevalent on Humble Pie's first album. Humble Pie's effort blended these elements into a tasteful, and very listenable, record. The disc, a definite improvement over their first LP, \"As Safe As Yesterday Is\", bolstered the group's reputation, despite their record company's woes, and disappointing sales.\nImmediate Records rushed the album into UK record shops in the Fall of 1969, hoping the record would enter the charts before the company went bankrupt. However, with no promotional budget to promote it, the album quickly sank without a trace. The LP wasn't released in the US, at that time, although the band was on its first American tour when the album was released, but it got a lot of attention on underground FM stations.\n\nAll four members of the band contributed songs. On the recordings, Peter Frampton contributed acoustic, Spanish, and lead guitars, Steve Marriott played guitar, sitar, percussion and keyboards, and took a turn on bass. Greg Ridley also contributed guitar and tambourine, while Jerry Shirley handled not only his drum kit, but added a percussion saw on the first cut, and as well as tambourine, tablas, and maracas, and Wurlitzer piano on his own composition.\n\nTwo of the more memorable tracks were a cover of the classic Buddy Holly song \"Heartbeat\" and the notable Marriott composition \"Every Mother's Son\". Most, if not all, of the material dated back to recordings in the spring and early summer of 1969, when the band recorded more than two albums' worth of material. Legal wrangling with Frampton's old management had delayed a release until August; the band hit the road for the last half of the year, to practice their chops live, and generate interest with the record-buying public.\n\nLike the band's early live shows, which opened with an acoustic set, before returning to rock out with electric guitars, in the second half of the show, \"Town and Country\" displayed an eclectic mix of acoustic ballads, country-rock, folk and blues, with a couple of hard rock songs to balance it out. After this album, Humble Pie returned to what would become their trademark \"heavy\" sound. Following Frampton's departure, in 1971, the band would continue in the \"boogie rock\" vein, until the remaining and replacement members disbanded in 1975. Although Marriott revived the band in the 80's, Humble Pie never again enjoyed wide popularity. With Steve Marriott's death, in 1991, at age 44, the story came to an end. Humble Pie fans would have to rely on the few albums the band recorded.\n\nThe album was produced by Andy Johns younger brother of famed producer, Glyn Johns, who also worked at the Olympic Studios where the record was made.\n\n\nList incomplete: No vocalist (Marriott) and keyboardist (probably Marriott) for (10) Silver Tongue; there is also no mention of who is playing the organ on track 11 (in addition to Wurlitzer)\n"}

Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word \"midori\" only came into use in the Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) midori was still considered a shade of \"ao\". Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after World War II, during the Occupation: thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word \"ao\" is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples and vegetation. \"Ao\" is also the name for the color of a traffic light, \"green\" in English. However, most other objects—a green car, a green sweater, and so forth—will generally be called \"midori\". Japanese people also sometimes use the English loanword for colors. The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of green and blue.\n\nThe color \"ao\" can also indicate youth, as in the song \"\"Aoi kajitsu\"\" (a song about a young girl) by singer Momoe Yamaguchi, a meaning that stems from the on'yomi (Chinese-based reading) \"sei\" of the kanji for \"ao\".

A bannock is usually cut into sections before serving.\n\nThe word \"bannock\" comes from Northern and Scots English dialects. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states the term stems from \"panicium\", a Latin word for \"baked dough\", or from \"panis\", meaning bread. It was first referred to as \"bannuc\" in early glosses to the 8th century author Aldhelm (d. 709), and its first cited definition in 1562. Its historic use was primarily in Ireland, Scotland and Northern England. The Scottish poet Robert Burns mentions bannock in his \"Epistle to James Tennant of Glenconner\", in reference to Alexander Tennant.\n\nThe original bannocks were heavy, flat cakes of unleavened barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (or \"girdle\" in Scots). In Scotland, before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stane (Scots for stone), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, used as a cooking surface. Most modern bannocks are made with baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent, giving them a light and airy texture.\nThere is a suggestion that bannock cakes played a pivotal role in the deciding of a person for human sacrifice during the late Iron Age in the discovery of Lindow Man.\n\nBannock varieties can be named or differentiated according to various characteristics: the flour or meal from which they are made, whether they are leavened or not, whether they have certain special ingredients, how they are baked or cooked, and the names of rituals or festivals in which they are used. Historically, specially made bannocks were used in rituals marking the changing of the Gaelic seasons: St Bride's bannock for spring (February 1), Bealtaine bannock for summer (May 1), Lughnasadh or Lammas bannock for autumn harvests (August 1), and Samhain bannock for winter (end of October). Other special bannocks include beremeal bannock, bride's bannock, cod liver bannock, cryin' bannock, fallaid bannock, fife bannock, Hogmanay bannock, Marymas bannock, mashlum bannock, Michaelmas bannock, pease bannock, Pitcaithly bannock, salt bannock, sautie bannock, Silverweed bannock, St Columba's bannock, teethin' bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock. Manx \"bonnag\" probably comes from the same root form as bannock and is made using similar ingredients. In the north of England, bannocks are often made using pastry rather than a bread dough.\n\nSelkirk bannock from Scotland is well-known and named after the town in the Scottish borders where it is traditionally made. It is a spongy, buttery variety, sometimes compared to a fruitcake, made from wheat flour and containing a very large quantity of raisins. The first known maker of this variety was a baker named Robbie Douglas, who opened his shop in Selkirk in 1859. When Queen Victoria visited Sir Walter Scott's granddaughter at Abbotsford she is reputed to have taken her tea with a slice of Selkirk bannock, thus ensuring that its reputation was enshrined forever. Today, Selkirk bannocks are popular throughout Great Britain, and can be found at most large supermarkets.\n\nBannock, skaan (or scone), or Indian bread, is found throughout North American Native cuisine, including that of the Inuit of Canada and Alaska, other Alaska Natives, the First Nations of the rest of Canada, the Native Americans in the United States, and the Métis.\n\nA type of bannock, using available resources, such as flour made from maize, roots, tree sap and leavening agents, may have been produced by indigenous North Americans prior to contact with outsiders, similar to modern cornbread. Some sources indicate that bannock was unknown in North America until the 1860s when it was created by the Navajo who were incarcerated at Fort Sumner, while others indicate that it came from a Scottish source.\n\nEvidence for the pre-contact history of bannock comes from the fact that most indigenous North American languages have a distinct word for bannock, such as rather than a borrowing or calque of the English or French words.\n\nOther languages do offer hints of European influence, however, for example \"bread that bubbles\" (i.e. in fat), where \"bááh\" is a borrowing from for flour and yeast bread, as opposed to the older which refers to maize bread cooked in hot ashes Likewise, Yup'ik \"alatiq\" comes from \"pancakes, fritters\".\n\nAs made by Indigenous North Americans, bannock is generally prepared with white or whole wheat flour, baking powder, sugar, lard and water or milk, which are combined and kneaded (possibly with spices, dried fruits or other flavouring agents added) then fried in rendered fat, vegetable oil, or shortening, baked in an oven or cooked on a stick.\n\nBannock is the most universal of dishes in the indigenous Canadian repertoire, and is used equally in the Arctic, Plains, Sub-arctic, and Pacific cultural areas. However, the modern recipes for bannock are clearly influenced by the government rations that were distributed on Indian reserves in the late 19th century when access to country foods (plants and animals native to the region) were restricted by the arrival of non-indigenous settlers. Such rations included the staples of the European Canadian diet at that time: wheat flour, sugar, lard, and butter; all high-calorie, low-nutrient, shelf-stable foods produced in bulk quantities and shipped long distances (together with the preservative and flavour additive, salt). These new ingredients helped indigenous people to survive the loss of access to country foods, and are now thought of by some as fully a part of indigenous identity, and even as \"Indian soul food\". However, for others they are a reminder of the negative impacts of colonialism, and are regarded as an imposition.\n\nBalep korkun is a Tibetan bannock made from barley flour and cooked on a frying pan.\n\n\n\n"}

The first recorded recipe for \"mujaddara\" appears in \"Kitab al-Tabikh\", a cookbook compiled in 1226 by al-Baghdadi in Iraq. Containing rice, lentils, and meat, it was served this way during celebrations. Without meat, it was a medieval Arab dish commonly consumed by the poor, reputed to be a derivative of the \"mess of pottage\" Jacob used to buy Esau's birthright. Because of its importance in the diet, a saying in the Eastern Arab world is, \"A hungry man would be willing to sell his soul for a dish of mujaddara.\"\n\nCooked lentils are popular all over the Middle East and form the basis of many dishes. \"Mujaddara\" is a popular dish throughout the Arab world, and is generally made using brown or green lentils and rice, that can be seasoned with cumin, coriander, or mint. It is topped with fried onions and is generally served with yogurt, among other vegetables and side dishes, either hot or cold.\n\nThe dish is made with brown lentils and rice. In Lebanon, the word \"mjaddara\" refers to the puréed version of the dish, rather than the version with whole grains and lentils. \"Mjaddara\" usually has the consistency of rice pudding whereas in the Lebanese variant known as \"mudardara\", the rice and lentils remain relatively intact and distinct. Both \"mujaddara\" and \"mudardara\" are topped with caramelized onions and usually served with yogurt.\n\nParticularly in Palestine, rice is often replaced with bulgur; the dish is called M'jaddaret-Burghul to distinguish it from the M'jaddara which is served with rice. Pronounced as \"m'jaddara\", the dish is served multiple times a month for family, cooked with olive oil and onion strips, and served alongside local plain sheep's-milk yogurt (laban n'aj) made in Nablus, with green salad.\n\nArab Christians traditionally eat \"mujaddara\" during Lent. The dish is also popular among Jewish communities of Middle Eastern origin, in particular those of Syrian and Egyptian backgrounds; it is generally made with rice rather than wheat. It is sometimes nicknamed \"Esau's favourite\". Jews traditionally ate it twice a week: hot on Thursday evening, and cold on Sunday.\n\nIn Egyptian cuisine, lentils, rice, macaroni, and tomato sauce cooked together are known as kushari. In Indian cuisines, lentils cooked together with rice are known as khichdi (see also kedgeree). In Iranian cuisine, a similar dish composed of rice and lentils is called Addas Polo.\n\nIn Cypriot cuisine, the dish called \"fakes moutzentra\" is very similar to mujaddara, as it consists of lentils and rice.

Sometimes Toor dal is used in Gujarat. It is commonly used in the state of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as well. In Andhra Pradesh and other places, Moong dal, Chana or a mix is used. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are: Nuts, Dates, Turmeric powder.\n\nTo understand the nutritional value we need to look at the main contents of Puran Poli.

It provides Fiber, is a major source of Protein, may help reduce Cholesterol and also contains Zinc, Folate and Calcium.. Toor dal can be used in place of chana dal and it has similar properties as of Chana dal.\n\n2. \"Plain flour\", \"Jaggery\" or \"Sugar\":\nThese are the major sources of Carbohydrates. While plain flour adds Complex carbohydrates, Jaggery and Sugar are Simple carbohydrates.\n\nThe method of preparation varies from place to place. There are many varieties of Obbattu including: peanut, sugar, coconut, sesame and groundnut flavors. Sometimes grated coconut is added in Konkan, Maharashtra. Coconut palm jaggery may be used. Similarly a mix or sugar and jaggery can be used as a sweetening agent. Normally nutmeg is used as a flavoring along the coast which is replaced by cardamom or sometimes both elsewhere. Methods of rolling the stuffed dough also differ. It can be rolled using rice flour which makes the rolling very convenient. In some recipes flour is not used at all; oil or ghee is used to roll it into a flatbread instead. The rolled bread can be roasted with or without any ghee or oil, which sometimes is smeared after its completely cooked. In some places all-purpose flour dough is used after adding a pinch of turmeric which gives it a traditional yellow color. The dish is produced using a sweet filling inside a flour dough. This is then rolled out and cooked on a hot griddle, usually with ghee.\n\nThe size and thickness of puran puri also varies greatly, in Gujarat where the stuffing used is toor dal, it will be small in size and thickness will be more, where as in holige with coconut stuffing it will be larger in size and with less thickness.\n\nIt is also the special dish of Maharashtra which is prepared in every occasion at every house especially during festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi and Holi. It is eaten with Basundi, Aamras, Kadhi, Amti, etc. In Pune, Puran Poli is eaten with a variant of Amti (flavoured sour water) known as \"Katachi Amti\" is prepared with remaining water of Chana Dal used to make Puran. A topping of ghee is must, because Chana dal is heavy to digest and ghee eases to digest. In Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, it is eaten with Wada - A pakora made of all lentils.

It is made with pecans and chocolate chips. The pie was created in the Melrose Inn of Prospect, Kentucky, United States, by George Kern with the help of his parents. It is often associated with the Kentucky Derby.\n\nDerby pie was created in 1950 by the Melrose Inn in Prospect, Kentucky as a specialty pastry. The restaurant's owners and derby pie creators were Walter and Leaudra Kern, who constantly researched the optimal recipe for their creation. They were assisted by their son George Kern. The name \"derby pie\" was chosen because the various family members each had a different name for the creation, so to resolve the naming quandary they put the various names in a hat, and pulled out the paper which said \"derby pie\".\n\nThe name \"derby pie\" is a registered trademark of Kern's Kitchen, which registered the name in 1968. The company uses the name in the form \"DERBY-PIE\" in official literature and advertisements. The recipe is kept secret, known only to a small group of Kern family members and a single Kern's Kitchen employee (who actually mixes the recipe today). Kern's Kitchen diligently guards the trademark and has filed more than 25 lawsuits to protect it over the years. The makers of similar pies have had to use a different name such as \"Pegasus pie\", a reference to the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby Festival, and May Day pie, in reference to the First Saturday in May, the day of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAfter leaving the Melrose Inn in 1960, the Kern family continued to make derby pie for select customers. In 1969 they trademarked the name \"derby pie\" to both the state government of Kentucky and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Since then, the trademark has constantly been renewed as a federally registered trademark. Alan Rupp, a grandson to Walter and Leaudra Kern, took over the derby pie business in 1973, he religiously defended the trademark. Part of this defense including going after various cookbooks that named a similar pie derby pie. A federal judge in April 1982 ruled against a local cookbook, and demanded that the cookbook be recalled so the page with the derby pie recipe could be removed. The cooking magazine \"Bon Appetit\" won a temporary victory in May 1987 when a judge ruled the name \"derby pie\" generic, but the Sixth Circuit United States Court of Appeals reversed the decision, saying the \"Bon Appetit\" magazine \"failed to introduce scientific survey evidence to support their assertion that the public views 'derby pie' as generic\". Federal district courts have continued to side with Kern's Kitchen in this regard. Kern's attorney, Don Cox, estimated in 2008 that the company had sued to protect its trademark 25 times.\n\nIn May 2013, the Electronic Frontier Foundation inducted Kern's Kitchen into its \"Takedown Hall of Shame,\" claiming that \"the company behind the most litigious confection in America is going after individual websites that post new recipes for derby pies.\"\n\n\n"}

Sometimes these desserts were lined with cake or biscuits. Ice cream cake recipes dating to the 1870s have also been found.\n\nIce cream cakes are popular in the U.S. Carvel has a history of themed cakes advertised on television including Fudgie the Whale and Cookie Puss. Baskin-Robbins, Dairy Queen, Friendly's, Cold Stone Creamery, and other retailers also sell ice cream cakes. \n\nIt is common for ice cream cake to be used as a birthday cake during birthday celebrations. At times, when ice cream cake is not available (especially when dining out), fried ice cream (a common dessert found at Asian restaurants (Chinese, Japanese and Polynesian restaurants) can be used as an alternative to the cake variety.\n\nAlong with ice cream, Chocolate Crunchies, sometimes abbreviated Crunchies, are frequently used to make up a layer of ice cream cake. The layer of Chocolate Crunchies is generally sandwiched in between two layers of ice cream. Carvel, Friendly's, and Baskin Robbins all use a layer of Chocolate Crunchies in their ice cream cakes.\n\n\n"}

This cut is usually grilled or broiled; a thicker version is sold as a \"7-bone roast\" or \"chuck roast\" and is usually cooked with liquid as a pot roast.\n\nThe bone-in chuck steak or roast is one of the more economical cuts of beef. In the United Kingdom, this part is commonly referred to as \"braising steak\". It is particularly popular for use as ground beef, due to its richness of flavor and balance of meat and fat.\n\nOther boneless chuck cuts include the chuck eye (boneless cuts from the center of the roll, sold as mock tender steak or chuck tender steak), chuck fillet (sold as chuck eye steak and chuck tender steak,) cross-rib roast (sold as cross-rib pot roast, English roast, or \"the bread and butter cut\"), top blade steak or chicken steak, under blade steak, shoulder steak and shoulder roast, and arm steak and arm roast.\n\nThe average meat market cuts thick and thin chuck steaks (often sold as chuck steak or chuck steak family pack) from the neck and shoulder, but some markets also cut it from the center of the cross-rib portion. Short ribs are cut from the lip of the roll.\n\nSome meat markets will sell cross-rib pot roast under the generic name \"pot roast.\" The difference between a pot roast and a cross-rib pot roast is the vertical line of fat separating the two types of chuck meat; the cross-rib pot roast contains the line of fat. This is what creates richness of flavor in the roast.\n\nThe chuck contains a lot of connective tissue, including collagen, which partially melts during cooking. Meat from the chuck is usually used for stewing, slow cooking, braising, or pot roasting. The top blade part of the chuck is preferred for grilling because it is the second most tender steak once the gristle is removed. The fifth rib taken from the chuck can also be used as an alternative to the prime rib roast, which is usually from bones 6-12. They are similar in terms of the proportion of meat and bone, although the fifth rib exceeds the prime rib in the amount of lean meat. The cross cut or cross rib, which is the last part of the chuck located between the brisket point and the short rib - can also be used as an alternative to the blade when cooking steaks. The chuck part cut from the shoulder clod is also used in place of sirloin since it has a very beefy taste.\n\nIn the United States, chuck has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 113.\n\n\n"}

The name \"deely bobber\" is a genericized trademark; other names include deely-boppers, bonce boppers, or space boppers. In June 1982, a \"New York Times\" headline called them Martian antennae.\n\nStephen Askin invented the original deely bobber in 1981, inspired by the \"Killer Bees\" costumes on \"Saturday Night Live\". Askin was a serial entrepreneur who had sold dartboards depicting Ayatollah Khomeini during the Iran hostage crisis of 1980. Askin made prototype Deely Bobbers in his kitchen and test-marketed them at the Los Angeles Street Fair of summer 1981, selling 800 at US$5 each. He sold the invention to the Ace Novelty Co. of Bellevue, Washington, which launched it in January 1982 at the California Gift Fair. The name \"Deely Bobber\" was suggested by the wife of John Minkove, an Ace marketer; it had been her schoolfriend's placeholder name for \"thingamajig\". It was previously a brand of toy block sold 1969–1973. Deely boppers began retailing in April 1982 at US$3. They quickly became a fad in the United States, before reaching the United Kingdom in July. At the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, 10,000 a day were sold; total sales by August were estimated at 2 million, with Askin getting 5% of the wholesale price. Imitations costing $1–2 undercut the original, though Askin applied for a patent. The original decorations for the antennae were polystyrene shapes covered in sparkles: spheres, stars, hearts.

{"id": "2799330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2799330", "title": "Repentance in Islam", "text": "Repentance in Islam\n\nTawba ( alternatively spelled: \"tevbe\" or \"tawbah\", ) is the Islamic concept of repenting to God due to performing any sins and misdeeds. It is a direct matter between a person and God, so there is no intercession. There is no original sin in Islam. It is the act of leaving what God has prohibited and returning to what he has commanded. The word denotes the act of being repentant for one's misdeeds, atoning for those misdeeds, and having a strong determination to forsake those misdeeds (remorse, resolution, and repentance). If someone sins against another person, restitution is required.\n\nThe literal meaning of the Arabic word \"tawba\" is \"to return\" and is repeated in the Qur'an and \"hadith\" (sayings of Prophet Muhammad). In the context of Islam, it means to turn or to retreat from past sinful and evil activities, and to firmly resolve abstaining from them in future. In , the word \"tawba\" has been associated with the word نصوح (\"nasūh\") which means \"to make pure or sincere\". Thus, \"tawba\" signifies sincere and faithful repentance, free from pretense and hypocrisy.\n\nIn the Quran, there is a complete \"surah\" (chapter) titled At-Tawba, which means \"The Repentance\". As with other topics, the act of atoning (for one's misdeeds) and seeking God's forgiveness has also been discussed in the Qur’an, and given much importance. For those believers who have wronged themselves, the Qur'an asks them to become repentant, seek Allah's forgiveness, and make a sincere tawba. It assures them that if they do this, God will forgive them, and exonerate them from their misdeeds:\n\nThe Qur'an also addresses the disbelievers and urges them to turn to God, upon which God promises to pardon them:\n\nLike Quran, the \"hadith\" also mentions and stresses the importance of \"tawba\": \n\n\n\n\n\nSince the issue of \"tawba\" or repentance arises from Islamic religious context, it can be understood well when discussed from that perspective.\n\nIslam does not view any human being as being infallible. Any human being can be subject to errors, Allah being the only perfect one. Thus the sole authority for the forgiveness of any human being corresponds to Allah. Muslims deny the authority of men to listen to another person's confessions and then pronounce him forgiven of his sin. Likewise repenting to anyone besides Allah is forbidden. The Quran states:\n\nSincere \"tawba\" is always accepted by Allah. Allah says:\n\nIn numerous verses of the Quran, Allah describes Himself as being extremely generous, merciful, and forgiving towards His creations. In verse 22 of sura Al-Hashr, for example, He assures: \"He is Allah besides Whom there is no God; the Knower of the unseen and the seen; He is the Beneficent, the Merciful\".\n\nThe use of the verse \"In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Merciful\" at the beginning of every sura (except one) further testifies to this fact. According to the Quran and Hadith, Allah's overarching mercy permits even the gravest sins to be pardoned by Him, provided the wrongdoer intends a sincere \"tawba\". \n\n\"Shirk\" is an unforgivable sin if one dies without repenting from it: \nAs such, becoming hopeless of the mercy of Allah is prohibited. The Quran declares: \n\nAgain, God says to the believers in a \"Hadith Qudsi\":\"O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me, and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth, and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it.\"\n\nAccording to Islamic Sharia, when an act of \"tawba\" is performed by a Muslim, Allah generally accepts it. However, that tawba should be sincere and true. Islamic scholars agree upon the fact that if a person is not ashamed of his past misdeeds, or does not intend to forsake those, then his verbal announcement of \"tawba\" is an open mockery of repentance. Mere verbal repentance does not account for a true \"tawba\". A sincere \"tawba\" has some criteria. \n\nAli was asked as to what is \"tawba\", and he replied that \"tawba\" consists of six elements: \n\n\nIn Islamic sharia, \"tawba\" is a twofold approach: a person first should be able to recognize and forsake his/her sins upon which Allah promises to forgive them. Islam expects Muslims to realize their mistakes and shortcomings, and to seek His forgiveness. Forgiveness for one's sins is not something that comes automatically; it is something that must be sought for, with sincereness and true devotion. Becoming indifferent to one's sins is seen as dangerous. The Prophet Muhammad said:\n\nAnother important perspective on repentance in Islam is that a person should always seek God's forgiveness even when they are not apparently guilty of any particular sin. This is because there are many subtle natures of sin involving immorality which escape notice, and also because it is a Muslim's duty to turn towards God.\n\n\nTurning away from repentance or postponement of \"tawbah\", was attached with some ill-effects including the follows: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2800790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2800790", "title": "Shabda", "text": "Shabda\n\nShabda, or , is the Sanskrit word for \"speech sound\". In Sanskrit grammar, the term refers to an utterance in the sense of linguistic performance.\n\nIn classical Indian philosophy of language, the grammarian Katyayana stated that \"shabda\" (\"speech\") is eternal (\"nitya\"), as is \"artha\" \"meaning\", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to Patanjali, the permanent aspect of \"shabda\" is (\"meaning\"), while \"dhvani\" (\"sound, acoustics\") is ephemeral to \"shabda\".\n\nOm, or Aum, a sacred syllable of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the crown chakra and white light.\n\nBhartrihari, on the other hand, held a \"shabda-advaita\" position, identifying \"shabda\" as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to Brahman. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as \"shabda\". One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by logicians. His concept of \"shabda-brahman\" which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of \"logos\".\n\nLanguage philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the \"naturalists\" to the Mimamsa school, notably defended by Kumarila, who held that \"shabda\" designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by Mandana Mishra, which identifies \"sphota\" and \"shabda\" as a mystical \"indivisible word-whole\".\n\n\"Shabda\" is a Sanskrit word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: \"shruti\" that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.\n\nIn Sikhism the term \"Shabad\" has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the Holy Text that appears in Guru Granth Sahib, the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of \"ragas\", with each chapter containing many \"shabads\" of that \"raga\". The first \"Shabad\" in Guru Granth Sahib is the Mool Mantar. The script used for the \"Shabad\" is Gurmukhi. \"Shabad\" is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like Deh Siva Var Mohe. The second use of the term \"Shabad\" in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, Waheguru.\n\nEsoterically, \"Shabd\" is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.” Variously referred to as the \"Audible Life Stream\", \"Inner Sound\", \"Sound Current\" or \"Word\" in English, the \"Shabd\" is the esoteric essence of God which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of Sant Mat, Surat Shabd Yoga, Eckankar, Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar), and Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.\n\nAdherents believe that a \"satguru\", Eck Master, or VARDAN Master, who is a human being, has merged with the \"Shabd\" in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the \"Satguru\" attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in Sant Mat the \"raison d’être\" for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one's own divinity is ultimately realized.\n\n\"Naam\" (\"Word\") has been described through the use of several different terms. Sant Baljit Singh, a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term \"Light and Sound Current\". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.\n\n\n"}

Muthiah writes:The Chettiars have traditionally been vegetarians. Their feasts at lifestyle ritual functions remain vegetarian. But trade once had them criss-crossing the southern reaches of peninsular India and absorbing non-vegetarian influences from the Malabar Coast, where Christians of the Orthodoxy of West Asia and Muslims lived in large numbers and Hindus too tended to non-vegetarianism. Further non-vegetarian influences became entrenched in Chettiar food habits from the late 18th Century after they established businesses in Ceylon, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indo-China and what is now Malaysia and Singapore. So did non-vegetarian fare from other parts of India through which they traveled en route to their overseas businesses.Writer Guy Trebay adds in the foreword of the same book:One is lucky to eat like a Chettiar, they say in South India. Chettiars say it themselves. They say it because a Chettiar table is a groaning board but also because the cuisine is uncommonly subtle and aromatic, a heritage of Chettiar participation in the centuries-old spice trade, the global import and export of pungent seeds and fruits and barks from places like Cochin and Penang, the Banda Islands, Arab ports in the Straits of Hormuz. To the coconut and rice and legumes that are staples of South Indian cooking they added Tellicherry pepper, Ceylon cardamom, Indonesian nutmeg, Madagascar cloves and blue ginger, or galangal, from Laos and Vietnam.In places like Penang, in what is now Malaysia, the Chettiars developed a liking for the sweet-sour piquancy of Straits Chinese cooking, In Saigon, they adapted their cuisine to absorb the herbs that perfume Vietnamese food. In Buddhist Ceylon, they relaxed their dietary prohibitions typical of orthodox Hindus and came to enjoy meat.Thus, the Chettinad region—a semi-arid zone comprising scores of villages, sleepy and agrarian, studded with important ancient temples yet far from major commercial centers—became an unlikely locus of internationalized tastes. \n\n"}

Preparations may vary, but it typically consists of aromatic ingredients cut into small pieces and sauteed or braised in cooking oil.\n\nIn Spanish cuisine, sofrito consists of garlic, onion, peppers, and tomatoes cooked in olive oil. This is known as , or sometimes as in Portuguese-speaking nations, where only onions and olive oil are often essential, garlic and bay laurel leaves being the other most common ingredients.\n\nIn Catalan cuisine, olive oil is heavily emphasized as the third critical component in a \"sofregit\" base along with tomatoes and onions. Garlic is optional, as it is not considered an integral part of the standard \"sofregit\" recipe. Some \"sofregit\" recipes do not contain tomatoes at all, but are made more complex with the addition of diced vegetables such as leeks or bell peppers. \n\nIn Italian cuisine, chopped onions, carrots and celery is battuto, and then, slowly cooked in olive oil, becomes \"soffritto\". It is used as the base for most pasta sauces, such as arrabbiata sauce, but occasionally it can be used as the base of other dishes, such as sauteed vegetables. For this reason, it is a fundamental component in Italian cuisine. It may also contain garlic, shallot, or leek.\n\nIn Greek cuisine, the term sofrito refers to a specific dish native to, and almost exclusively to be found on, the island of Corfu. Sofrito is a veal steak slow-cooked in a white wine, garlic, and herb sauce, and is usually served with rice.\n\nIn the Sephardi Jewish cuisine of the eastern Mediterranean and the Maghreb, the term \"sofrito\" emphasizes a method of cooking rather than a specific combination of aromatics. \"Sofrito\" is meat (lamb, beef, chicken) sautéed with garlic, turmeric, and cardamom and simmered in a small volume of water or stock with lemon juice, or simmered with all these ingredients without prior sautéing. The second method can also be used in cooking veal, calves' brains, or fish.\n\nIn Brazilian cuisine, the verb encompasses also dishes that are fried in vegetable oil before being boiled or steamed, even when the actual fried seasoning is not there. Similarly, rice that has been toasted in vegetable oil before it is boiled is technically . Actually, the Portuguese verb literally means \"to fire i.e. heat repeatedly\".\n\nIn Colombian cuisine, sofrito is called \"hogao\" which is made with only long green onion and tomato, or \"guiso\" is made mostly of tomato, onion, coriander, cumin and sometimes garlic; it is used when cooking stews, meats, rice, as a dip or spread for arepas or other street foods and other dishes.\n\nIn Cuban cuisine, sofrito is prepared in a similar fashion, but the main components are Spanish onions, garlic, and green bell peppers. It is a base for beans, stews, rices, and other dishes, including \"ropa vieja\" and \"picadillo\". Other secondary components include tomato sauce, dry white wine, cumin, bay leaf, and cilantro. \"Chorizo\" (kind of spicy, cured sausage), \"tocino\" (salt pork) and ham are added for specific recipes, such as beans.\n\nIn Dominican cuisine, sofrito is also called \"sazón\", and is a liquid mixture containing vinegar, water, and sometimes tomato juice. A sofrito or \"sazón\" is used for rice, stews, beans, and other dishes. A typical Dominican sofrito is made up of very finely chopped green, red, and yellow bell peppers, red onions, garlic, ground oregano, apple cider vinegar, tomato paste, water, and cilantro. Ingredients vary and can change, for instance cubanelle peppers can substitute for bell peppers, celery can replace onions, and parsley or culantro can be used in place of cilantro.\n\nIn Ecuadorian cuisine, sofrito is called \"refrito\", and it is made of Spanish onions, cubanelle peppers, fresh tomatoes, roasted garlic, cilantro, and ground toasted cumin.\n\nIn the Mexican state of Yucatán, habanero chiles are essential to the local variation of sofrito.\n\nIn Puerto Rican cuisine, sofrito is mostly used when cooking rice dishes, sauces, and soups. Sofrito is closely related to \"recaíto\". The two main ingredients that give Puerto Rican sofrito its characteristic flavor are \"recao\" (culantro) and \"ají dulce\", but red and green cubanelle peppers, red bell peppers, pimientos, yellow onions, garlic, plum tomatoes, and cilantro are also added. All red peppers are roasted, seeded, and then added to the sofrito. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with olive oil or annatto oil, \"tocino\" (bacon), salted pork and cured ham. A mix of stuffed olives and capers called \"alcaparrado\" is usually added with spices such as bay leaf, \"sazón\" and \"adobo\".\n\nIn some Caribbean cuisine, sofrito is seasoned lard and functions as a base for many traditional dishes, but prepared differently from the method described above. Lard (acquired from rendering pork fat) is strained, and annatto seeds are added to colour it yellow, and later strained out. To the colored lard is added a ground mixture of cured ham, bell pepper, chile pepper, and onion; after this, mashed coriander leaves (cilantro) and oregano leaves are added. Garlic cloves are added in a tea ball, and the sauce is simmered for half an hour. The term also refers to a number of related sauces and seasonings in the Caribbean and Central and Latin America. \n\nIn Filipino cuisine, \"ginisá\" is a culinary term which refers to a base of garlic, onions, and tomatoes sautéed together with cooking oil. It is essentially similar to the Spanish sofrito.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2812881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2812881", "title": "Ainu cuisine", "text": "Ainu cuisine\n\nAinu cuisine is the cuisine of the ethnic Ainu in Japan. The cuisine differs markedly from that of the majority Yamato people of Japan. Raw meat like sashimi, for example, is rarely served in Ainu cuisine, which instead uses methods such as boiling, roasting and curing to prepare meat. Also unlike Japanese cuisine, traditional Ainu cuisine did not use miso, soy sauce, or sugar, though these seasonings make an appearance in modern Ainu cuisine. The island of Hokkaidō in northern Japan is where most Ainu live today; however, they once inhabited most of the Kuril islands, the southern half of Sakhalin island, and parts of northern Honshū Island.\n\nThere are very few Ainu restaurants in the world, though some do exist such as Ashiri Kotan Nakanoshima in Sapporo, and Poron'no and Marukibune in Ainu Kotan, Hokkaidō.\n\nTraditional Ainu cuisine uses meats obtained through fishing and hunting such as salmon and deer, wild plants gathered in the mountains such as \"cardiocrinum cordatum\" bulbs (\"turep\") and acorns, as well as various grains and potatoes obtained through farming. Other features include its liberal use of oils as flavoring. Due to the Ainu's reliance on local game and fauna, not all areas used all the same ingredients, instead utilizing what was most available.\n\nIn addition to salt, the fats (\"sum\") from cod, sardines, herring, shark, seal, whale (\"humpesum),\" sika deer (\"yuksum\"), and bear (\"pasum\") are used to flavor dishes. Miso and soy sauce have also been used in modern times. Soup stocks may be made using kelp (\"kombu\"), animal bone, and dried fish. Seasoning and spices include \"pukusa\" (\"allium ochotense\"), berries from the Amur corktree (\"phellodendron amurense\"), and wavy bittercress (\"cardamine flexuosa\").\n\nThe most predominate game animal was the sika deer. Deer were hunted using poisoned arrows as well by herding them off cliffs and gathering them from where they fell. In the past, deer were so common and easily hunted in Hokkaidō that it was said one could “put the pot on the fire, then go hunting”.\n\nThe Ainu fished at sea in dugout canoes using harpoons to hunt a variety of large marine animals and used nets and fishing rods to bring in smaller creatures. Beached whales were particularly prized, as generally it was impossible to bring a whale in using canoes and harpoons. However, there were some instances of whaling in Funka Bay using harpoons coated with wolfsbane poison, aided by the gentle tides. The Ainu also used a number of tools including fishing rods, nets, traps (\"uray\"), and fishing baskets (\"raomap\") to catch freshwater fish.\n\nWhile men were responsible for hunting and fishing, women were responsible for gathering edible plants, which they began in early spring. Tools used during gathering trips into the mountains included the \"saranip\" (a bag woven from the fibers of the Japanese lime tree), the \"menoko makiri\" (a small women's knife), \"itani\" (a type of digging stick), and the \"shitap\" (a small pick made from deer horn). One of the most important mountain plants gathered in spring was the Siberian onion (\"pukusa\"), which is very similar to wild leeks found in Canada and the United States in taste, texture and appearance. Large quantities of \"cardiocrinum cordatum\" bulbs (\"turep\") were gathered in summer as they were important as a preserved food.\n\nSpring\n\nSummer\n\nFall\nFarming was already taking place in Hokkaidō during the Jōmon period, prior to the Satsumon period in which the Ainu first appeared. However, agriculture began to decline in the 12th century up until the Ainu period. Rather than being caused by the cold climate, it is thought to be caused by the increase in demand for dried fish and furs for trade with Honshū, leading to increased importance in hunting and fishing. Cultivated crops changed over the years as new crops were introduced, such as potatoes, kabocha, and beans.\n\n\"Citatap\" translated from Ainu means “that which has been pounded”. As the name would suggest, \"citatep\" is meat or fish that has been pounded in a way similar to the Japanese method tataki.\n\nMaking \"Citatap\"\n\n\nOther than salmon, a variety of meats and fish are used to add flavor to \"citatap\" such as Japanese dace, \"bathyraja lindbergi\", masu salmon, Japanese fluvial sculpin, deer, bear, tanuki, rabbit, and chipmunk. It was good to make \"citatap\" from the meat of older animals, as it made the tough meat easier to eat.\n\"Citatap\" was primarily made in the winter, when food spoiled more slowly, and was eaten over a number of days. If the \"citatap\" was not particularly fresh, it was formed into balls and added to soup.\n\nSoup made from boiling fish or meats with various vegetables. \"Ohaw\" may be soup, or more like a Japanese \"nabemono\" (hot pot) that contains a high ratio of ingredients to broth. As a hunter-gatherer society, the Ainu did not have a staple food as such, but \"ohaw\" was a central dish in their food culture. It is thought to be the roots of Hokkaidō regional dishes such as Ishikari nabe and sanpei soup. There are no specific requirements for which ingredients to use for \"ohaw\", but was generally made as described below.\n\nDifferent varieties of \"ohaw\" are named by their main ingredient such as \"cep ohaw\" (fish soup), \"kamuy ohaw\" (bear soup), \"kam ohaw\" (meat soup), and \"kina ohaw\" (vegetable soup). \"Anemone flaccida\" was particularly suited for use in soups and was therefore called \"ohaw kina\", which literally translates as “soup grass”.\n\nTranslated literally, \"rataskep\" means “mixed food”. Wild vegetables and beans are stewed until soft and the liquid has evaporated, at which point the mixture is mashed and seasoned with bear or fish oils and a small amount of salt. Rataskep was made as an everyday food, as well as for offerings at ceremonies, as it was considered a sacred food. There are unlimited varieties using different ingredients, below are a few examples.\n\nSikerpe kina Rataskep\n\nPukusa Rataskep\n\nCihue Rataskep\n\nKabocha Rataskep\n\nCipor Rataskep\n\nNisew Rataskep\n\nA thin porridge made from boiling Japanese millet or rice. Generally, the grains are boiled alone, but occasionally gathered vegetables are added. Unlike other porridges in agricultural societies, \"sayo\" is not a staple food. Rather, Ainu would fill up on fatty soups and grilled meats then drink it like tea as a palate cleanser. For that reason, \"sayo\" was made in a small dedicated pot so as to avoid mixing oils in from other dishes. Care was also taken to avoid mixing flavors when serving by using a separate ladle specifically for serving \"sayo\" (\"sayo kasup\"), rather than the usual ladle for serving soup (\"kasup\"). As the porridge uses very little grains to make, a month's supply for one person was approximately 1.8 liters. 108 liters would provide plenty for a family of five for a year.\n\nThe following are examples of sayo varieties.\n\nTurep Sayo\n\nIrup Sayo\n\nEnto Sayo\n\nSatsirari Sayo\n\nKikinni Sayo\n\nCipor Sayo\n\nA type of dumplings. The name \"sito\" is derived from the Japanese \"shitogi\" which refers to dumplings or a paste made from grinding raw grains. Traditionally, \"sito\" were considered a luxury due to the time and effort necessary to produce the flour by grinding the grains with mortar and pestle. It was therefore not a usual everyday food, but one made as offerings for sacred days such as the Bear Festival (\"iomante\") and Ancestors’ Festival (\"icarup\").\n\nUsual ingredients were proso millet (\"mankul\"), foxtail millet (\"munchiro\"), and rice (\"siamam\"), though \"sito\" made with proso millet were considered the correct form. Over the years, other ingredients were added such as pumpkin (\"kabocha\"), and potato (\"imo\"). Similar to the Japanese \"kusamochi\", the Ainu also made \"sito\" which mixed in Japanese mugwort (\"noya\"). Their flavor was enjoyed as reminiscent of spring.\n\nMaking Sito\n\n\n\"Sito\" that were meant to be offerings were placed as is in ceremonial lacquerware boxes (\"sintoko\"), wooden bowls (\"patci\"), on small trays (\"otcike\"), or skewered with \"cornus controversa\" sticks and presented to the gods. When meant to be eaten by people, the \"sito\" were served with partially crushed salmon roe or a sauce made from mixing oils with dried and crushed kelp.\n\n\"Sito\" has a long history. Dumplings made from foxtail millet have been found in archeological Satsumon remains discovered in Atsuma. Traditional Ainu cuisine did not use steamed rice to make dumplings, as the Japanese did with mochi. The Ainu first came in contact with Japanese style mochi after the Edo period when more ethnic Japanese moved to live in the same areas as the Ainu under the land contract system.\n\n“Meal” in Ainu is “\"ipe\"”. Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (\"kunneywa ipe\") and dinner (\"onuman ipe\"), and a third meal, lunch (\"tokes ipe\"), was added during the Taisho period. A night meal (\"kunne ipe\") was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (\"kasup\") into a lacquerware bowl (\"itanki\") for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds. Items such as fish roasted on a spit or \"sito\" were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (\"pasuy\") or spoons (\"parapasuy\"). \"Parapasuy\" translated literally means “wide chopstick”. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say “\"ipeyan\"” (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say “\"hunna\"” to express their gratitude for the food.\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, “\"itanki kem atsukep\"”, literally meaning “bowl licking finger”.\n\n\n"}

After refinements by the chef, Charles Ranhofer, the creation was added to the restaurant’s menu as \"Lobster à la Wenberg\" and it soon became very popular.\n\nAn argument between Wenberg and Charles Delmonico caused the dish to be removed from the menu. To satisfy patrons’ continued requests for it, the name was rendered in anagram \"Lobster à la Newberg\" or \"Lobster Newberg\". It is still quite popular and is found in French cookbooks, where it is sometimes referred to as “Homard sauté à la crème.” When Ranhofer’s printed recipe first appeared in 1894, the lobsters were boiled fully twenty-five minutes, then fried in clarified butter, then simmered in cream while it reduced by half, then brought again to the boil after the addition of Madeira.\n\nLobster Newberg is related to Lobster Thermidor, a similar dish that involves lobster meat cooked with eggs, cognac, and sherry that appeared in the 1890s.\n\n\n"}

Daughters of a monarch are actually referred to by other terms, e.g. , literally king's daughter, even though \"Hime\" can be used to address \"Ōjo\".\n\nThe word \"Hime\" initially referred to any beautiful female. The antonym of \"Hime\" is \"Shikome\" (醜女), literally \"ugly female\", though it is archaic and rarely used. \"Hime\" may also indicate \"feminine\" or simply \"small\" when used together with other words, such as \"Hime-gaki\" (a low line of hedge).\n\n\"Hime\" is commonly seen as part of a Japanese female divinity's name, such as Toyotama-hime. The Kanji applied to transliterate \"Hime\" are 比売 or 毘売 rather than 姫. The masculine counterpart of \"Hime\" is \"Hiko\" (彦, 比古 or 毘古,) which is seen as part of Japanese male gods' names, such as Saruta-hiko. Unlike \"Hime\", \"Hiko\" is neutral, non-archaic and still commonly used as a modern Japanese male given name, for example Nobuhiko Takada.\n\nUsually, a \"Hime\" will go through a ceremony, in which she is considered a \"Daoshi\" and then later becomes a Hime. The ceremony is similar to the Japanese tea ceremony, and is usually up to 3 hours.\n\nThe saying \"Ichi hime ni taro\" (\"First baby, a girl. Second baby, a boy\") originally meant that having a girl first and a boy second was easier on the mother as she gained experience before nurturing a boy. However, with each household having fewer children, this is commonly confused as having \"one girl and two boys\", or three children. This is because \"ichi\" means \"one\" in Japanese and \"ni\" means \"two\" in Japanese, and therefore could be read as, \"One girl, two boys.\"\n\nWhile many use the name \"Hime\" to address those of a higher or more noble birth, there are a few who use it as a girl's name. Thus some names either incorporate the word \"Hime\" or the giver simply will name said girl \"Hime\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2827095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2827095", "title": "Manti (food)", "text": "Manti (food)\n\nManti (, , , ), also manty (; ; Tatar: манты), mantu (Pashto, Persian, ; ), or manta (, \"manta\", \"monta\"), is a type of dumpling popular in most Turkic cuisines, as well as in the cuisines of the South Caucasus, Central Asia more broadly, Afghanistan, and Chinese Muslims. Nowadays, manti are also consumed throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries, where the dish spread from the Central Asian republics. The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef in a dough wrapper, and either boiled or steamed. Size and shape vary significantly depending on the geographical location. Manti resemble the Chinese jiaozi, Korean mandu, Mongolian buuz, and the Tibetan momo, and the dish's name is cognate with the Korean mandu, Chinese mantou, and Japanese manjū, although the Chinese and Japanese counterparts refer to different dishes.\n\nThe name, depending on the language, can refer to a single dumpling, or to more than one dumpling at a time; in English, it is often used as both a singular and plural form.\n\nThe origin is somewhat uncertain. While the Chinese word \"mantou\" has been suggested as the origin for the word \"manti\", this word had several different spellings in Chinese in the past indicating that the Chinese attempted to adapt a foreign word to their writing system. Originally, mantou was meat filled. Mantou still retains its old meaning as stuffed bun in Wu Chinese as \"moedeu\". But in Mandarin and many other varieties of Chinese, mantou refers to steamed bun, while baozi resembles the ancient mantou stuffed with meat.\n\nThe dish may have originated in the territories of Mongol Empire. Some variations may be traced back to the Uyghur people of northwest China. One of the earliest mentions of \"manta\" is found in the 1330 manuscript \"Yinshan Zhengyao\" by Hu Sihui, a court therapist in service of the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, Buyantu Khan.\n\nIn general, there is agreement that the recipe was carried across Central Asia along the Silk Road to Anatolia by Turkic and Mongol peoples. According to Holly Chase, \"Turkic and Mongol horsemen on the move are supposed to have carried frozen or dried manti, which could be quickly boiled over a camp-fire\". According to an Armenian researcher, manti first reached Cilician Armenia as a result of the cultural interaction between Armenians and Mongols during their alliance in the 13th century. Migrating Turkic-speaking peoples brought the dumpling with them to Anatolia, where it evolved into the Turkish \"mantı\". When the Tatars settled into the Kayseri region of modern-day Turkey, the area became known for its manti.\n\nKorean mandu is also said to have arrived in Korea through the Mongols in the 14th century. However, some researchers do not discount the possibility that manti may have originated in the Middle East and spread eastward to China and Korea through the Silk Road.\n\nThe earliest written Ottoman mantı recipe appears in a 15th-century cookbook written by Muhammed bin Mahmud Shirvani. The version in Shirvani's book is a steamed dumpling with a minced lamb and chickpeas filling spiced with cinnamon and flavored with vinegar. The dish was garnished with sumac and like most contemporary mantı variations, it was served with a garlic-yoghurt sauce. \n\nMany early Turkish cookbooks do not mention a dish called \"mantı\". The first printed recipe book, \"Melceüt`t Tabâhhin\", was published in 1844. It includes a recipe for a dish called \"tatar boreği\", which is similar to \"mantı\" but is not served with garlic yoghurt sauce. The first English language Ottoman cookbook and a third cookbook printed in 1880 includes this same recipe. Another 1880 cookbook does have a recipe for \"mantı\", but instead of a dumpling, it is a dish composed of layered dough served with mincemeat and garlic yogurt. This book also includes a recipe of \"piruhi\"—a cheese filled version of the \"tatar boreği\" recipe.\n\nManti in Central Asian cuisines are usually larger in size. They are steamed in a multi-level metal steamer called \"mantovarka\", \"mantyshnitsa\" (Russian terms for manti cooker), \"manti-kazan\" or \"manti-kaskan\" (manti pot). It consists of layered pans with holes that are placed over a stock pot filled with water. Steaming is the main method of cooking manti; if boiled or fried, they are considered another type of dumpling, such as pelmeni. \n\nIn Kazakh cuisine, the manti filling is normally ground lamb (sometimes beef or horse meat), spiced with black pepper, sometimes with the addition of chopped pumpkin or squash. This is considered to be a traditional Uyghur recipe. Manti are served topped with butter, sour cream or an onion sauce or garlic sauce. When sold as street food in Kazakhstan, manti are typically presented sprinkled with hot red pepper powder.\n\nIn Uzbek, Tajik and Kyrgyz cuisines, manti are usually made of one (or a combination) of the following ingredients: lamb, beef, cabbage, potato or pumpkin, with fat often added to meat manti. Manti are usually topped with butter and may be served with sour cream, different types of ketchup, or freshly sliced onions (sprinkled with vinegar and black pepper). A sauce made by mixing vinegar and chilli powder is also common. In Uzbekistan, manti are also called \"kaskoni.\"\n\nThe same style of cooking manti is traditional for Tatar, Bashkir and other cuisines of the Turkic peoples living in the vast area from Idel-Ural to the Far East. It is nowadays widespread throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries.\n\nIn Afghan cuisine, the mantu are filled with beef or lamb mixed with minced onions and spices, steamed and then topped with a very typical sauce (\"seer mosst\", lit. ‘garlic yoghurt’) of yoghurt, dried or fresh mint, lemon juice and minced or pressed garlic. The mantu are also typically topped with a very small amount of tomato-based sauce which can include split peas, red kidney beans and/or some sautéed ground meat. The amount of yoghurt sauce is typically much greater than the tomato sauce; the tomato sauce is meant to be dotted on top - not covering the dish. Chutney, a spicy green or red pepper condiment sauce, may be sprinkled on top. Many Afghans also like to serve mantu with a carrot qorma or stew, instead of a tomato-based sauce.\n\nIn contrast to the Central Asian varieties, manti in Anatolia and Transcaucasia are usually boiled or baked rather than steamed and tend to be small in size. A mid-15th-century Ottoman recipe has survived, with the manti filled with pounded lamb and crushed chickpeas, steamed, and served topped with yoghurt mixed with crushed garlic and sprinkled with sumac. In modern Turkish cuisine, manti are typically served topped with yoghurt and garlic, and spiced with red pepper powder and melted butter, and topped with ground sumac and/or dried mint by the consumer.\n\nSimilarly, the Armenian manti, also sometimes referred to as monta, are usually served with yoghurt (\"matzoon\") or sour cream (\"ttvaser\") and garlic, accompanied by clear soup (\"mantapour\"). Manti are more common among western (Cilician) Armenians, while among eastern Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, similar dumplings called khinkali are more prevalent.\n\nA popular type of Turkish manti is known as \"Kayseri mantisi\", originally from Kayseri, an Anatolian city. \"Kayseri mantisi\" is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with Aleppo pepper) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes. It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while \"boş mantı\" (‘empty dumpling’) lack filling entirely.\n\n\"Tatar boreği\" is similar to mantı. In North Cyprus is traditionally served with grated halloumi cheese and mint. \n\nSimilarly small dumplings are also found in other Turkic cuisines but they are not considered to be a type of manti. Examples are \"dushbara\" in Azerbaijani cuisine and \"chuchvara\" in Uzbek cuisine.\n\nIn Bosnian cuisine, the name \"klepe\" is used. These are made of minced meat with onions. It is served in a sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. There is also a separate dish called \"mantije\", which is made of the same ingredients, but the pastry balls are put together with no free space in between and baked. After the baking yogurt is poured on top. This second type is considered to be a pita or börek rather than manti, and is primarily made in the region of Sandžak.\n\n\n"}

While small, they tend to be intensely radioactive.\nThe fuel particles, the size about 10 micrometers, are a strong source of beta and gamma radiation and a weaker source of alpha radiation. The disparity between alpha and beta radiation (alpha activity is typically 100–1000 times weaker than beta, so the particle loses much more negatively charged particles than positively charged ones) leads to buildup of positive electrostatic charge on the particle, causing the particle to \"jump\" from surface to surface and easily become airborne.\n\nFuel fleas are typically rich in uranium 238 and contain an abundance of insoluble fission products. Due to their high beta activity, they can be detected by a Geiger counter. Their gamma output can allow analysis of their isotope composition (and therefore their age and origin) by a gamma-ray spectrometer.\n\nFuel fleas can be very dangerous if they become embedded within a person's body, but are generally not considered more dangerous than an equal amount of radioactive material evenly distributed throughout the body. An exception would be if the flea was embedded in a particularly vulnerable organ such as the cornea of the eye or inhaled into the lungs.\n\nThe most likely cause of fuel fleas is when the cladding surrounding the nuclear fuel becomes ruptured or cracked (known as \"fuel pin failure\"), allowing the fuel particles to escape and allowing the coolant to enter the fuel rod, further accelerating the process. In water-cooled reactors, this can be due to the reaction of the zirconium alloy cladding with the cooling water, which produces hydrogen. The hydrogen can be absorbed into the cladding material, resulting in hydrogen embrittlement. Embrittled cladding is less ductile and more susceptible to cracking. This process is avoided in modern reactors by carefully monitoring the fuel assemblies, limiting operating lifetime of the fuel, and by using alloys developed to resist hydride formation.\n"}

The origin of the dish is claimed by both the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily. Other variations found outside Italy may include chicken, veal, or another type of meat cutlet or vegetable filling.\n\nThe dish consists of sliced eggplant, pan fried in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese, and baked in an oven. In some versions, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and dredged in flour or breadcrumbs before frying. Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmigiano, while others use softer melting cheeses like mozzarella, or a combination of these.\nIn Naples, Parmigiana is also prepared using zucchini or artichokes in place of eggplants.\n\nVariations made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken, have been popularized in other countries, usually in areas of Italian immigration. In such areas the original dish may be called \"eggplant parmigiana\" to distinguish it from the meat versions.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana are often served as a main course often with a side of pasta. Chicken parmigiana is also served as the filling of a submarine sandwich. The alternate anglicization \"Parmesan\" is sometimes used instead, and the abbreviated form \"parm\" is common. The use of meats as an alternate to eggplant originated in the United States, where it was influenced by similar Italian dishes. A similar veal dish is known in Italian as \"Cotolette alla Bolognese\", however traditional Italian recipes exclude tomato sauce from the dish. \"Costolette Parmigiana\" is another similar veal dish, however in Italy it is generally served without sauce or cheese. \n\nChicken parmigiana is also a common dish in Australia and is often served with a side of chips or salad. In Australia, where the name is often shortened to \"parmi\" or \"parma\", it may also contain a variety of toppings, including sliced ham or bacon.\n\nIn Argentina and in other neighboring South American countries, veal or chicken parmigiana is topped with ham and served with french fries. It is known as milanesa a la napolitana. If the dish is topped with a fried egg, then it is known as a \"súper milanesa\" or \"suprema napolitana\".\n\nA similar dish, the parmo, which uses either pork or chicken, has developed in England.\n\nIn Brazil, Parmigiana is a popular restaurant dish, which was brought over by Italian immigrants. There are three kinds of Parmigiana in Brazil: \"filé de frango a parmigiana\" (chicken fillet parmigiana), \"berinjela a parmigiana\" (eggplant parmigiana) and \"bife à parmigiana \" (beef parmigiana), the latter of which may specify a prime cut if used, with \"filé mignon à parmigiana\" (tenderloin parmigiana) and \"contra-filé à parmigiana\" (sirloin steak parmigiana) being common. In Brazil, Parmigiana dishes are usually served with either white rice and french fries or with pasta in a tomato sauce.\n\n"}

Ginger snaps are flavoured with powdered ginger and a variety of other spices, most commonly cinnamon, molasses and nutmeg. There are many recipes. The brittle ginger nut style is a commercial version of the traditional fairings once made for market fairs now represented only by the Cornish fairing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Australia, and New Zealand and most of the former British Empire, they are often called ginger nuts. Ginger nuts are not to be confused with pepper nuts, which are a variety of gingerbread, somewhat smaller in diameter, but thicker. In 2009, McVitie's ginger nuts were listed as the tenth most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea.\n\nGinger nuts are the most popular biscuit in New Zealand, normally attributed to its tough texture which can withstand dunking into liquid. Leading biscuit manufacturer Griffin's estimates 60 million of them are produced each year. This has become the title of a book, \"60 Million Gingernuts\", a chronicle of New Zealand records. In Australia, Arnott's Biscuits manufactures four different regional varieties of ginger nut to suit the tastes of people in different states.\n\nIn the United States, the usual term is ginger snaps, and they are generally round drop cookies, usually between 3 mm (1/8-inch) and 6 mm (1/4-inch) thick, with prominent cracks in the top surface.\n\nScandinavian ginger nuts, also called ginger bread or \"brunkage\" in Danish (literally meaning \"brown biscuits\"), \"pepparkakor\" in Swedish, \"piparkakut\" in Finnish, \"piparkūkas\" in Latvian, \"piparkoogid\" in Estonian and \"pepperkaker\" in Norwegian (literally, pepper cookies), are rolled quite thin (often under 3 mm (1/8-inch) thick), and cut into shapes; they are smooth and are usually much thinner and hence crisper (and in some cases, more strongly flavoured) than most global varieties. Cloves, cinnamon and cardamom are important ingredients of these, and the actual ginger taste is not prominent. Allspice was used formerly to season ginger biscuits, but cloves replaced it later.\n"}

The true origin of green tea ice cream, however, is unknown. Although green tea itself seems to have existed as local handmade ice cream at some districts in Japan, none of the Japanese flavored ice creams were really merchandised until the 1990s because the major Japanese ice cream manufacturers were producing vanilla, strawberry and chocolate as their primary flavors. However, green tea shaved ice has been well known and popular in Japan long before green tea ice cream.\n\nThe amount of luxurious imported ice cream has increased in the Japanese market since the import liberalization act of ice cream in 1990. However, the trigger of the nationwide sales of Green Tea Ice Cream in Japan was actually from the importation of green tea ice cream from Maeda-en USA in California with the catch phrase \"Pure Japanese style made from California”. It has been produced since April 1995, using fresh California milk made in U.S.A.\n\nThe same product was soon imported and distributed to convenience stores and supermarkets in Japan as well and it was introduced in some Japanese newspapers. Soon after, the Japanese ice cream manufacturers recognized that Japan was ready to move on to a new era, one where Japanese people accepted different and unique ice cream flavors besides vanilla, strawberry and chocolate.\n\nDuring a certain period of the 1980s in Japan, Meiji Dairies started selling its green tea ice cream with Lady Borden Brand but eventually discontinued selling the product. In 1995, Maedaen exported green tea ice cream to Japan, which became current topic in Japan rapidly, then influenced other major manufactures to start introducing their green tea ice cream products. As a result, many more green tea ice cream products spread into market in Japan until now.\n\nHäagen-Dazs Japan started producing green tea ice cream in 1996. The product is now sold in Japanese grocery markets and has become one of the company's most popular flavors.\n\nStatistics from the Japanese Ice Cream Association show that green tea ice cream was ranked third in the “Favorite Ice Cream Flavor” study. It is served in many restaurants as a dessert.\n\nIn order to prevent a change in color to green tea ice cream (catechin) from sunlight, some containers have lids with an opaque underside. Some green tea ice cream is artificially colored, and others have natural green coloring from the catechin present in green tea.\n\nGreen tea ice cream has been available in the United States, the country with the largest ice cream consumption, since the late 1970s, primarily in Japanese restaurants and markets. It is currently becoming mainstream and can also be made at home.\n\nThe U.S. saw rapid growth in Japanese cuisine and sushi popularity in the mid 1990s, which resulted in a big expansion of the Japanese restaurant business in the U.S. This development gradually helped people learn about green tea, resulting in green tea ice cream becoming a typical dessert.\n\nIn those days, there were two different kinds of green tea ice cream served at restaurants. One was made by mixing dissolved matcha powder into vanilla ice cream in a restaurant’s kitchen, while the other was made by a local ice cream manufacturer who did not know the proper way to make the dessert. In the first method, ice cream had to be melted once and refrozen when they mixed in the dissolved matcha powder, resulting in the ice cream having an undesired texture. The second method had artificial green tea coloring and flavoring because most of those local ice cream manufacturers could not import authentic matcha powder from Japan; therefore they usually replaced it with an artificial flavor that was accompanied with a strong chemical smell that was often covered by the heavy use of sugar.\n\nGreen tea ice cream could easily be integrated into various decorations and arrangements with other ice cream flavors. It could be served with other Japanese sweets such as , , and .\n\n"}

It later came to mean an elected or unelected official of a municipality, or the representative of a borough in the English House of Commons.\n\nThe term was also used in some of the original American colonies. In the Colony of Virginia, a \"burgess\" was a member of the legislative body, which was termed the \"House of Burgesses\".\n\nIt was derived in Middle English and Middle Scots from the Old French word \"burgeis\", simply meaning \"an inhabitant of a town\" (cf. \"burgeis\" or \"burges\" respectively). The Old French word \"burgeis\" is derived from \"bourg\", meaning a market town or medieval village, itself derived from Late Latin \"burgus\", meaning \"fortress\" or \"wall\". In effect, the reference was to the north-west European medieval and renaissance merchant class which tended to set up their storefronts along the outside of the city wall, where traffic through the gates was an advantage and safety in event of an attack was easily accessible. The right to seek shelter within a burg was known as the \"right of burgess\".\n\nThe term was close in meaning to the Germanic term \"burgher\", a formally defined class in medieval German cities (Middle Dutch \"burgher\", Dutch \"burger\" and German \"Bürger\"). It is also linguistically close to the French term \"Bourgeois\", which evolved from \"burgeis\". \n\nThe original version of the well-known English folk song \"Greensleeves\" includes the following:\n\n<poem>Thy purse and eke thy gay guilt knives,\nthy pincase gallant to the eye:\nNo better wore the Burgesse wives,\nand yet thou wouldst not love me.</poem>\n\nThis clearly implies that at the time when it was composed (late 16th to early 17th century) a burgess was proverbial as being able to provide his wife with beautiful and expensive clothes.\n\n"}

A 1928 description of the drink was: \"gin, a spot of lime, and soda\". The description in the 1953 Raymond Chandler novel \"The Long Goodbye\" stated that \"a real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's lime juice and nothing else\". This is in line with the proportions suggested by \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930), which specifies one half Plymouth Gin and one half Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. However, modern tastes are less sweet, and generally provide for at least two parts gin to one part of the lime and other non-alcoholic elements (see recipes below).\n\nThe derivation of the name of the cocktail is contested. It may be named after the tool for drilling small holes (alluding to its 'piercing' effect on the drinker) or after Surgeon Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette KCB (1857–1943), who is said to have first added lime cordial to the daily gin tot of the men of the Royal Navy to help combat the ravages of scurvy on long voyages. A variant of the cocktail, the vodka gimlet, replaces gin with vodka. A similar lime juice cocktail using rum instead of vodka or gin is the daiquiri.\n\nDavid A. Embury gave a gimlet recipe (called a Gin Sour) in \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\" (3rd Ed., 1958), calling for an 8:2:1 gin/lime (or lemon) juice/simple syrup ratio plus garnish. Eric Felten essentially repeated this in his \"How's Your Drink\" column in \"The Wall Street Journal\" Weekend Edition of August 4, 2006:\n\nWilliam L. Hamilton gave this recipe in his \"Shaken and Stirred\" column in \"The New York Times\" on September 15, 2002: A gimlet served at the Fifty Seven Fifty Seven Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel consists of the following, shaken with ice:\n\nThe \"Bartender's Bible\" by Gary Regan lists the recipe as:\nRegan also states \"since the Rose's product has such a long and impressive history (which predates the gimlet), I am inclined to think that Rose's was the ingredient that invented the drink\".\n\nThe \"New New York Bartender's Guide\" by Sally Ann Berk lists the ratio of gin to Rose's lime juice as 3:1.\n\nThe recipe on Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice label:\n\nCharles H. Baker quoted a recipe in \"The Gentleman's Companion - an Exotic Drinking Book\" (1939) of:\n\nTake a big saucer champagne glass, put in 45 ml (1 jigger) either of dry or old Tom gin, 5 ml (1 tsp) gomme syrup or sugar, 2.5 ml ( tsp) – to taste – of lime syrup or lime cordial.\n\nFill up with chilled plain water, add 1 ice cube and thin slice of big green lime. Don't use soda water, please.\n\nHe is also quoted from the book as saying:\n\nThe following vodka gimlet recipe is from the novels of Stuart Woods:\nPour six ounces [180 ml] of vodka from a 750 ml bottle; replace with six ounces [180 ml] Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice (available from nearly any grocery), add a small amount of water for ice crystals, shake twice and store in the freezer overnight. Pour into a martini glass and serve straight up. The glass will immediately frost over. With this recipe, no cocktail shaker is required and the cocktail is not watered down by melting ice. You may use even the cheapest vodka, and no one will ever know.\n\nA variation that adds mint, is commonly known as a South Side\n\nThe Carnaby Gimlet, a variation with natural spring water, was created at the Carnaby Club, Rimini, Italy. The recipe is:\n\nThe word \"gimlet\" used in this sense is first attested in 1928. The most obvious derivation is from the tool for drilling small holes, a word also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing. Thus, the cocktail may have been named for its \"penetrating\" effects on the drinker.\n\nAnother theory is that the drink was named after British Royal Navy Surgeon Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette KCB (1857-1943), who allegedly introduced this drink as a means of inducing his messmates to take lime juice as an anti-scurvy medication. (Limes and other citrus fruit have been used by the Royal Navy for the prevention of scurvy since the mid-18th century.) However, neither his obituary notice in the BMJ, \"The Times\" (6 October 1943) nor his entry in \"Who Was Who 1941–1950\" mention this association.\n\n"}

Transportation does not add value to the product, i.e. is not a transformation for which the consumer is willing to pay.\n\nWhether in the form of raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), or finished goods, represents a capital outlay that cannot yet produce an income. The longer a product sits in one of these states, the more it contributes to waste. The smooth, continuous flow of work through each process ensures excess amounts of inventory are minimized. \n\nIn contrast to transportation, which refers to damage and transaction costs associated with moving the product, motion refers to the damage and costs inflicted on what creates the product. This can include wear and tear for equipment, repetitive strain injuries for workers, or unnecessary downtime.\n\nWhenever the product is not in transportation or being processed, it is waiting (typically in a queue). In traditional processes, a large part of an individual product's life is spent waiting to be worked on. \n\nMaking more of a product than is required results in several forms of waste, typically caused by production in large batches. The customer's needs often change over the time it takes to produce a larger batch. Over-production has been described as the worst kind of waste.\n\nDoing more to a product than is required by the end-customer results in it taking longer and costing more to produce. This also includes using components that are more precise, complex, expensive or higher quality than absolutely required.\n\nHaving to discard or rework a product due to earlier defective work or components results in additional cost and delays.\n\nOrganizations often under-utilize the skills their workers have or permit workers to operate in silos so that knowledge is not shared. This was added to the original seven forms of waste, as resolving this waste is a key enabler to resolving the others.\n\nThe eight forms of waste were developed for Toyota specific processes. Companies have further identified such other forms of waste as:\n\nGeneral uncertainty about the right thing to do, or absence of documented procedures and operating statements.\n\nWriter Jim Womack described \"thinking you can't\" as the worst form of waste, quoting Henry Ford's aphorism:\nShigeo Shingo divides process related activity into Process and Operation. He distinguishes \"Process\", the course of material that is transformed into product, from \"Operation\" which are the actions performed on the material by workers and machines. This distinction is not generally recognized because most people would view the \"Operations\" performed on the raw materials of a product by workers and machines as the \"Process\" by which those raw materials are transformed into the final product. He makes this distinction because value is added to the product by the process but not by most of the operations. He states that whereas many see Process and Operations in parallel he sees them at right angles (orthogonal) (see Value Stream Mapping). This starkly throws most of the operations into the waste category.\n\nMany of the TPS/Lean techniques work in a similar way. By planning to reduce manpower, or reduce change-over times, or reduce campaign lengths, or reduce lot sizes the question of waste comes immediately into focus upon those elements that prevent the plan being implemented. Often it is in the operations' area rather than the process area that muda can be eliminated and remove the blockage to the plan. Tools of many types and methodologies can then be employed on these wastes to reduce or eliminate them.\n\nThe plan is therefore to build a fast, flexible process where the immediate impact is to reduce waste and therefore costs. By ratcheting the process towards this aim with focused muda reduction to achieve each step, the improvements are 'locked in' and become required for the process to function.

The company originally sought to develop a large sugarcane plantation and built the first distillery in Chichigalpa (about 120 km from Managua) at the base of the San Cristóbal Volcano. \n\nCompañía Licorera de Nicaragua was founded in 1937. It was founded by the great-grandfather of the current president, who moved from Italy to Nicaragua in 1875. After building the distillery, it was not until 1937 that Flor de Caña was formally introduced to the Nicaraguan market, with Flor de Caña Etiqueta Amarilla and Flor de Caña Etiqueta Roja being the first two flavors. \n\nIn 1959 it was first exported to Venezuela, Costa Rica and other Central American countries. Between 1963 and 1965 the distillery in Chichigalpa underwent modernization updates. Eight years later a second distillery was constructed in Honduras. During the 1980s, Flor de Caña was stored in large quantities due to the Nicaraguan Revolution. By 1990, Flor de Caña had the largest reserve of aged rum in the world. \n\nThe distillery in Chichigalpa was completely modernized in 1996. The company now sponsors the Flor de Caña Open, an event on the PGA Tour Latinoamérica, in addition to international bar-mixing competitions. It also sponsors international fishing tournaments of the International Game Fish Association. \n\nFlor de Caña rum is distilled five times during its production. Each rum is aged in a charred white oak barrel having previously been used to mature bourbon whiskey, and is also created to comply with kosher standards. The company’s rums are aged for up to 25 years. The contemporary line has five premium rums, two super-premium rums, and three ultra premium rums. In 2013 the company updated its bottle design, that includes examples of the rum’s award wins and a volcano, intended to represent the volcanic soil of Nicaragua. The rums are distributed in forty-three countries. The Flor de Caña brand symbol is present on all bottles. The logo depicts medals won by the rum and the San Cristobal Volcano.\n\nFlor de Caña produces both white and dark rums. In 2018 it became fair trade certified through Fair Trade USA.\nFlor de Caña is renowned as one of the best rums from Latin America, having won more than 150 international awards since 2000 and has been the most award-winning rum brand during this period. It has captured gold, silver, and bronze medals and has received high recommendations from wine and liquor enthusiasts. In 2017 it was recognized at the International Wine and Spirit Competition as the Global Rum Producer of the Year.\n\n"}

It is a local specialty of the Gangwon province of South Korea, and its capital city, Chuncheon.\n\n\"Makguksu\" is closely related to \"naengmyeon\", the archetypal Korean cold noodle dish. However, its differences lie in the high concentration of buckwheat flour in its noodles — the result of the grain being a staple crop in the Gangwon-do area, and the use of greater amounts of vegetables. The dish gets its name \"rough noodles\" because the buckwheat used is generally unhulled.\n\n\"Makguksu\" is usually prepared directly from buckwheat crop, soaked, and ground into a paste. Since buckwheat is less glutinous than most grains, buckwheat flour is particularly difficult to knead, roll, and slice into noodles by hand; thus, the noodles are often created in a hand-cranked noodle-making machine instead.\n\nIt is difficult to generalise regarding \"makguksu\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s accompanying ingredients. Ingredients are traditionally determined by the customer rather than the restaurant owner, and many restaurants also carry their own unique flavouring recipes. In most cases, \"makguksu\" is very spicy, sometimes seasoned with \"gochujang\" (hot chile pepper paste). Various types of kimchi can be added as well: \"nabak kimchi\", \"dongchimi\" or \"baechu kimchi\". Many recipes also add various vegetables and/or soy sauce. \"Banchan\" (side dishes) vary in equal measure. In the Chuncheon area, the dish is frequently accompanied by boiled beef or pork; elsewhere, it may be served with \"bindaetteok\" (mung bean pancakes) or \"gamjajeon\" (potato pancakes).\n\n\"Makguksu\" has become a large part of the identity of the Chuncheon region. In recent decades, a \"buckwheat noodle street\" featuring more than a dozen \"makguksu\" restaurants has developed in the downtown area. There is a makguksu museum, and the city also hosts the annual Chuncheon Makguksu Noodle Festival, featuring \"makguksu\" tastings and other celebrations.\n\n\n"}

In western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio, the slicing process is also referred to as \"Pittsburgh style\".\n\nSometimes the chopped ham, once chipped, is mixed and heated with barbecue sauce before it is made into a sandwich. In the Pittsburgh region, sandwiches of \"ham barbecue\" are commonly served at home and available at lunch counters. The ham can also be fried before being put on a sandwich; this version is often referred to as \"frizzle fry\". The chain Isaly's helped to popularize chipped chopped ham.\n\nChipped chopped ham reached a broad audience in the post-World War II era when it was heavily marketed as a luncheon meat suitable for packed lunches. Former United States Army soldiers likened it to Spam, to which they had grown accustomed while in the army. Its popularity has been furthered by its relatively low cost per pound.\n\nThe product is produced by a few meat packing facilities that process pork products and is marketed under a variety of commercial brand names.\n\n\n"}

Those \"conversos\" who remained and secretly retained their beliefs avoided eating pork, forbidden in Judaism; this put them at risk of being noticed not to hang sausages, traditionally made of pork, in their \"fumeiros\" (smokehouses). As a way to avoid attracting the attention of the Portuguese Inquisition or in rural areas the Portuguese Christians, they began to make sausages from other meats such as poultry and game, mixed with bread for texture. With time, the dish spread to the remaining population and became an example of typical Portuguese cuisine, though nowadays its preparation is no longer strictly guided by Jewish dietary precepts.\n\nAlheiras were traditionally grilled or roasted and served with boiled vegetables. Nowadays they are often fried and served accompanied by french fries and a fried egg. They are often one of the cheapest items on restaurant menus, although those made with game can be expensive.\n\nAlthough \"alheiras\" are typically associated with the city of Mirandela, the regions of Beira Alta and Trás-os-Montes are also famous for their alheiras.\n\nVarieties with PGI protection status include \"Alheira de Vinhais\" and \"Alheira de Barroso-Montalegre\".\n\n\n"}

These were popular in the Italian Renaissance and later. They may be commemorative, but especially in the Renaissance and Mannerist periods were often made for purely decorative purposes, with often crowded scenes from religious, historical or mythological sources. Only one side is decorated, giving the main point of distinction with the artistic medal, where both sides are normally decorated. Most are rectangular or circular, but other shapes are found, as in the example illustrated. Typical sizes range from about two inches up to about seven across a side, or as the diameter, with the smaller end or middle of that range more common. They \"typically fit within the hand\", as Grove puts it. At the smaller end they overlap with medals, and at the larger they begin to be called plaques. \n\nThe form began in the 1440s in Italy, but spread across Europe in the next century, especially to France, Germany and the Low Countries. By about 1550 it had fallen from fashion in Italy, but French plaquettes were entering their best period, and there and in Germany they continued to be popular into the 17th century. The form continued to be made at a low level, with something of a revival from about 1850. They have always been closely related to the medal, and many awards today are in the form of plaquettes, but plaquettes were less restricted in their subject-matter than the medal, and allowed the artist more freedom. \n\nThe purpose and use of decorative plaquettes was evidently varied and remains somewhat unclear; their creation and use is relatively poorly documented. Some were mounted in furniture, boxes or other objects such as lamps, and many examples have holes for hanging on walls, added later. Other copies have three or four holes, for holding in a setting. Religious subjects in a pair or set might be set into the doors of tabernacles, and many were used for paxes, sometimes after being given a frame. Some shapes were designed for particular roles such as decorating sword hilts, though perhaps not all copies made were used in this way. Others were framed for hanging, but many were probably just kept and displayed loose, perhaps propped up on a shelf or desk, or in drawers or boxes. Many images show signs of wear. Devotional images were probably often carried around in a pocket, a habit that became common with crucifixes in Florence after a plague in 1373. A large part of the market was probably other artists and craftsmen looking for models for other forms. Plaquette bindings are leather bookbindings that incorporate plaquette casts in gesso, often of designs that are also found in metal.\nPlaquettes were also collected, and in particular 16th-century examples are often crowded with figures, making the scenes hard to read. They are best appreciated when held in the hand near a good light source, and were probably passed round when a collection was shown to fellow connoisseurs. The difficulty of reading the scenes, and an often obscure choice of subjects, suggest that a self-conscious display of classical learning was part of their appeal, for collectors and artists alike. They were one of the types of objects often found in the – normally male – environment of the studiolo and cabinet of curiosities, along with other small forms such as classical coins and engraved gems. \n\nThe artists who made them tended to be either sculptors in bronze, also making small figures and objects such as inkwells, or goldsmiths, who often practised in the related field of engraving. They were relatively cheap and transportable, and were soon disseminated widely across Europe, offering an opportunity for artists to display their virtuosity and sophistication, and promote themselves beyond their own city. The same factors, combined with their modern display behind glass, make them relatively little appreciated today. The moulds were also sometimes re-used at considerable distances from their time and place of creation, or new moulds were made from a plaquette. German 17th-century plaquettes were still being used as models for silverware in Regency London.\n\nPlaquettes, like prints, played an important part in the diffusion of styles and trends in iconography, especially for classical subjects. Some drawings for plaquette designs survive; others copied prints, book illustrations and designs in other media, including classical engraved gems and sculpture. In Germany models in wood or limestone might be made. They were often made in sets, illustrating a story, or set of figures.\n\nAs with medals, Renaissance plaquettes were normally made using the lost wax technique of casting, and numbers of copies were presumably normally made, although many now only survive in a unique copy, and perhaps never had others. The quality of individual castings can vary considerably, and the time and locations of individual castings from the same mould my vary considerably. Some designs can be shown to have had different generations of casts made from casts. Most are in bronze, but silver and gold, in solid or plated and gilded forms, are also found, as well as other metals. Often plaquettes with copies in precious metal also exist in bronze copies. \n\nIn early 16th-century Nuremberg, which was the main German centre, plaquettes, like other metalwork types of objects, were often made in the relatively plebeian material of brass, even by top artists like the Vischer family and Peter Flötner. Lead was also used, especially in German castings intended as artisan's models rather than for collectors. From the 19th century on cast iron was also used, especially in Germany. In Italy lead was also used for an initial trial cast. The castings were normally not worked much further with tools, beyond polishing and often giving an artificial patina.\n\nThe word plaquette is a 19th-century invention by the French art historian Eugene Piot. \"Les Bronzes de la Renaissance. Les Plaquettes\" by Émile Molinier of 1886 was the first large study, and these two between them defined the form as it is understood today. To Renaissance Italians plaquettes were known, along with other similar types of objects, by a variety of somewhat vague terms such as \"piastra\" and \"medaglietti\", \"rilievi\", or \"modelli\".\n\nPlaquettes grew from two rather different Italian origins. In Rome in the 1440s and 1450s they began as a way of reproducing the designs of classical engraved gems, by taking a wax impression of them. The Venetian Pietro Barbo (1417–1471) became a cardinal when his uncle was elected Pope Eugenius IV in 1431. He became an enthusiastic pioneer of this form, maintaining a foundry in his new Palazzo Venezia, and perhaps participating in the casting himself. These plaquettes had the same small size and classical subject matter as the gems they replicated. \n\nAround the same time north Italian artists began making plaquettes, often much larger and with religious subject matter. Padua, already an important centre of metalworking, is seen by many historians as the crucial location. Two significant works, neither typical of later examples, were the self-portrait head by Leon Battista Alberti, oval and 20 cm high, and a slightly larger circular \"Madonna and Child with putti\" by Donatello (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). This remained highly unusual in that the reverse is concave and repeats the design. Other larger religious reliefs by Donatello were copied or adapted in a smaller plaquette format by other artists, probably including his own workshop. These grew out of a wider context of small religious images that represented mass-produced versions for the middle classes of the larger and unique religious art made for the rich and for churches. Also in the 1440s Pisanello was establishing the genre of the double-sided portrait medal, followed by Matteo de' Pasti and others. By the later decades of the century medals and plaquettes were being produced in most of the north Italian artistic centres. \n\nSignificant later artists included Moderno (as he signed many of his works), who was very likely Galleazzo Mondella, a goldsmith from Verona recorded in Rome around 1500. Some 45 plaquettes are signed by or attributed to him (and hardly any medals), and a number of members of his workshop have been identified by their styles. Andrea Riccio, Giovanni Bernardi, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Valerio Belli, and Leone Leoni, are among the artists to whom a clear name can be attached. Many significant unidentified masters are given notnames by art historians, such as Moderno and Master IO.F.F., who often signed their works. Belli and Bernardi were the leaders in the luxury form of small intaglios engraved in rock crystal, and several of these were reproduced in plaquette form around 1520–40, some cast from wax impressions taken off the crystals. Riccio was also a sculptor of small bronzes, and his plaquettes tended to have a relatively high relief. He had a large workshop and many followers.\n\nGerman production began in Nuremberg, around 1500, but by 1600 Augsburg was the main centre. German examples tended to draw their designs from prints, and were in turn frequently reused in other media, and perhaps more often produced primarily as models for other trades. The repeated reuse of moulds, and their distribution far from their place of making, are especially typical of south German plaquettes. Even fewer of the artists involved are known than in Italy. Production lasted well into the 17th century, when it became involved in the \"Dürer revival\", with several of his prints being turned into plaquettes.\nFurther north plaquettes were produced from around 1550, initially under influence more from Germany than Italy. Artists (often Huguenot in France) included Étienne Delaune, who mostly lived in Strasbourg, and François Briot from Lorraine. François Duquesnoy from Brussels worked as a sculptor in Rome from 1618, and influenced Flemish plaquettes.\n\nThe form saw a small revival in the 19th century; examples from this period are typically rather larger than in the Renaissance. Artists such as, in America, Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Emil Fuchs made commemorative portrait plaquettes of figures such as Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain (both by Saint-Gaudens). Especially in France and Germany, commemorative plaquettes for industry and institutions involved a wide range of contemporary subject matter. A number of artists produced examples purely because they were attracted by the form, or the possibility of reaching a wider market. A number of regular awards by institutions chose the plaquette form, though often retaining \"medal\" in the name of the award. The circular so-called \"death penny\" (the Memorial Plaque) minted in the UK after World War I is a large twentieth-century commemorative example.\n\nMany major museums have collections, which are not always given room in the gallery displays. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., despite being essentially a collection of paintings, has what is recognised as the finest single collection, especially of Italian Renaissance work, which includes over 450 plaquettes, and is very well displayed on the ground floor. \n\nThe Washington collection of medals, plaquettes and small bronzes includes the leading French collection assembled by Gustave Dreyfus (1837–1914), which was bought by Samuel H. Kress (1863–1955). In 1945 the Kress Foundation added over 1,300 bronzes collected by the British art dealer Lord Duveen, and donated all its collection to the museum in 1957. Joseph E. Widener had already given the museum a significant collection in 1942.\n\nThe Wallace Collection in London has a good smaller display, as do the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Cabinet des médailles, Paris, the Hermitage Museum, the Ashmolean in Oxford, and a number of German museums, although the outstanding Berlin collection was lost in World War II. Not much of the British Museum's important collection is on display, nor that of the Vatican Museums. \n\nThe Bargello in Florence has some 400 plaquettes, about half from the collection of the Medici family, who played an important role in the development of the form. Most of the rest are from the collection of Louis Carrand, who bequeathed it to Florence. After that of Drefus, this is the next most important collection assembled in Paris in the 19th century and still intact. Paris was then the centre of plaquette collecting.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While white flour is common, many enthusiasts prefer whole wheat or rye.\n\nThe method of using eggroll wrappers instead of making the dough for the bolani is a time saving convenience often used in Western countries. The edges of the eggroll wrappers are lightly brushed with water to allow for sticking. The wrappers are then filled half way either diagonally or lengthwise with the preferred filling. Each side is then fried until golden brown. This method is the easiest and fastest way of preparing bolani.\n\nAnother popular method for making \" Perakai \" Bolani is baking them. Although, Frying is the most popular method for special occasions, baking is becoming very popular amongst the western crowd. While baking Bolani was originally to cut back on fat, it is now becoming popular due to the unique flavor it imparts. Baking allows for a thicker crust that leads to a fluffy pastry filled with toppings.\nSome argue that baked Bolani is not traditional due to its thick nature and meat stuffed variations.

While it can be eaten all year round, traditionally it is most popular during Chinese New Year. It is considered good luck to eat nian gao during this time, because \"nian gao\" is a homonym for \"higher year.\" The Chinese word 粘 (\"nián\"), meaning \"sticky\", is identical in sound to 年, meaning \"year\", and the word 糕 (\"gāo\"), meaning \"cake\" is identical in sound to 高, meaning \"high or tall\". As such, eating nian gao has the symbolism of raising oneself taller in each coming year (年年高升 \"niánnián gāoshēng\"). It is also known as a rice cake. This sticky sweet snack was believed to be an offering to the Kitchen God, with the aim that his mouth will be stuck with the sticky cake, so that he can't badmouth the human family in front of the Jade Emperor. It is also traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival.\n\nOriginally from China, it spread to or gave rise to related rice cakes in other Asian countries.\n\n\"Nian gao\" sounds identical to 年高 implying promotions or prosperity year after year. This association makes nian gao a popular gift item during the New Year period.\n\nOn the more human level, nian gao are popular as gifts during the Chinese New Year. The traditional nian gao is round with an auspicious decoration such as the character for prosperity (福) on its top. The character is often written in the traditional Chinese script.\n\nAs a gift item, nian gao are fashioned into different shapes with attractive packaging to suit the festive season. Popular designs include a pair of carps (年年有餘) symbolizing surplus every year, ingots (元寶), or the God of Wealth 財神. These designs are auspicious symbols and send good wishes for the New Year.\nSome innovative producers have added a scratch area for consumers to reveal a lucky number for lottery bets.\nThe production, sales and consumption of nian gao is another evidence of food as a transmission medium for social aspirations and how it can be shaped, packaged and promoted in varying forms to resonate with consumer’s social dreams.\n\nDespite numerous varieties, they all share the same glutinous rice ingredient that is pounded or ground into a paste and, depending on the variety, may simply be molded into shape or cooked again to settle the ingredient. nian gao has many varieties including the types found in Shanghai cuisine, Fujian cuisine and Cantonese cuisine originating from Guangdong.\n\nThe Guangdong variety is sweetened, usually with brown sugar. It is distinct with a dark yellow color. The paste is poured into a cake pan and steamed once more to settle mixture. The batter is steamed until it solidifies and served in thick slices. It may be eaten as is. The nian gao becomes stretchy and extremely sticky. It can also be served as a pudding flavored with rosewater or red bean paste.\n\nThe next stage is optional as it can be pan-fried afterwards, often with egg, to make (煎年糕, \"jyutping\": zin1 nin4 gou1). When fried it is slightly crispy on the outside, and remains pasty on the inside. During Chinese New Year, it is cut into square pieces and served along with similar cake dim sum dishes like taro cake and water chestnut cake.\n\nSouthern region of Fujian nian gao, natural amber, mainly for the New Year ritual and gifts. It is made of glutinous rice and taro, usually being sliced and cooked before eating. It can also be wrapped in egg or cornstarch (corn flour) or sweet potato to fry.\n\nNian gao was white along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and it is a mild food. It is made by mixing rice with glutinous rice; the ratio between the two can be adjusted according to personal preferences. If you like to eat softer, you can increase the proportion of glutinous rice and vice versa. Cooking methods include steaming, frying, sliced frying or for soup. Ningbo nian gao is the most famous and common practices include pickled pork soup nian gao and shepherd's purse fried nian gao. Shanghai's ribs nian gao are also distinctive. In addition, there are more uses of the foot to make nian gao in the southern part of the rural system rice cakes, called \"foot cake”. The Shanghai Niangao style is usually packaged in a thick soft rod to be sliced up or packaged pre-sliced and either stir-fried or added to soup. Depending on the cooking method this style is a soft to a chewy variant. The Shanghai style keeps the nian gao white, and made with non-glutinous rice. The color is its distinct feature. When served as a dish, the most common is the stir-fry method, hence the name (炒年糕, \"chǎo nián gāo\"). There are three general types. The first is a savory dish, common ingredients include scallions, beef, pork, cabbage, Chinese cabbage etc. The second is a sweet version using standard white sugar. The last version is taste-less, and is often consumed for its chewy textures.\n\nNorthern nian gao can be steamed or fried, mainly sweet in taste. Beijing nian gao including jujube nian gao (made with jujube and either glutinous rice or yellow rice), mince nian gao and white nian gao. Shanxi has the habit of making nian gao using fried yellow rice and red bean paste or jujube paste for filling. Hebei has the habit of using jujube, small red beans and green beans to steam nian gao. In Shandong, it is made of red dates and yellow rice. The northeast nian gao is made of beans on sticky sorghum.\n\nIt is commonly called \"tikay\" () in Burma, from Hokkien 甜粿.\n\nIn Indonesia, it is known as \"Kue Keranjang\". Kue keranjang was originally named as \"Nien Kao\" or \"Ni-Kwee\" or Yearly Cake or Seasonal Cake, because they are only made once a year. In East Java, this cake was named Kue Keranjang because the wrapper is made from a bamboo basket with a little hole in the middle. In West Java, it was named China Cake, as the origin of the cake from China, but some call it China Cake because the producers are Chinese (known as Tionghoa).\n\nIn Malaysia, it is called \"kuih bakul\" (pinyin: \"jiān nián gāo\") and is often fried in a sandwich in between pieces of taro or sweet potato.\n\nNian gao is also widely consumed in the Philippines (where it is known as 'tikoy', from Hokkien 甜粿), during the Chinese New Year. It is sweetened with brown sugar, giving it a dark yellow to light brown colour, but it is also often prepared with different flavours, like ube (Purple yam), giving it a purple colour, or Pandan, giving it a green colour. \"Tikoy\" were most likely brought by the Fujianese to the Philippines, it may be eaten as is, but can also be dipped in beaten egg and lightly pan fried until crispy but still chewy inside. There is also a version of tikoy in southern Quezon province. Unlike others, this variant of tikoy is sweet and is similar to Japanese Mochi.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, \"seenakku\" () has a Malay origin and derives from Chinese influence. \"Seenakku\" is a popular sweet among the country's Sinhalese and Malay communities and is served with grated coconut. \"Seenakku\" is called \"cheena kueh\" by the Sri Lankan Malay community.\n\nIn Thailand, it's known as \"Khanom Kheng\" ().\n\nBánh tổ is a Vietnamese counterpart to the Chinese \"nian gao\"\n\nDifferent parts of Asia have mixed the cake with different ingredients such as red bean paste or even lotus seed paste.

It is used for the same kind of text which in English would be placed between parentheses or brackets, or in footnotes. The word “warichū” itself is used in some computer programs that deal with \"CJK\" typesetting, and in discussions about CJK typography.\n\nThe \"warichū\" is typeset by setting the annotation using small type that is about half size, cutting it into two equal parts, stacking them on top of each other, and then putting the resulting stacked lines into the space of a normal line of text.\n\nBecause Han characters are typically typeset with equal width and height, the two halves of a warichū annotation should contain exactly the same number of characters if the annotation itself contains an even number of characters. If the annotation contains an odd number of characters, the first half should have exactly one character more than the second half.\n\nIf the annotation is too long, line wrapping may occur. In that case, the warichū itself will behave like two or more tiny pages, wrapping the annotation inside several parts of the line-wrapped warichū.\n\nIn Japanese typography, warichū is still sometimes used, in dictionaries for example. However, it has fallen into disuse in Chinese typography to such an extent that Chinese people will most likely either find it archaic, or will not know what it is when they see it. \nWarichū tend to be used only in vertical writing.\n\nSome of the typesetting programs and word processors support typesetting warichū if support for “Asian” typography is turned on. In Adobe Illustrator, it is called “warichu”; some other programs (for example, OpenOffice.org) avoid the word by calling it “writing in double lines”, describing the visual appearance of warichū.\n\nSome programs claim to support warichū but fail to do it correctly. For example, some programs cannot split the annotation into \"equal\" halves.\n\nAdobe Illustrator allows one to create warichū which consists of more than two lines, though warichū is traditionally always split into only two lines.\n\nWarichu is also a social annotation tool for Internet Explorer and Firefox/Mozilla derivative browsers.\n\nThere is also a macro for typesetting warichū in LaTeX, called Gezhu ().\n"}

Its GI tag number is 85.\n\nDharwad peda was originally started by the Thakur family who had migrated from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh to Dharwad after plague broke out in Unnao in early 19th Century. Ram Ratan Singh Thakur, a first generation confectioner, started producing and selling pedas locally. Dharwad peda was prepared from the milk of Dharwadi buffaloes which are raised by the Gavali community in and around Dharwad. His grandson Babu Singh Thakur helped grow the family business further in their Line Bazaar store and the peda came to also be called locally as the \"Line Bazaar Peda\". The family closely guards the recipe of the Peda as a trade secret which has been passing down the lineage. Babusingh Thakur's single outlet store that was running for a few decades expanded later in Dharwad, Hubli, Bangalore and Haveri. In many other cities around India other confectioneries also sell Dharwad peda which is not connected to the Thakur family.\n\nThe ingredients include milk, sugar and condensed milk.\n\nIt is made of milk which is heated and stirred continuously, with added flavor and sugar. As a result, it can be considered a kind of caramel.\n\n"}

The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig’s bladder was. \n\nUntil 1870, rugby was played with a near spherical ball with an inner-tube made of a pig's bladder. In 1870 Richard Lindon introduced rubber inner-tubes and because of the pliability of rubber the shape gradually changed from a sphere to an egg. In 1892 the RFU endorsed ovalness as the compulsory shape. The gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years.\nThe introduction of synthetic footballs over the traditional leather balls, in both rugby codes, was originally governed by weather conditions. If the playing surface was wet, the synthetic ball was used, as it didn't absorb water and become heavy. Eventually, the leather balls were phased out completely.\n\nThe rugby ball used in rugby union is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile.

It involves a ceremony of initiation into the characters of the syllabary. In Tamil Nadu they call it as Mudhal Ezhathu. In Odisha it is known as Khadi Chuan () and is mainly celebrated on Ganesh Chaturthi and Vasant Panchami.\n\nThe Vijayadashami day is the tenth and final day of the Navratri celebrations, and is considered auspicious for beginning learning in any field.

This is also considered a day when the Goddess of learning, Saraswati, and teachers (gurus) must be revered by giving Gurudakshina.

Writing on the tongue with gold invokes the grace of the Goddess of Learning, by which one attains the wealth of true knowledge. The ritual also involves an invocation to Lord Ganapathy for an auspicious start to the learning process.\n\nNowadays, the Vidyarambham ceremony is celebrated by people across all castes and religions, with small variations in the rituals followed.

It is prepared with fresh beans and it can be found in almost all restaurants in Macedonia and North Macedonia and all over the Macedonian diaspora and Greek diaspora. This meal is baked and served in a traditional clay made pot. Both names are translated as \"Beans on a \"tava\" (Turkish for \"frying pan\"). Tavče gravče is considered the national dish of North Macedonia.\nTavče gravče in the Tetovo style is widely known in North Macedonia. The Verian style is the most famous style in Greece.\n\nThe basic ingredients in Tavče gravče are:\n\n\nThe beans are cleaned and then soaked in cold water preferably overnight but if time is the problem than they can be soaked for several hours or until beans become soft. The water where the beans were soaked need to be disposed and fresh water is used to be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one hour. After first boiling, the water is thrown out, beans are washed and new fresh water is added and they are boiled again. The changing of the water allows the beans to release indigestible sugars that can create gasses in our body. This process also makes the beans more digestible. Then a whole onion is added to the boiling water with beans. When the beans are boiled the boiled onion is fried on a side with a scoop of flour and a teaspoon of ground red paprika and added to the boiled beans. Salt and black pepper are added to the soup; in a less traditional development dried vegetable and taste enhancing mix known as Vegeta is added. Some people also add dried meat like smoked pork, bacon, Suho meso to the mix. When the beans are boiled and when all the ingredients are added they are put in earthenware or also called \"clay made pot\" covered with a lid and it is cooked in an oven at 220 °C. During the baking, the beans are cooked carefully so that they do not become dry.\n\nThe earthenware does not just give a traditional look to the meal, but also keeps the beans warm and gives a special flavor to this dish.\n\nWhite beans that are used to make Tavče Gravče or kidney beans are part of the legume family. Legume plants or so called dry edible beans such as pinto, navy, kidney, pink and black beans, lentils, peas, chickpeas, peanuts and soybeans are all nutrient-rich foods that contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients while providing moderate amount of calories. Beans provide protein, fiber, iron, potassium and magnesium and they contain little or no total fat, trans-fat, sodium and cholesterol. That is why promoting beans in a diet could improve overall health and also decrease the risk of developing certain diseases, including heart disease, obesity and many types of cancers. \n\nIn the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming 1.5 cups of beans per week to take advantage of these potential health benefits.\n\nSerbia\n\nIn Serbia Tavče Gravče is called Prebranac is one of the staple dishes of Serbian and Bosnian cuisine. It is one of the classic comfort foods of Balkans – a casserole of caramelized onions and white beans, in a sauce flavored with bay leaves and sweet Hungarian paprika. Originally made by farmers during long winters – it's nutritious, wholesome and by far one of the cheapest dishes ever made. \n\nGreece \n\nFasoulotavas () is a famous dish served in Greece restaurants as well. This is vegetarian dish and the main ingredient is butter or elephant beans known as gigantes. Gigantes can be found all over Greece but the best beans are supposed to be from the northwestern region of Kastoria. \n\nFrance\n\nThe French version of Tavče Gravče is called \"cassoulet\". There are innumerable versions of cassoulet but most are based on a stew of white beans and various forms of pork. The dish gets its name from the pot it's traditionally baked in which is called the \"\"cassole\"\" which is often shaped like a wide inverted cone to insure the greatest amount of luscious crust. \n\nUnited States\n\nThe dish is called Bean Stew and there are different recipes but the basic ingredients used in all of them are the baked beans and then extra ingredients are added. \n\nMexico\n\nSlow cooked stew with south-of-the-border flavors features tender beef, corn, beans, and salsa to make a satisfying dish.\n\n\n"}

They can open so that the tips separate at fixed distances, corresponding to various lengths of marching pace, such as \"double march\", \"quick march\", \"step short\", etc. When opened to the correct pace length, the pace stick can be held alongside the holder's body by the hinge, with one leg of the stick vertical to the ground, and the other leg pointing forward. By twirling the stick while marching, the stick can be made to \"walk\" alongside its holder at the proper pace.\n\nOtherwise, while on parade or when marching, it is normally carried tucked tightly under the left arm and parallel to the ground, with the left hand grasping the stick near the top.\n\nThe pace stick is usually permitted to be carried off the parade ground by the regimental sergeant major alone; however, at a particular regiment's discretion, other sergeants and sergeant-majors or equivalent may carry a pace stick if they are qualified drill instructors.\n\nWithin the police forces of Australia, the college sergeant and drill instructors of the Australian Federal Police, the drill sergeant of the Victoria Police Academy and the academy senior protocol officer of the New South Wales Police Academy, holding the rank of senior sergeant and hence the highest senior non-commissioned officer carries the pace stick as a badge of office.\n\nThe origin of the pace stick is claimed by the Royal Regiment of Artillery, who used a \"gunner's stick\" to measure the distance between guns in the field.

The decorative \"charms\" usually carry personal or sentimental attachment by the owner.\n\nThe wearing of charms may have begun as a form of amulet or talisman to ward off evil spirits or bad luck.\n\nDuring the pre-historic period, jewellery charms would be made from shells, animal-bones and clay. Later charms were made out of gems, rocks, and wood.\n\nFor instance, there is evidence from Africa that shells were used for adornments around 75,000 years ago. In Germany intricately carved mammoth tusk charms have been found from around 30,000 years ago. In ancient Egypt charms were used for identification and as symbols of faith and luck. Charms also served to identify an individual to the gods in the afterlife.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, Christians would use tiny fish charms hidden in their clothing to identify themselves to other Christians. Jewish scholars of the same period would write tiny passages of Jewish law and put them in amulets round their necks to keep the law close to their heart at all times. Medieval knights wore charms for protection in battle. Charms also were worn in the Dark Ages to denote family origin and religious and political convictions.\n\nCharm bracelets have been the subject of several waves of trends. The first charm bracelets were worn by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, and Hittites and began appearing from 600 – 400 BC.\n\nFor example, Queen Victoria wore charm bracelets that started a fashion among the European noble classes. She was instrumental to the popularity of charm bracelets, as she “loved to wear and give charm bracelets. When her beloved Prince Albert died, she even made “mourning” charms popular; lockets of hair from the deceased, miniature portraits of the deceased, charm bracelets carved in jet.”\n\nIn 1889, Tiffany and Co. introduced their first charm bracelet — a link bracelet with a single heart dangling from it, a bracelet which is an iconic symbol for Tiffany today.\n\nDespite the Great Depression, during the 1920s and 1930s platinum and diamonds were introduced to charm bracelet manufacturing.\n\nSoldiers returning home after World War II brought home trinkets made by craftsmen local to the area where they were fighting to give to loved ones. American teenagers in the 1950s and early 1960s collected charms to record the events in their lives. Screen icons like Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Crawford helped to fuel the interest and popularity of charm bracelets.\n\nAlthough interest and production waned through the latter part of the 20th century, there was a resurgence of popularity after 2000 and collectors eagerly sought out vintage charms. Inspired by the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", bracelets with little charms of swords, crosses and skulls were introduced as a fashion trend during winter 2006.\n\nA charm is a small ornament usually dangling from a bracelet or chain. However, the Italian charm bracelet is configured differently. While each charm is separate and interchangeable, it lies flat against the wrist and is interlocking to the next charm, similarly to an expansion band. A charm-link connecting tool is available to change the charms, but fingers seem to work just as well.\n\n\n"}

In 1952, Ivan Deu, the Director of the state-owned corporation Slovenijavino, came up with the idea of producing an original, refreshing Slovenian beverage which would be able to compete against soft drinks from abroad (that is, the United States; i.e. Coca-Cola company and its subsidiary beverage companies), which were not yet being sold in Yugoslavia. The chemical engineer, Emerik Zelinka, an employee of the Slovenijavino research labs, created the drink with a new, different taste, derived from a blend of eleven different herbs and spices; including the rose hip, a prominent flavour within Cockta's blend. The drink was introduced to the market for the first time on 8 March 1953 at a Ski jumping competition at\nPlanica. \n\nIn 2000, the Cockta brand was bought by the Kolinska food company, known today as Droga Kolinska d.d.. In mid 2010, Croatian holding company Atlantic Grupa d.d. acquired Droga Kolinska. \nIn the first year of production, four million Cockta bottles were sold in Slovenia alone, and ten years later, sales climbed to 71 million. From Slovenia, Cockta spread at the common market of other republics of Yugoslavia, but there hasn't been established proprietary bottling facilities.\n\nThe initial Cockta launch and marketing campaign was carefully designed. The first bottle and label for Yugo Cockta was created by Sergej Pavlin, then a young architecture student. Pavlin also designed other marketing collateral, including the design for Cockta delivery trucks and cardboard packaging for Cockta's bottles. \n\nMany older Slovenes still remember the posters which swept the entire country as part of the original Cockta marketing campaign: they featured a suntanned young woman, with a hairstyle considered trendy at the time, in a pony tail, with blue eyes, holding in her hands a bottle of the mysterious new beverage. The sports event at Planica where Cockta was launched was the earliest form of sports sponsorship in Slovenia.\n\nIn 2006, Cockta sponsored the MaxCards World Championships, held in Ljubljana.\n\nIn 2013 a survey conducted by Valicon placed Cockta 6th in a list of the top 25 strongest brands in Slovenia.

Simit's size, crunch, chewiness, and other characteristics vary slightly by region. It is widely known as Turkish bagel in United States.\n\nIn İzmir, simit is known as \"gevrek\" (\"crisp\"), although it is very similar to the Istanbul variety. Simit in Ankara are smaller and crisper than those of other cities. Simit in Istanbul are made with molasses.\n\nThe word \"simit\" comes from Arabic \"samīd\" () \"white bread\" or \"fine flour\".\n\nOther names are based on the Greek \"koulouri\" (κουλούρι): Aramaic \"qeluro/qelora\"; or the Turkish \"gevrek\": South Slavic \"đevrek\", ђеврек, \"gjevrek\", ѓеврек, геврек. The Armenian name is \"բոկեղ\" [bokegh]. In Judaeo-Spanish it is known as \"roskas turkas\".\n\n\"Simit\" has a long history in Istanbul. Archival sources show that the \"simit\" has been produced in Istanbul since 1525. Based on Üsküdar court records (Şer’iyye Sicili) dated 1593, the weight and price of simit was standardized for the first time. The 17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote that there were 70 simit bakeries in Istanbul during the 1630s. Jean Brindesi's early 19th-century oil paintings about Istanbul daily life show simit sellers on the streets. Warwick Goble, too, made an illustration of these simit sellers of Istanbul in 1906. Simit and its variants became popular across the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSimit is generally served plain, or for breakfast with tea, fruit preserves, or cheese or ayran. Drinking tea with simit is traditional. Simit (\"Bokegh\" in Armenian) is a traditional Christmas bread in Armenia.\n\nSimit are sold by street vendors in Turkey, who either have a simit trolley or carry the simit in a tray on their head. Street merchants generally advertise simit as fresh (\"\"Taze simit!\"\"/\"\"Taze gevrek!\"\") since they are baked throughout the day; otherwise hot (\"\"Sıcak, sıcak!\"\") and extremely hot (\"\"El yakıyor!\"\" means \"It burns the hand!\") when they are not long out of the oven.\n\nSimit is an important symbol for lower and middle-class people of Turkey. Sometimes it is called \"susam kebabı\" (\"sesame kebab\").\n\nIn other parts of the middle east it is consumed with boiled eggs and /or duggah which is a mixture of herbs used as condiments, it is commonly used as a break of fast in holy makkah and Madeenah mosques with yoghurt or buttermilk.\n\nCertain varieties of Romanian covrigi are similar to simit.\n\nAnother type of bread similar to simit is known as \"obwarzanek\" (in particular \"obwarzanek krakowski\") in Poland and \"bublik\" in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The main difference is that the rings of dough are poached briefly in boiling water prior to baking (similarly to bagels), instead of being dipped in water and molasses syrup, as is the case with simit.\n\nGirde (Uygur: Гирде), is a type of bread baked on the walls of tandoori oven, that is very similar to simit, and that the Uyghurs in China see as a characteristic item in their culture-specific kitchen.\n\n"}

In 1274 the council of Lyons imposed a tax of a tenth part of all church revenues during the six following years for the relief of the Holy Land. In Scotland, Pope Gregory X, entrusted the collection of this tax to Master Boiamund (better known as Bagimund) de Vitia, a canon of Asti, whose roll of valuation formed the basis of ecclesiastical taxation for some centuries.\n\nBoiamund proposed to assess the tax, not according to the old conventional valuation but on the true value of the benefices at the time of assessment. The clergy of Scotland objected to this innovation, and, having held a council at Perth in August 1275, prevailed upon Boiamund to return to Rome for the purpose of persuading the pope to accept the older method of taxation. The pope insisted upon the tax being collected according to the true value, and Boiamund returned to Scotland to superintend its collection.\n\nA fragment of Bagimond's Roll in something very like its original form is preserved at Durham, and has been printed by James Raine in his \"Priory of Coldingham\" (Publications of the Surtees Society, vol. xii.). It gives the real values in one column and tenth parts in another column of each of the benefices in the archdeaconry of Lothian: The actual taxation to which this fragment refers was not the tenth collected by Boiamund but the tenth of all ecclesiastical property in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland granted by Pope Nicholas IV to Edward I of England in the year 1288. The fragment should therefore be regarded as supplementary to the \"Taxatio Ecclesiastics Angliae et Walliae\" printed by the Record Commissioners in 1802. Although no contemporary copy of Bagimond's Roll is known to exist, at least three documents give particulars of the taxation of the Church of Scotland in the 16th century, which are based upon the original roll.\n\n"}

(The other variety originated in Bologna and is known in Italian as \"ragù bolognese\" or \"ragù alla bolognese\".)\n\nThe Neapolitan type is made from three main parts: a soffritto, meat, and tomato sauce. However, a major difference is how the meat is used, as well as the amount of tomato in the sauce. Bolognese versions use very finely chopped meat, while Neapolitan versions use whole meat, taking it from the casserole when cooked and serving it as a second course or with pasta. Also, the Neapolitan soffritto contains much more onion compared to the Bolognese. Preferences for ingredients also differ. In Naples, white wine is replaced by red wine, butter by lard or olive oil, and lots of basil leaves are used where Bolognese ragù has no herbs. In the Neapolitan recipe, the content may well be enriched by adding raisins, pine nuts, and involtini with different fillings. Milk or cream is not used, and a relative abundance of tomato sauce in flavour, in contrast to Bolognese use of a minimal amount, is preferred. The tomato season is much longer in more southern Naples than in more northern Bologna. Like the Bolognese, Neapolitan ragù also has quite a wide range of variants, the best known of which is \"ragù guardaporta\" (doorman's ragù).\n\nNeapolitan ragù has many similarities with, and is ancestral to, the Italian-American \"Sunday gravy\", the primary difference being the addition of a greater variety of meat in the American version, most famously meatballs (whence spaghetti and meatballs), braciole, sausage, and pork chops.\n"}

The liver used is generally calf, beef, or chicken. The quintessential fat used is schmaltz, but different methods and materials exist, and the exact process and ingredients may vary from chef to chef. \nShortening or oil is often substituted for the schmaltz.\n\nChopped liver is often served on mazza, or with rye bread as sandwiches.\n\nChopped liver is high in protein but also high in fat and cholesterol. Thus, low fat versions and mock and vegetarian alternatives exist that are frequently made of a combination of peas, string beans, eggplant, or mushrooms. Parve alternatives include the Israeli eggplant salad and vorschmack (chopped herring).\n\nSince eating chopped liver may not be appreciated by everyone, the Jewish English expression \"What am \"I\", chopped \"liver\"?\", signifies frustration or anger at being ignored on a social level.\n\nAn explanation of the expression is that chopped liver was traditionally served as a side dish rather than a main course. The phrase, therefore may have originally meant to express a feeling of being overlooked, as a \"side dish\".\n\nThe etymology of the idiom is difficult to trace, with much of spoken references in older television, comedy and cinema unavailable in text form.

Corn tortillas are generally used to make taquitos; the dish is more commonly known as flautas when they are larger than their taquito counterparts, and can be made with either flour or corn tortillas although using corn is more traditional.\n\nThe taquito or small taco was referred to in the 1917 \"Preliminary Glossary of New Mexico Spanish\", with the word noted as a \"Mexicanism\" used in New Mexico. The modern definition of a taquito as a rolled-tortilla dish was given in 1929 in a book of stories of Mexican people in the United States aimed at a youth audience, where the dish was noted as a particularly popular offering of railroad station vendors.

It makes use of a chain transfer agent in the form of a thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization is one of several living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.\n\nThe addition-fragmentation chain transfer process was first reported in the early 1970s. However, the technique was irreversible, so the transfer reagents could not be used to control radical polymerization at this time. For the first few years addition-fragmentation chain transfer was used to help synthesize end-functionalized polymers.\n\nScientists began to realize the potential of RAFT in controlled radical polymerization in the 1980s. Macromonomers were known as reversible chain transfer agents during this time, but had limited applications on controlled radical polymerization.\n\nIn 1995, a key step in the \"degenerate\" reversible chain transfer step for chain equilibration was brought to attention. The essential feature is that the product of chain transfer is also a chain transfer agent with similar activity to the precursor transfer agent.\n\nRAFT polymerization today is mainly carried out by thiocarbonylthio chain transfer agents. It was first reported by Rizzardo \"et al.\" in 1998. RAFT is one of the most versatile methods of controlled radical polymerization because it is tolerant of a very wide range of functionality in the monomer and solvent, including aqueous solutions. RAFT polymerization has also been effectively carried out over a wide temperature range.\n\nTypically, a RAFT polymerization system consists of:\n\nA temperature is chosen such that (a) chain growth occurs at an appropriate rate, (b) the chemical initiator (radical source) delivers radicals at an appropriate rate and (c) the central RAFT equilibrium (see later) favors the active rather than dormant state to an acceptable extent.\n\nRAFT polymerization can be performed by adding a chosen quantity of an appropriate RAFT agent to a conventional free radical polymerization. Usually the same monomers, initiators, solvents and temperatures can be used.\n\nRadical initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ACVA), also called 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid), are widely used as the initiator in RAFT.\n\nFigure 3 provides a visual description of RAFT polymerizations of poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyacrylic acid using AIBN as the initiator and two RAFT agents.\n\nRAFT polymerization is known for its compatibility with a wide range of monomers compared to other controlled radical polymerizations. These monomers include (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, acrylonitrile, styrene and derivatives, butadiene, vinyl acetate and N-vinylpyrrolidone. The process is also suitable for use under a wide range of reaction parameters such as temperature or the level of impurities, as compared to NMP or ATRP.\n\nThe Z and R group of a RAFT agent must be chosen according to a number of considerations. The Z group primarily affects the stability of the S=C bond and the stability of the adduct radical (Polymer-S-C•(Z)-S-Polymer, see section on Mechanism). These in turn affect the position of and rates of the elementary reactions in the pre- and main-equilibrium. The R group must be able to stabilize a radical such that the right hand side of the pre-equilibrium is favored, but unstable enough that it can reinitiate growth of a new polymer chain. As such, a RAFT agent must be designed with consideration of the monomer and temperature, since both these parameters also strongly influence the kinetics and thermodynamics of the RAFT equilibria.\n\nThe desired product of a RAFT polymerization is typically linear polymer with an R-group at one end and a dithiocarbonate moiety at the other end. Figure 4 depicts the major and minor products of a RAFT polymerization. All other products arise from (a) biradical termination events or (b) reactions of chemical species that originate from initiator fragments, denoted by I in the figure. (Note that categories (a) and (b) intersect).\n\nThe selectivity towards the desired product can be increased by increasing the concentration of RAFT agent relative to the quantity of free radicals delivered during the polymerization. This can be done either directly (i.e. by increasing the RAFT agent concentration) or by decreasing the rate of decomposition of or concentration of initiator.\n\nRAFT is a type of living polymerization involving a conventional radical polymerization which is mediated by a RAFT agent. Monomers must be capable of radical polymerization. There are a number of steps in a RAFT polymerization: initiation, pre-equilibrium, re-initiation, main equilibrium, propagation and termination.\n\nThe mechanism is now explained further with the help of Figure 5.\n\nInitiation: The reaction is started by a free-radical source which may be a decomposing radical initiator such as AIBN. In the example in Figure 5, the initiator decomposes to form two fragments (I•) which react with a single monomer molecule to yield a propagating (i.e. growing) polymeric radical of length 1, denoted P•.\n\nPropagation: Propagating radical chains of length \"n\" in their active (radical) form, P•, add to monomer, M, to form longer propagating radicals, P•.\n\nRAFT pre-equilibrium: A polymeric radical with n monomer units (P) reacts with the RAFT agent to form a RAFT adduct radical. This may undergo a fragmentation reaction in either direction to yield either the starting species or a radical (R•) and a polymeric RAFT agent (S=C(Z)S-P). This is a reversible step in which the intermediate RAFT adduct radical is capable of losing either the R group (R•) or the polymeric species (P•).\n\nRe-initiation: The leaving group radical (R•) then reacts with another monomer species, starting another active polymer chain.\n\nMain RAFT equilibrium: This is the most important part in the RAFT process, in which, by a process of rapid interchange, the present radicals (and hence opportunities for polymer chain growth) are \"shared\" among all species that have not yet undergone termination (P• and S=C(Z)S-P). Ideally the radicals are shared equally, causing chains to have equal opportunities for growth and a narrow PDI.\n\nTermination: Chains in their active form react via a process known as bi-radical termination to form chains that cannot react further, known as dead polymer. Ideally, the RAFT adduct radical is sufficiently hindered such that it does not undergo termination reactions.\n\nThe position of the main RAFT equilibrium (Figure 5) is affected by the relative stabilities of the RAFT adduct radical (P-S-C•(Z)-S-P) and its fragmentation products, namely S=C(Z)S-P and polymeric radical (P•). If formation of the RAFT adduct radical is sufficiently thermodynamically favorable, the concentration of active species, P•, will be reduced to the extent that a reduction in the rate of conversion of monomer into polymer is also observed, as compared to an equivalent polymerization without RAFT agent. Such a polymerization, is referred to as a rate-retarded RAFT polymerization.\n\nThe rate of a RAFT polymerization, that is, the rate of conversion of monomer into polymer, mainly depends on the rate of the Propagation reaction (Figure 5) because the rate of initiation and termination are much higher than the rate of propagation. The rate of propagation is proportional to the concentration, [P•], of the active species P•, whereas the rate of the termination reaction, being second order, is proportional to the square [P•]. This means that during rate-retarded RAFT polymerizations, the rate of formation of termination products is suppressed to a greater extent than the rate of chain growth.\n\nIn RAFT polymerizations without rate-retardation, the concentration of the active species P• is close to that in an equivalent conventional polymerization in the absence of RAFT agent.\n\nThe main RAFT equilibrium and hence the rate retardation of the reaction is influenced by both temperature and chemical factors. A high temperature favors formation of the fragmentation products rather than the adduct radical P-S-C•(Z)-S-P. RAFT agents with a radical stabilising Z-group such as Phenyl group favor the adduct radical, as do propagating radicals whose monomers lack radical stabilising features, for example Vinyl acetate.\n\nIn terms of mechanism, an ideal RAFT polymerization has several features. The pre-equilibrium and re-initiation steps are completed very early in the polymerization meaning that the major product of the reaction (the RAFT polymer chains, RAFT-P), all start growing at approximately the same time. The forward and reverse reactions of the main RAFT equilibrium are fast, favoring equal growth opportunities amongst the chains. The total number of radicals delivered to the system by the initiator during the course of the polymerization is low compared to the number of RAFT agent molecules, meaning that the R group initiated polymer chains from the re-initiation step form the majority of the chains in the system, rather than initiator fragment bearing chains formed in the Initiation step. This is important because initiator decomposes continuously during the polymerization, not just at the start, and polymer chains arising from initiator decomposition cannot, therefore, have a narrow length distribution. These mechanistic features lead to an average chain length that increases linearly with the conversion of monomer into polymer.\n\nIn contrast to other controlled radical polymerizations (for example ATRP), a RAFT polymerization does not achieve controlled evolution of molecular weight and low polydispersity by reducing bi-radical termination events (although in some systems, these events may indeed be reduced somewhat, as outlined above), but rather, by ensuring that most polymer chains start growing at approximately the same time and experience equal growth during polymerization.\n\nRAFT polymerization has been used to synthesize a wide range of polymers with controlled molecular weight and low polydispersities (between 1.05 and 1.4 for many monomers).\n\nRAFT polymerization is known for its compatibility with a wide range of monomers as compared to other controlled radical polymerizations. Some monomers capable of polymerizing by RAFT include styrenes, acrylates, acrylamides, and many vinyl monomers. Additionally, the RAFT process allows the synthesis of polymers with specific macromolecular architectures such as block, gradient, statistical, comb, brush, star, hyperbranched, and network copolymers. These properties make RAFT useful in many types of polymer synthesis.\n\nAs with other living radical polymerization techniques, RAFT allows chain extension of a polymer of one monomer with a second type of polymer to yield a block copolymer. In such a polymerisation, there is the additional challenge that the RAFT agent for the first monomer must also be suitable for the second monomer, making block copolymerisation of monomers of highly disparate character challenging.\n\nMultiblock copolymers have also been reported by using difunctional R groups or symmetrical trithiocarbonates with difunctional Z groups.\n\nUsing a compound with multiple dithio moieties (often termed a multifunctional RAFT agent) can result in the formation of star, brush and comb polymers. Taking star polymers as an example, RAFT differs from other forms of living radical polymerization techniques in that either the R- or Z-group may form the core of the star (See Figure 7). While utilizing the R-group as the core results in similar structures found using ATRP or NMP, the ability to use the Z-group as the core makes RAFT unique. When the Z-group is used, the reactive polymeric arms are detached from the star's core during growth and to undergo chain transfer, must once again react at the core.\n\nDue to its flexibility with respect to the choice of monomers and reaction conditions, the RAFT process competes favorably with other forms of living polymerization for the generation of bio-materials. New types of polymers are able to be constructed with unique properties, such as temperature and pH sensitivity.\n\nSpecific materials and their applications include polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates, mediation of enzyme activity, molecular recognition processes and polymeric micelles which can deliver a drug to a specific site in the body.\nRAFT has also been used to graft polymer chains onto polymeric surfaces, for example, polymeric microspheres.\n\nPolymerization can be performed in large range of solvents (including water), within a wide temperature range, high functional group tolerance and absence metals for polymerization. As of 2014, the range of commercially available RAFT agents covers close to all the monomer classes that can undergo radical polymerization.\n\nA particular RAFT agent is only suitable for a limited set of monomers and the synthesis of a RAFT agent typically requires a multistep synthetic procedure and subsequent purification. RAFT agents can be unstable over long time periods, are highly colored and can have a pungent odor due to gradual decomposition of the dithioester moiety to yield small sulfur compounds. The presence of sulfur and color in the resulting polymer may also be undesirable for some applications; however, this can, to an extent, be eliminated with further chemical and physical purification steps.\n\n"}

Before the development of electric refrigerators, \"iceboxes\" were referred to by the public as refrigerators. Only after the invention of the modern day electric refrigerator did the early non electric refrigerators become known as an icebox. \n\nIceboxes, invented by Thomas Moore in 1802, have hollow walls that are lined with tin or zinc and packed with various insulating materials such as cork, sawdust, straw or seaweed. A large block of ice is held in a tray or compartment near the top of the box. Cold air circulates down and around storage compartments in the lower section. Some finer models have spigots for draining ice water from a catch pan or holding tank. In cheaper models a drip pan is placed under the box and has to be emptied at least daily. The user has to replenish the melted ice, normally by obtaining new ice from an iceman.\n\nIceboxes are commonly made of wood; many are handsome pieces of furniture.\n\nIceboxes date back to the days of ice harvesting, which had hit an industrial high that ran from the mid-19th century until the 1930s, when the refrigerator was introduced into the home. Most municipally consumed ice was harvested in winter from snow-packed areas or frozen lakes, stored in ice houses, and delivered domestically. In 1827 the commercial ice cutter was invented, which increased the ease and efficiency of harvesting natural ice. This invention made ice cheaper and in turn helped the icebox become more common. Various companies appeared including Sears, The Baldwin Refrigerator Company, and the Ranney Refrigerator Company started up to get into the icebox manufacturing industry. In 1907 survey of expenditures of New York City inhabitants, 81% of the families surveyed were found to possess \"refrigerators\" either in the form of ice stored in a tub or iceboxes. The widespread use of iceboxes was partially credited with reduction of US infant mortality in summer months.\n\nWith metropolitan growth, many sources of natural ice became contaminated from industrial pollution or sewer runoff. As early mechanical refrigerators became available, they were installed as large industrial plants producing ice for home delivery. Able to produce clean, sanitary ice year-round, their product gradually replaced ice harvested from ponds.\n\nWith widespread electrification and safer refrigerants, mechanical refrigeration in the home became possible. With the development of the chlorofluorocarbons (along with the succeeding hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons), that came to replace the use of toxic ammonia gas, the refrigerator replaced the icebox, though \"icebox\" is still sometimes used to refer to mechanical refrigerators.\n\n\n"}

Today, the secret recipe is withheld from all but one employee at Elsenham Quality Foods in Elsenham, England, the licensed manufacturer.\n\nGentleman's Relish is traditionally eaten thinly spread on slices of buttered white-bread toast, either on its own, or with cucumber or \"mustard and cress\" sprouts. It can also be added to minced meat for a different-tasting cottage pie or to the mixture for fish cakes, potato cakes and croquettes. Alternatively it can be melted into scrambled eggs or be used as a topping for jacket potatoes.

It was created by the Balfours bakery in 1922, and soon became a popular treat in South Australia. Originally frog cakes were available exclusively in green, but later brown and pink were added to the range. Since then other variations have been developed, including seasonal varieties (such as snowmen and Easter \"chicks\"). The frog cake has been called \"uniquely South Australian\", and has been employed in promoting the state. In recognition of its cultural significance, in 2001 the frog cake was listed as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia.\n\nThe frog cake is a small dessert shaped to resemble a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream and covered with a thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.\n\nHaving traveled to France in the early 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who was one of the co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a time in which tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.\n\nThe original frog cakes were green in colour, and green remains the most popular of the options, but chocolate and pink coloured versions were later added to the range. In addition, while the frog motif dominates, special occasions have resulted in slightly different designs – such as Father Christmas and Snowman cakes released during Christmas seasons and \"Chick\" cakes around Easter. Frog cakes have also been released in the colours of the Adelaide Football Club.\n\nFrog cakes have long been regarded as a South Australian icon, and have at times been used to help promote the state. For example, in 2001 frog cakes were given to judges during Joan Hall's final pitch in a successful bid to win the 2007 World Police and Fire Games for Adelaide. While there have been tongue-in-cheek and satirical suggestions to build monuments to the frog cake, such as that made by Peter Goers, a more realistic recognition of the frog cake came in 2001 when it was one of the first items to be selected as a South Australian Icon by the National Trust of South Australia during the 165th anniversary of the state, adding the frog cake to the National Heritage Listing as a \"movable asset\".\n\nHistorically, the frog cake has sold well for Balfours, and at times sales have peaked in response to events surrounding the company. When the company was placed into receivership in 2000, a column in \"The Advertiser\" by Rex Jory called for people to support the company by purchasing the cakes, and in response sales doubled to an \"all-time high\". Similarly, the 2001 inclusion of the frog cake as a South Australian icon saw a comparable increase in sales. The success of the frog cake has led to imitations, and in response Balfours registered both the name and the shape of the product as a trademark in 2001.\n\n\n"}

Thus the nested case–control study is more efficient than the full cohort design. The nested case–control study can be analyzed using methods for missing covariates.\n\nThe NCC design is often used when the exposure of interest is difficult or expensive to obtain and when the outcome is rare. By utilizing data previously collected from a large cohort study, the time and cost of beginning a new case–control study is avoided. By only measuring the covariate in as many participants as necessary, the cost and effort of exposure assessment is reduced. This benefit is pronounced when the covariate of interest is biological, since assessments such as gene expression profiling are expensive, and because the quantity of blood available for such analysis is often limited, making it a valuable resource that should not be used unnecessarily.\n\nAs an example, of the 91,523 women in the Nurses' Health Study who did not have cancer at baseline and who were followed for 14 years, 2,341 women had developed breast cancer by 1993. Several studies have used standard cohort analyses to study precursors to breast cancer, e.g. use of hormonal contraceptives, which is a covariate easily measured on all of the women in the cohort. However, note that in comparison to the cases, there are so many controls that each particular control contributes relatively little information to the analysis.\n\nIf, on the other hand, one is interested in the association between gene expression and breast cancer incidence, it would be very expensive and possibly wasteful of precious blood specimen to assay all 89,000 women without breast cancer. In this situation, one may choose to assay all of the cases, and also, for each case, select a certain number of women to assay from the risk set of participants who have not yet failed (i.e. those who have not developed breast cancer before the particular case in question has developed breast cancer). The risk set is often restricted to those participants who are matched to the case on variables such as age, which reduces the variability of effect estimates.\n\nCommonly 1–4 controls are selected for each case. Since the covariate is not measured for all participants, the nested case–control model is both less expensive than a full cohort analysis and more efficient than taking a simple random sample from the full cohort. However, it has been shown that with 4 controls per case and/or stratified sampling of controls, relatively little efficiency may be lost, depending on the method of estimation used.\n\nThe analysis of a nested case–control model must take into account the way in which controls are sampled from the cohort. Failing to do so, such as by treating the cases and selected controls as the original cohort and performing a logistic regression, which is common, can result in biased estimates whose null distribution is different from what is assumed. Ways to account for the random sampling include conditional logistic regression, and using inverse probability weighting to adjust for missing covariates among those who are not selected into the study.\n\nA case–cohort study is a design in which cases and controls are drawn from within a prospective study. All cases who developed the outcome of interest during the follow-up are selected and compared with a random sample of the cohort. This randomly selected control sample could, by chance, include some cases. Exposure is defined prior to disease development based on data collected at baseline or on assays conducted in biological samples collected at baseline.\n"}

The modern dish was adapted during the colonial era between the 16th and 19th centuries and can now be found in Peru.\n\nAnticuchos can be found on street-carts and street food stalls (\"anticucheras\"). The meat may be marinated in vinegar and spices (such as cumin, ají pepper and garlic). While anticuchos can be made of any type of meat, the most popular are made of beef heart (\"anticuchos de corazón\"). Anticuchos often come with a boiled potato or bread on the end of the skewer. A similar dish, shish kebab, is found in Mediterranean cuisine. In Peru, anticuchos are linked to the procession of Señor de los Milagros.\n\nAlthough Anticuchos are of Pre-Columbian origin, historically Anticuchos can be traced as far back as the 16th century, when they were first encountered by the Spanish conquistadors. It was at this time that European ingredients such as garlic were added, and beef began to replace the traditional llama that was used at the time of the Inca Empire. It was a popular dish among the inhabitants of the Inca Empire, and it is currently popular throughout most South American countries. Americanized versions of anticuchos are sometimes made of non-organ meats.\n\nAccording to the text file from the National Library in Lima (Peru), it is believed that the term comes from the Quechua \"antikuchu\" (\"anti\": 'East' + \"kuchu\": 'cut' or \"uchu\": 'porridge, mix'). The writer Erika Fetzer mentions that according to tradition, anticuchos were prepared with meat and flame. The Spanish strung the meat on sticks as skewers.\n\nThe Spaniards also brought enslaved blacks, which were established in Lima and the coast of southern Chico de la Ciudad de los Reyes of the Vice-royalty of Peru. They adopted this dish.\n\nIn those days the Spanish dismissed offal as food for slaves, using non-offal meats out of the desire to have a dish that was more attractive to them. The presently used recipe, with its traditional flavor, specifically uses beef heart. In Peru, the tradition continues with the traditional name and ingredients; anticuchos are consumed by all social classes of Peru, and is especially popular as a street food.\n\nPeruvian Ricardo Palma's speeches, Tradiciones Peruanos were published in 1833, mention the sale of anticuchos at 3 in the afternoon.\n\nTraditional anticuchos are made with beef chunks of about 5 × 5 cm and onions, roasted on a metal skewer about long and 3 × 3 mm in diameter.\n\nAnticuchos are commonly prepared with different types of beef and to a lesser extent with chicken, usually cut into pieces of 2 x 2 cm, threaded on a skewer of no more than long, with pieces of vienna sausage and vegetables such as onions, peppers, carrots and mushrooms alternated on the skewer, just like cooking meat on a barbecue (asado).\n\nUsually they're seasoned with salt to taste and sometimes with vinegar or lemon juice.\nA popular dressing is a sauce made from garlic, onion and chopped cilantro, vinegar, lemon juice and beer, which is spread onto the anticuchos with a sprig of parsley.\n\nAnticuchos are usually not the main course of a meal, but rather an accompaniment to grilled meats along with other side dishes such as choripanes, potatoes, sausages and salads.\n\nVariants include smaller sticks of wood; those 15 cm or less are called \"meat skewers.\"\n\nAnticuchos are part of traditional Peruvian cuisine. The greatest consumption in Peru is in July, during the celebration of \"Fiestas Patrias\" (Independence day) in fondas and BBQs.\n\nIn Bolivia, anticuchos are made with heart meat (commonly beef or chicken), accompanied with roast potatoes and a type of peanut sauce.\n\n\n"}

Optical rotatory dispersion can be used to find the absolute configuration of metal complexes. For example, when plane-polarized white light from an overhead projector is passed through a cylinder of sucrose solution, a spiral rainbow is observed perpendicular to the cylinder.\n\nWhen white light passes through a polarizer, the extent of rotation of light depends on its wavelength. Short wavelengths are rotated more than longer wavelengths, per unit of distance. Because the wavelength of light determines its color, the variation of color with distance through the tube is observed. This dependence of specific rotation on wavelength is called optical rotatory dispersion. \nIn all materials the rotation varies with wavelength. The variation is caused by two quite different phenomena. The first accounts in most cases for the majority of the variation in rotation and should not strictly be termed rotatory dispersion. It depends on the fact that optical activity is actually circular birefringence. In other words, a substance which is optically active transmits right circularly polarized light with a different velocity from left circularly polarized light.\nIn addition to this pseudodispersion which depends on the material thickness, there is a true rotatory dispersion which depends on the variation with wavelength of the indices of refraction for right and left circularly polarized light.\nFor wavelengths that are absorbed by the optically active sample, the two circularly polarized components will be absorbed to differing extents. This unequal absorption is known as circular dichroism. Circular dichroism causes incident linearly polarized light to become elliptically polarized. The two phenomena are closely related, just as are ordinary absorption and dispersion. If the entire optical rotatory dispersion spectrum is known, the circular dichroism spectrum can be calculated, and vice versa.\n\nIn order for a molecule (or crystal) to exhibit circular birefringence and circular dichroism, it must be distinguishable from its mirror image. An object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image is said to be chiral, and optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism are known as chiroptical properties.\nMost biological molecules have one or more chiral centers and undergo enzyme-catalyzed transformations that either maintain or invert the chirality at one or more of these centers. Still other enzymes produce new chiral centers, always with a high specificity. These properties account for the fact that optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism are widely used in organic and inorganic chemistry and in biochemistry.\nIn the absence of magnetic fields, only chiral substances exhibit optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. In a magnetic field, even substances that lack chirality rotate the plane of polarized light, as shown by Michael Faraday. Magnetic optical rotation is known as the Faraday effect, and its wavelength dependence is known as magnetic optical rotatory dispersion. In regions of absorption, magnetic circular dichroism is observable.\n\n"}

{"id": "2955590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2955590", "title": "Dignitas (Roman concept)", "text": "Dignitas (Roman concept)\n\nDignitas is a Latin word referring to a unique, intangible, and culturally subjective social concept in the ancient Roman mindset. The word does not have a direct translation in English. Some interpretations include \"dignity\", which is a \"derivation\" from \"dignitas\", and \"prestige\" or \"charisma\".\n\nWith respect to ancient Rome, \"dignitas\" was regarded as the sum of the personal clout and influence that a male citizen acquired throughout his life. When weighing the \"dignitas\" of a particular individual, factors such as personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth had to be considered, along with the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment.\n\nAuthors who had used \"dignitas\" extensively in their writings and oratories include Cicero, Julius Caesar, Tacitus, and Livy. The most prolific user was Cicero, who initially related it to the established term \"auctoritas\" (authority). These two words were highly associated, with the latter defined as the expression of a man's \"dignitas\".\n\nThe cultivation of \"dignitas\" in ancient Rome was extremely personal. Men of all classes, most particularly noblemen of consular families, were highly protective and zealous of this asset. This is because every man who took on a higher political office during the Roman Republic considered \"dignitas\" as comprising much more than just his dignity. It referred to his \"good name\" (his past and present reputation, achievement, standing, and honor). Its importance within the hierarchical classes of Roman society meant many historical figures would kill, commit suicide (e.g. Mark Antony), or enter exile in order to preserve their \"dignitas\".\n\nThe personal significance of one's \"dignitas\" had encouraged several conflicts in ancient Rome. Florus claimed that the stubbornness of Cato the Younger had driven Pompeius Magnus to prepare defenses in order to build up his \"dignitas\". Cicero wrote that Caesar valued his status so greatly that he did not want anyone to be his equal in \"dignitas\". Aulus Hirtius had written that Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was one of the instigators of Caesar’s recall from Gaul, had attempted to build all of his own reputation on his success on turning people’s feelings against Caesar. Whether the exact term was used much during these times is unknown; however, the concept of \"dignitas\" was certainly influential and worth fighting for.\n\nOver the course of ancient Roman history, \"dignitas\" had never taken on all of the aforementioned descriptions simultaneously. The term took on different meanings over time, adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society, politicians, and the various authors.\n\nYears after Caesar's death, his heir Augustus rejected the contemporary meaning of \"dignitas\". Augustus found the related term \"auctoritas\" to be a suitable alternative.\n\nIn 46 BC, Cicero cited the ambiguous nature of the concept of \"dignitas\". He wrote, \"And so I have, if loyal feeling for the state and winning good men's approval of those loyal feelings is all that \"dignitas\" amounts to; but if in \"dignitas\" you include the power of translating those loyal feelings into action or of defending them with complete freedom, then \"ne vestigium quidem ullum est reliquum nobis dignitatis\" [not even a trace is left to us of our dignity].\"\n\nWhen paired with the term \"otium\", the word \"dignitas\" took on a different meaning. Cicero did not consider himself worthy of having \"dignitas\" alone because he felt that—by turning his back on the Roman public—he had neglected the duty of one whose life had normally exemplified the concept. He then altered the definition to mean \"[lifetime] impact,\" to better describe his unique status. By this time, Cicero's political life had ended, and he labeled his past political influence as his \"dignitas\", and his present standing as \"otium\".\n\n\n"}

Originally known as the Kenya Coffee Company, they started distributing coffee to Britain in 1923. Shortly after, they opened a coffee shop in Sloane Square and then changed their name to Kenco in 1962.\n\nIn 2008 the brand was relaunched with 75% of the beans for its instant range being sourced from Rainforest Alliance certified farms. The company sources their coffee beans from Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.\n\nKenco was founded in 1923 by a co-operative of retired White Kenyan coffee growers who traded as \"The Kenya Coffee Company Limited\". Soon, L.C. Gibbs and C.S. Baines began selling coffee from a shop in Vere Street, Mayfair. The shop sold roast and ground coffee locally but most of its sales were by mail order - selling coffee to country houses using advertisements in publications like \"Tatler\", \"Country Life\" and \"The Times\".\n\nAs demand increased, the company moved to number 30 Sloane Street, London, next door to a food merchants called John Gardiner. Gardiner ran a food wholesale business, restaurants and provided outdoor catering at events such as the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.\n\nAfter World War II, Tom Kelly, a Gardiner employee, persuaded the company to buy the Kenya Coffee Company. On completion of the deal, Tom Kelly was put in charge of the new business and he expanded the retail chain. As well as selling coffee by mail order and from the Sloane Street premises, Kelly diversified into catering and opened eleven coffee shops in locations such as Wimbledon, King’s Road and Golders Green. These Kenya Coffee Company shops may well have been the first branded high street coffee shops in the UK. In the 1960s, the cafes were thriving, selling not only coffee but all sorts of cakes as well. Besides the coffee shop activity, Tom Kelly also acquired the rights to sell Gaggia machines, and so the company started to sell espresso machines to other coffee bars.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Kenyan Coffee Company changed its name into the Kenco Coffee Company, to reflect the fact that the amount of coffee the company bought from Kenya was decreasing.\n\nBefore being owned by Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the brand was owned by Mondelēz International, General Foods and before that Premier Brands.\n"}

It takes the shape of a small, striated cylinder up to five centimeters in height with a depression at the top. A specialty of the Bordeaux region of France, today it is widely available in pâtisseries in France and abroad.\n\nThe canelé is believed to originate from the , Bordeaux in either the 15th or the 18th century. The modern word \"canelé\" originates in Gascon, which was spoken in Bordeaux and a large area of southwestern France until the 19th century.\n\nIn Limoges, there was a food called \"canole\", a bread made with flour and egg yolks, which may be the same item as that sold in Bordeaux since the 18th century under the name of \"canaule\", also written \"canaulé\" or \"canaulet\". Artisans known as \"canauliers\" who specialized in baking them registered a Corporation (or guild) with the Parliament of Bordeaux in 1663, which allowed only them to produce several specific foods: \"Blessed bread\", \"canaules\", and \"Retortillons\". Since they were not a part of the Pastry Corporation (Guild), which had a monopoly over baking with milk and sugar or \"mixtionnée\" dough, they were prohibited from using those ingredients. The \"canauliers\" disputed the Pastry Chefs' privileges and on 3 March 1755 the council of State in Versailles ruled for the \"canauliers\" and ended the Pastry Chefs' monopoly. An edict of 1767 limited the number of authorized \"canaulier\" shops in a city to eight. It created very strict requirements for joining the profession. Nevertheless, in 1785 there were at least 39 \"canaulier\" shops in Bordeaux, at least ten of which were in the district (\"faubourg\") of Saint-Seurin. The French Revolution abolished all the Corporations, but later census rolls continue to show shops of Canauliers and bakers of \"blessed bread\".\n\nIn the first quarter of the 20th century the canelé reappeared, even if it is difficult to date exactly when. An unknown pastry chef re-popularised the antique recipe of \"canauliers\". He added rum and vanilla to his dough. It is likely that its current shape comes from the similarity (in French) of the word wave with the word \"cannelure\" (fluting, corrugation, striations).\n\nThe modern name \"canelé\" is of recent origin. The \"Guide Gourmand de la France\" does not mention it. Only in 1985, after the pastry's popularity had begun to explode, was the Brotherhood of the Canelé of Bordeaux (Confrérie du Canelé de Bordeaux) created and the second \"n\" of its name removed. The name \"canelé\" became a collective brand, registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property of France by the Brotherhood. Ten years after the registration of the brand, there were at least 800 manufacturers in Aquitaine and 600 in the Gironde. In 1992, Gironde alone consumed an estimated 4.5 million canelés.\n\nThe \"canelé\" is traditionally baked in a small cylindrical fluted mold. Traditionally the molds were brushed with beeswax, but today butter is used. Produced in numerous sizes, they can be consumed for breakfast, for snacks, and as a dessert depending in some measure on size. \"Canelés\" can be paired with red wine and many other beverages.\n\nTraditionally, \"canelés\" or \"cannelés of Bordeaux\" are generally sold in bunches of 8 or 16. In Paris, most of the famous shops such as Ladurée and Pierre Hermé still spell it as \"cannelé of Bordeaux\" with double 'n'.\n\n\n"}

It consists of various parts of a duck served in a sauce of its blood and bone marrow, which is extracted by way of a press. It has been considered \"the height of elegance.\"\n\nFirst, a duck (preferably young and plump) is asphyxiated to retain the blood. The duck is then partially roasted. Its liver is ground and seasoned, then the legs and breast are removed. \n\nThe remaining carcass (including other meat, bones, and skin) is then put in a specially-designed press, similar to a wine press. Pressure is then applied to extract duck blood and other juices from the carcass. The extract is thickened and flavoured with the duck's liver, butter, and cognac, and then combined with the breast to finish cooking.\n\nOther ingredients that may be added to the sauce include foie gras, port wine, Madeira wine, and lemon. The breast is sliced and served with the sauce in a first serving; the legs are broiled and served as the next course.\n\nThere is a Cantonese dish of the same name which has a completely different preparation. Blood is not used in this recipe, so the duck is slaughtered and bled as for any other regular preparation. The duck is seasoned and steamed, then deboned. The meat is then flattened, by press or rolling pin, to a uniform thickness of about 3/4 inch. The pressed/rolled duck meat is steamed again, to help keep its shape; then, deep-fried just before serving. The meat can be cut into portion sizes before or after the second steaming, but should already be portion sized at the time it is deep-fried so that it can be served immediately afterward.\n\nCantonese pressed duck is also called Chinese pressed duck, steamed deep-fried pressed duck, and Wor Shu duck/Wor Shu Op.\n\n"}

{"id": "2969191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2969191", "title": "Sisig", "text": "Sisig\n\nSisig is a Kapampangan dish made from parts of pig head and chicken liver, usually seasoned with \"calamansi\" , onions and chili peppers. \"Sisig\" was first mentioned in a Kapampangan dictionary in the 17th Century meaning \"to snack on something sour\" and \"salad\". It usually refers to fruits, often unripe or half-ripe, sometimes dipped in salt and vinegar. It also refers to a method of preparing fish and meat, especially pork, which is marinated in a sour liquid such as lemon juice or vinegar, then seasoned with salt, pepper and other spices.\n\nSisig has been a culinary tradition of Pampanga and the Kapampangan people feel very strongly about it to the point that they declared Sizzling Sisig Babi (pork) as an intangible heritage of Angeles City through a city ordinance (City Ordinance No. 405, Series of 2017 “An ordinance declaring Sizzling Sisig Babi as an intangible cultural heritage of Angeles City, and establishing systems and policies in safeguarding the original recipe of Sizzling Sisig, providing mechanisms of implementation, and for other related purposes”)\n\nSisig is more of a cooking process rather than just the dish. Sisig can be anything,  but the keywords are: sour and snack. The earliest believed record of the word \"sisig\" can be traced back to 1732, and was recorded by Augustinian friar Diego Bergaño in his \"Vocabulary of the Kapampangan Language in Spanish and Dictionary of the Spanish Language in Kapampangan\". Bergaño defines sisig as a \"salad, including green papaya, or green guava eaten with a dressing of salt, pepper, garlic and vinegar.\" There is no mention of how long this cooking style has existed prior to the coming of the Spaniards during the Age of Conquest. The term m\"annisig,\" as in \"mannisig manga\", a phrase still used today refer to eating green mangoes dipped in vinegar.  Back then, it was a snack eaten by pregnant women. Pregnant women enjoy the sourness due to their \"paglilihi\" or pregnancy cravings. Sisig evolved from fruits like papaya, guava or green mangoes to pork (pigs ears). The introduction of meat into the dish does not have an exact date as well.\nLocals believe that the utilization of the pig's head in the dish came from \"recycling\" the excess meat from the commissaries of Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Pampanga. Pig heads were purchased cheap (or free) since they were not used in preparing meals for the U.S. Air Force personnel stationed there during the American Occupation of Luzon and Visayas. Aling Lucing became popular when she grilled the pig's ears,  and adding the use of the cheeks to accommodate the bigger demand, a recipe she learned from the nextdoor stall owner in Crossing, Ricardo \"Bapang Kadok\". Aling Lucing was a very charismatic woman so naturally she had more clientele. The evolution of Sisig moved forward when Benedict Pamintuan of Sugay's also in Angeles City (eventually opened his own restaurant named Benedict's) thought of using a sizzling plate because the pork fat does not turn into sebo (lard) when you eat it as pulutan.  This development catapulted Sisig to a whole new level. Not only is it enjoyed by the taste buds, but the nose (smell from the smoke),  and ears (sizzling sound) as well. \n\nManila got a taste of Sisig when 2 groups of Angelenos brought it there 1) Benedict's family opened a restaurant in Sta Mesa, and 2) Claude Tayag's 2 brothers and a cousin opened Trellis Restaurant in Diliman Quezon City. By this time, Sisig was served with ground grilled chicken liver as well. \n\nSisig still has many variations with recipes varying from city to city, and sometimes, family to family, in the Kapampangan province. In summary, Sisig is not defined by the meat used, any meat, fruits or vegetables may be used.  It is not defined by the cut, you don’t call it Sisig just because it is minced. And it is certainly not because of the plate used, you may serve Sisig on a plate not sizzling.\n\nLucia Cunanan of Angeles City, also known as \"Aling Lucing,\" has been credited with reinventing sisig by grilling the pig's ears, and using the cheeks as well. The Philippine Department of Tourism has acknowledged that her \"Aling Lucing's\" restaurant had established Angeles City as the \"Sisig Capital of the Philippines\" in 1974. Cunanan's trademark sisig was developed in mid-1974 when she served a concoction of grilled and chopped pig ears and cheeks seasoned with vinegar, \"calamansi\" juice, chopped onions and chicken liver and served in hot plates. Today, varieties include \"sisig ala pizzailo\", pork combination, green mussels or \"tahong\", mixed seafood, ostrich \"sisig\", crocodile sisig, spicy python, frog \"sisig\" and \"tokwa't baboy\", among others.\n\nAccording to Cunanan's recipe, preparing \"sisig\" comes in three phases: boiling, broiling and finally grilling. A pig's head is first boiled to remove hairs and to tenderize it. Portions of it are then chopped and grilled or broiled. Finally, coarsely chopped onions are added and served on a sizzling plate. Variations of \"sisig\" may add any of the following: eggs, ox brains, \"chicharon\" (pork cracklings), pork or chicken liver, and mayonnaise. Recently, local chefs have experimented with ingredients other than pork such as chicken, squid, tuna, and tofu.\n\nThe annual \"Sisig Festival\" (\"Sadsaran Qng Angeles\") is held every year during December in Angeles City, Pampanga, celebrating the \"Kapampangan\" dish. It started in 2003 and was made an annual festival by Mayor Carmelo Lazatin on December 2004 to promote the city's culinary prowess. The festival also features a contest where chefs compete in making dishes, primarily sisig. Congo Grille, a restaurant chain in the country, was the winner in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the festival was put on hiatus following Aling Lucing's death. Marquee Mall then incorporated the festival in 2014 by including it within their annual Big Bite! Northern Food Festival held every October or November.\n\nThe Angeles City Tourism Office organized a festival on April 29, 2017. The revival of the festival was in line with the Philippine Department of Tourism’s Flavors of the Philippines campaign. Now called \"Sisig Fiesta,\" the festivities were held at Valdes Street, Angeles City (also known as \"Crossing\" since it was a former railroad track), where Aling Lucing reinvented the dish.\n\nThe newly-revived Sisig Fiesta was a one-day event that will line up a Sisig sampler banquet, Sisig, and BBQ stalls, cooking demonstrations with celebrity chefs, and showcase Angeleño culinary talent through competitions. The event will also include live bands, dancing, and a night market.\n"}

It is also popular for feeding crowds at banquets, parties, and potlucks, due to the ease of bulk preparation and serving flexibility: \"japchae\" can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold from the refrigerator, and can be eaten freshly made or the next day.\n\n\"Japchae\" is commonly served as a \"banchan\" (side dish), though it may also be a main dish. It is sometimes served on a bed of rice: with rice, it is known as \"japchae-bap\" ().\n\nThe Sino-Korean word \"japchae\" (; ) consists of two syllables, \"jap\" (; ) meaning \"mix\" and \"chae\" (; ) meaning \"vegetable\". The Chinese dish name chop suey is a cognate.\n\nAccording to \"Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty\", the name originally referred to a stir-fried vegetable and mushroom dish, first made in the early 17th century by Yi Chung (1568‒1619) for King Gwanghaegun's palace banquet. The king liked the dish so much that he rewarded Yi by promoting him to a high-ranking position, equivalent to the position of secretary of the Treasury, and \"japchae\" became a fixture of Korean royal court cuisine. Cooked without noodles or meat at the time, \"japchae\" was considered a luxurious and elegant dish served to the royal family and high-level officials. Cucumbers, radishes, and shiitake mushrooms were among the vegetables used in this period.\n\n\"Japchae\", like other royal dishes, was eventually adopted into the cuisine of common people. Its popularity increased later in the 20th century when cellophane noodles made from sweet potato starch were introduced to Korea from China. The noodles have since become an integral and primary ingredient of \"japchae\". Beef and other meats have been added to the noodle dish, while experiments and adaptations have led to many noodle-less variations made with seafood, herbs, peppers, bean sprouts, and other ingredients.\n\n\"Dangmyeon\" are pale grey, semi-transparent, chewy and elastic noodles made from sweet potato starch. They are also known as \"glass noodles\", \"cellophane noodles\", or \"sweet potato vermicelli\". The noodles may be soaked in water before cooking. The assortment of vegetables in \"japchae\" may vary, with typical ingredients including carrots, spinach, onions, and scallions. Commonly used mushrooms are wood ear, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. Both beef and pork are commonly used for \"japchae\". Each ingredient is stir-fried separately before being mixed with boiled and drained noodles, and seasoned with soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil. The dish is usually garnished with toasted sesame seeds and chili threads, and served hot or cold.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite this, it is still sometimes referred to as \"Hirnwurst\" (“brain sausage”) in certain parts of Germany. \"Gelbwurst\" is coloured yellowish-white and usually has a yellow or orange skin around its edge.

However, this makes it more difficult to directly beat air into the batter. Therefore, chiffon cakes, like angel cakes and other foam cakes, achieve a fluffy texture by having egg whites beaten separately until stiff and then folded into the cake batter before baking. Its aeration properties rely on both the quality of the meringue and the chemical leaveners.\n\nA chiffon cake combines methods used with sponge cakes and conventional cakes. It includes baking powder and vegetable oil, but the eggs are separated and the whites are beaten before being folded into the batter, creating the rich flavor like an oil cake, but with a lighter texture that is more like a sponge cake. They can be baked in tube pans or layered with fillings and frostings.\n\nThe high oil and egg content create a very moist cake, and as oil is liquid even at cooler temperatures, chiffon cakes do not tend to harden or dry out as traditional butter cakes might. This makes them better-suited than many cakes to filling or frosting with ingredients that need to be refrigerated or frozen, such as pastry cream or ice cream. The lack of butter, however, means that chiffon cakes lack much of the rich flavor of butter cakes\n\nThe recipe is credited to Harry Baker (1883–1974), a California insurance salesman turned caterer. Baker kept the recipe secret for 20 years until he sold it to General Mills, which spread the recipe through marketing materials in the 1940s and 1950s under the name \"chiffon cake\", and a set of 14 recipes and variations was released to the public in a Betty Crocker pamphlet published in 1948.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2974848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2974848", "title": "Shoulder joint", "text": "Shoulder joint\n\nThe shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint from Greek \"glene\", eyeball, + -\"oid\", 'form of', + Latin \"humerus\", shoulder) is structurally classified as a synovial ball and socket joint and functionally as a diarthrosis and multiaxial joint. It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) and the head of the humerus (upper arm bone).\n\nDue to the very loose joint capsule that gives a limited interface of the humerus and scapula, it is the most mobile joint of the human body.\n\nThe shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint between the scapula and the humerus. However the socket of the glenoid cavity of the scapula is itself quite shallow and is made deeper by the addition of the glenoid labrum. The glenoid labrum is a ring of cartilaginous fibre attached to the circumference of the cavity. This ring is continuous with the tendon of the biceps brachii above.\n\nSignificant joint spaces are:\n\n\nThe axillary space is an anatomic space between the associated muscles of the shoulder. This space transmits the subscapular artery and axillary nerve.\n\nThe shoulder joint has a very loose joint capsule known as the articular capsule of the humerus and this can sometimes allow the shoulder to dislocate. The long head of the biceps brachii muscle travels inside the capsule from its attachment to the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula.\n\nBecause the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii is inside the capsule, it requires a tendon sheath to minimize friction.\n\nA number of small fluid-filled sacs known as synovial bursae are located around the capsule to aid mobility:\n\nThe supra-acromial bursa does not normally communicate with the shoulder joint.\n\nThe shoulder joint is a muscle-dependent joint as it lacks strong ligaments. The primary stabilizers of the shoulder include the biceps brachii on the anterior side of the arm, and tendons of the rotator cuff; which are fused to all sides of the capsule except the inferior margin. The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii passes through the bicipital groove on the humerus and inserts on the superior margin of the glenoid cavity to press the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the rotator cuff and their respective muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) stabilize and fix the joint. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles aid in abduction and external rotation of the shoulder, while the subscapularis aids in internal rotation of the humerus.\n\n\nThe nerves supplying the shoulder joint all arise in the brachial plexus. They are the suprascapular nerve, the axillary nerve and the lateral pectoral nerve.\n\nThe shoulder joint is supplied with blood by branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries, the suprascapular artery and the scapular circumflex artery.\n\nThe rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder produce a high tensile force, and help to pull the head of the humerus into the glenoid cavity.\n\nThe glenoid cavity is shallow and contains the glenoid labrum which deepens it and aids in stability. With 120 degrees of unassisted flexion, the shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body.\nThe movement of the scapula across the rib cage in relation to the humerus is known as the \"scapulohumeral rhythm\", and this helps to achieve a further range of movement. This range can be compromised by anything that changes the position of the scapula. This could be an imbalance in parts of the large trapezius muscles that hold the scapula in place. Such an imbalance could cause a forward head carriage which in turn can affect the range of movements of the shoulder.\n\nExtension is carried out by the latissimus dorsi and posterior fibres of the deltoid.\nAdduction is carried out by the pectoralis major, lattisimus dorsi, teres major and the subscapularis.\nMedial rotation is carried out by the anterior fibres of the deltoid, teres major, subscapularis, pectoralis major and the lattissimus dorsi. \nLateral rotation is carried out by the posterior fibres of the deltoid, infraspinatus and the teres minor.\n\nThe capsule can become inflamed and stiff, with abnormal bands of tissue (adhesions) growing between the joint surfaces, causing pain and restricting movement of the shoulder, a condition known as frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis.\n\nA SLAP tear (superior labrum anterior to posterior) is a rupture in the glenoid labrum. SLAP tears are characterized by shoulder pain in specific positions, pain associated with overhead activities such as tennis or overhand throwing sports, and weakness of the shoulder. This type of injury often requires surgical repair.\n\nAnterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint occurs when the humeral head is displaced in the anterior direction. Anterior shoulder dislocation often is a result of a blow to the shoulder while the arm is in an abducted position. In younger people, these dislocation events are most commonly associated with fractures on the humerus and/or glenoid and can lead to recurrent instability. In older people, recurrent instability is rare but people often suffer rotator cuff tears. It is not uncommon for the arteries and nerves (axillary nerve) in the axillary region to be damaged as a result of a shoulder dislocation; which if left untreated can result in weakness, muscle atrophy, or paralysis.\n\nSubacromial bursitis is a painful condition caused by inflammation which often presents a set of symptoms known as subacromial impingement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2979142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2979142", "title": "Fruit snack", "text": "Fruit snack\n\nA fruit snack is a sugary processed food marketed to the parents as a snack for children in the United States. Fruit snacks are very similar to gummy candies. The main content is sugar, especially refined sugar derived from concentrated white grape juice and apple juice. Some fruit snacks have more sugar than gummi candies, and they usually have less protein. The main differences between gummi candies and fruit snacks are the marketing and advertising approaches, and the use of refined sugar extracted from tapioca or fruit juice in addition to, or sometimes instead of, refined sugar extracted from sugar beets, corn, or sugarcane.\n\nWell-known manufacturers of chewy fruit snacks include Promotion In Motion (Welch's brand), Kellogg's, General Mills and Betty Crocker. \n\nFruit snacks gained popularity from their convenience, candy-like taste, and marketing that positioned the product as being healthier than candy. Most are stored in disposable plastic packaging that does not need to be refrigerated; therefore, they can be taken virtually anywhere. However, they do have an expiration date. Fruit snacks vary in the amount of fruit content. Some, like Welch's, contain some fruit purees. Others only have trace amounts of juice, in addition to sugar. \n\nFruit leathers differ in that they have a different shape. The ingredients may be the same, or they may be made primarily from pureed, dried fruit and concentrated, high-sugar fruit juice.\n\nMore than half the weight of the fruit snacks is simple sugars. They also contain an average of 12% water by weight, 25% starch, a small amount of fat, and a negligible amount of protein. \n\nThe nutritional value or content of fruit snacks has long been contested. Much of the controversy surrounds the nutritional value (or possible lack thereof) in sugar, which is found in large amounts in some fruit snacks. Parents are advised to treat their children's consumption of fruit snacks the same way they would a candy or any other sugary snack food item.\n\nAs of 2015, fruit snacks generally cost two to five times the price of gummy bears.\n\nThe modern, highly processed fruit snack has nothing in common with dried fruit. The first modern fruit snack was Joray Fruit Rolls, which were developed by confectioner Louis Shalhoub in the 1970s. It was used by backpackers as a lightweight, high-energy food rather than as healthful-sounding candy for children. \n\nThe name \"fruit snack\" was first used in 1983 by General Mills, which they used to describe their version of Shalhoub's product, Fruit Roll-Ups, which contained far more sugar.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the fruit snack was a multimillion-dollar business. However, sales peaked in 2013 and declined over the next few years.\n\nIn some cases, manufactures of fruit snacks have faced class-action lawsuits over their marketing claims that fruit snacks are \"healthy.\"\n\n\nGeneral Mills, owner of Betty Crocker products, introduced the first Fruit Corners Fruit Roll-Ups in 1983 and then Fruit by the Foot. Fruit Roll-Ups and Fruit by the Foot are packaged similarly, and the products are rolled around a material so the snack does not stick to itself. However, the two snacks differ with respect to taste, texture, and consistency. \n\nFruit Gushers are fruit snacks in the shape of elongated hexagonal bipyramids, which made primarily from sugar and fruit juice, with small amounts of other ingredients. Introduced in 1991, they are produced by General Mills under the Betty Crocker brand name, and may be found in generic forms as well.\n\nAmong the many product types under the Welch's brand are Welch’s Fruit Snacks, which are manufactured and marketed under license by The Promotion In Motion Companies, Inc. Welch’s Fruit Snacks are made with fruit purees, corn syrup, sugar, starch, and juices, among other ingredients.\n\nKellogg's created \"Fruit Winders\" in the UK, which is similar to the American Fruit by the Foot by General Mills, only in fewer flavors. Unlike Fruit by the Foot, Fruit Winders contain no artificial colorings and each flavor is made with real purée derived from the fruit it represents (e.g. the strawberry flavour contains real strawberry purée).\n\nFruit Winders were introduced in the UK and Ireland in 2001 under the Kellogg's brand. The product was first called \"Real Fruit Winders\", which was later changed to \"Screamin Fruit Winders\" before being changed finally to \"Kellogg's Fruit Winders\". When the product first came out, the flavors were Orange, Strawberry and Blackcurrant, with Apple introduced shortly after. \n\nLater, a public call-in contest was held where people would vote for a new Fruit Winders flavor. The choices were Tropical, Raspberry and Lemon. The winning flavor was Tropical, but Raspberry and Lemon were introduced later on afterwards. In 2006, Fruit Winders discontinued the Orange, Tropical, Raspberry and Lemon flavors along with the spin-off products, and made the strands small enough ti fit two on each winder. Apple and Blackcurrant were placed into the Doubles, including brands with Strawberry, leaving Strawberry the only flavour to be sold as a single packets, but with two smaller winders. As of 2017, there had been a new flavor of Very Cherry added, and is sold only in select stores.\n\nThe spin-off products were a squeezable product called Screamin Fruit Squidgers and gummy candies with a liquid centre, which were called Screamin Fruit Spurters. These were discontinued in 2006. \n\nThe television adverts for Fruit Winders showed a fruit with eyes and a mouth being winded into a Fruit Winder by a character that was a humanoid version of the fruit it was harming, these ads often had the slogan \"Unwind the fruity fun, FOREVER!\". On the paper attached to the Fruit Winder, a comic strip is shown, it shows a comic of the characters winding the fruit. Every Winder has a different story or way of being winded.\n\nFruit Winder Gang\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks, owned by General Mills, uses sugar refined from sweet cassava roots.\n\nSunkist has manufactured and licensed several fruit snacks brands:\n"}
{"id": "2982651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2982651", "title": "Tri-tip", "text": "Tri-tip\n\nThe tri-tip is a triangular cut of beef from the bottom sirloin subprimal cut, consisting of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. Untrimmed, the tri-tip weighs around 5 pounds. \n\nThe cut existed as early as 1915, called \"the triangle part\" of the loin butt. Triangle tip, cooked in wine, was served at Jack's Corsican Room in Long Beach in 1955. The cut was marketed under the name \"tri tip\" as early as 1964, at Desert Provisions in Palm Springs.\n\nThe late Jack Ubaldi of Manhattan's Florence Prime Meat Market claims to first having got the bottom sirloins in the late 1940s and pulled out a muscle that he called the triangle. He started cutting what he dubbed Newport steaks from this piece because he said the shape was like the logo on a Newport cigarette ad he had seen.\n\nDonna Fong, a competition barbecue pitmaster, says that Otto Schaefer, Sr. discovered and marketed tri-tip in Oakland, California, in the 1950s. \n\nOtto decided to cook that triangular shaped steak which was located next to the ball tip. He cooked it whole and then sliced it thinly, instead of cutting a thick slice and cooking it like a traditional steak. The flavor was marvelous if you sliced it thin against the grain.\n\nThe discovery got Otto thinking that this cut of meat could be sold as a steak instead of being ground up into the less expensive hamburger. Otto started talking to their retail customers and marketed the steak as \"tri-tip\" because of its shape. \n\nLarry Viegas, a butcher at a Santa Maria Safeway store in the late 1950s, says that the idea to cook this as a distinct cut of beef first occurred to his store manager, Bob Schutz, when an excess of hamburger existed in the store (into which this part of the animal were usually ground). Viegas says that that day, Schultz took a piece of the unwanted meat, seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic salt, and placed it on a rotisserie for 45 minutes or an hour; the result was well-received, and Schultz began quietly marketing it as \"tri-tip\".\n\nIt became a local specialty in Santa Maria in the late 1950s. Today, it is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and other seasonings, grilled directly over red oak wood to medium-rare doneness. Alternative preparations include roasting whole on a rotisserie, smoking in a pit, baking in an oven, grilling, or braising in a Dutch oven after searing on a grill. After cooking, the meat is normally sliced across the grain before serving.\"\n\nSometimes labeled \"Santa Maria steak\", the roast is quite popular in the Central Valley regions and the Central Coast of California. It has begun to enjoy increasing favor elsewhere, as well, for its full flavor, lower fat content, and comparatively lower cost. Along with top sirloin, tri-tip is considered central to Santa Maria-style barbecue. In central California, the fat is left on the outside of the cut to enhance flavor when grilling, while butchers elsewhere trim the fat side for aesthetic purposes.\n\nTri-tip is called \"aiguillette baronne\" in France and is left whole as a roast. In northern Germany, it is called \"\" or \"Pastorenstück\", in Austria \"Hüferschwanz\", and in southern Germany it is called the same name as the traditional and popular Bavarian and Austrian dish \"Tafelspitz\", which serves it boiled with horseradish. In Spain, it is often grilled whole and called the \"rabillo de cadera\". \n\nIn Argentine \"asado\", it is known as \"colita de cuadril.\" In Brazilian \"churrasco\", it is known as \"maminha\".\n\nThis cut of beef can be sliced into steaks, grilled in its entirety, or used in chili con carne. To grill or roast the tri-tip, heat the pan on high until it is very hot. For best results, the tri-tip should be seared and roasted, putting the fat side down in the pan.

It is made of water, sugar and spirit vinegar with a selection of spices and colouring. It is suitable for vegans. \n\nHenry Henderson began manufacturing sauce in the latter part of the 19th century. Originally manufactured at 35 Broad Lane in Sheffield, Henderson’s Relish is still being made and was in uninterrupted production within half a mile of the site from which the first bottle was filled until the move to a new food production factory in 2013. The company was bought by Shaws of Huddersfield in 1910 who still supply Hendersons with vinegar. In 1940 Charles Hinksman formed the present company of Hendersons (Sheffield) Ltd., the control of which has remained with the family.\n\nIt is produced in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The product's slogan is, \"Made in Sheffield for over 100 years\".\n\nLike many similar sauces, Henderson's has a base of spirit vinegar, coloured with caramel and sweetened with sugar and (nowadays) saccharin. Its flavour is derived from tamarind, cayenne pepper and garlic oil. A spice that distinguishes Henderson's from other English sauces is its use of cloves.\n\nAccording to Hendersons, famous fans of the condiment include Sheffield-born celebrities Sean Bean, Def Leppard's Rick Savage and the late Peter Stringfellow. Politician David Blunkett, also a Sheffield native, used it when he cooked shepherd's pie on chef Gordon Ramsay's \"The F Word\" TV cookery programme.\n\nIn 1993, two special-edition labels were produced to celebrate the FA Cup semi-final. Sheffield's two league clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, both then in the Premier League, contested the match at Wembley. The bottles were produced with labels in both red and white stripes (United's colours) and blue and white stripes (Wednesday's colours). These labels are still available in the respective clubs' shops.\n\nThe singer/songwriter Richard Hawley used specially-labelled bottles of Henderson's Relish to promote his 2005 album 'Coles Corner', and on his 2007 autumn tour, special bottles of the relish were available to promote his then-current album Lady's Bridge. The bottles of relish cost £1.50, with fans purchasing them after the show, owing to glass bottles being banned from most auditoriums.\n\nThe comedian Tom Wrigglesworth said of Henderson's Relish that while outsiders think the condiment is Sheffield's answer to Worcestershire sauce, Sheffielders think it is the answer to \"everything\". \n\nHenderson's Relish has been an inspiration to several artists from Sheffield, such as Rick Savage (Def Leppard), who have produced pieces about the product. Pete McKee, Kid Acne and Jim Connolly have all released prints offering their own unique take on the relish. It also featured in the plotline of the second episode of Series 4 of BBC Radio 4's comedy series \"Tom Wrigglesworth's Hang-Ups\" in September 2016.\n\nA Sheffield-based women’s traditional rapper dance team, who perform a type of traditional northern sword dance with long Sheffield rapper knives, originally wanted to name themselves after Henderson’s Relish, but their approach to the company was rejected. Inspired by the condiment, they dance in costumes of black and orange, but adopted the name ‘Sheffield Steel Rapper’.\n\nA gold-label version was produced to commemorate Jessica Ennis winning the Heptathlon at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nIt can be found in local fish and chip shops and almost every supermarket and grocers in the city, yet is almost unavailable anywhere outside Yorkshire (although it can be ordered online).\n\nThe company has made little effort to market outside Yorkshire, instead preferring to encourage a loyal following nationally through this sense of exclusivity.\n\nKnowledge of Henderson's is so limited outside Yorkshire that Lewisham MP Jim Dowd misunderstood it as a copy of the anchovy-based Lea and Perrins and described it as \"parasitic packaging\" in an attempt to pass off one sauce as another, during a parliamentary debate on the Intellectual Property Bill. He had encountered the sauce at a pub in Blackheath, the Hare and Billet, also far outside the usual Henderson's region. Later, he was corrected by comments from Sheffield MPs Paul Blomfield and Nick Clegg. Dowd later toured the Henderson's factory in a peace-making gesture.\n\nAfter starting in Sheffield over one hundred years ago, until 2013 the relish was in uninterrupted production within half a mile of the original site on Broad Lane from which the first bottle was filled. The Henderson's factory was located opposite what was once Jessop's Hospital for Women, now part of the University of Sheffield. The building is adjacent to the University of Sheffield Supertram stop, on Leavygreave Road. In September 2008, the sign that had adorned the side of the historic Henderson's Relish building was stolen, and shortly afterwards was placed for sale on a local Sheffield blog.\n\nIn 2013, the manufacturer moved to J.F. Finnegan's 58 acre Sheffield Parkway Business Park.\n\nSheffield University plans to preserve and redevelop the original building as part of its campus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2993589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2993589", "title": "Rhinarium", "text": "Rhinarium\n\nThe rhinarium (New Latin, \"belonging to the nose\"; plural: rhinaria) is the furless skin surface surrounding the external openings of the nostrils in many mammals. Commonly it is referred to as the tip of the \"snout\", and breeders of cats and dogs sometimes use the term \"nose leather\". Informally, it may be called a \"wet snout\" or \"wet nose\", because its surface is moist in many species, e.g. healthy dogs and cats.\n\nIn many species the rhinarium has a mid-line groove (cleft) - the philtrum - and the surface is wrinkled (crenellated). Although the rhinarium is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is actually a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.. It also acts as a wind direction detector: the cold receptors in the skin of the rhinarium respond to the location where evaporation is the highest, which is determined by the wind direction.\n\nThe study of the structure of the rhinarium and of its associated functions has proved to be of considerable importance in mammalian evolution and taxonomy.\n\nIn an analogous connection of no relevance to vertebrate morphology, the term rhinarium sometimes is applied to chemosensory structures in invertebrates. For example, microscopic sensilla in the form of flattened sense organs on the antennae of aphids are referred to as rhinaria.\n\nMorphologically the rhinarium is part of the olfactory system, but it is open to debate which part of the system from which it is derived. It might be part of the main olfactory system, which captures media-borne odors; or it might be part of the \"second nose\", the accessory olfactory system, which samples chemicals dissolved in fluids. An example of the former view is that the rhinarium is \"an outward extension of the olfactory ... skin that covers the nasal passages, [which] contains nerve receptors for smell and touch.\" If that interpretation is correct, and the rhinarium extends the olfactory epithelium that lines the nasal passages, then the rhinarium is part of the main system.\n\nIn an opposing view, the philtrum ideally traces a path that continues over a notch in the upper lip, through a gap between the first incisors and premaxillae, along a \"midline palatal groove\" to \"a canal that connects with the duct of the vomeronasal organ,\" part of the accessory system. Where on the one hand the moisture (mucus) may have trapped odiferous molecules in the medium, on the other hand it may be the remnant of a fluid transmission system for molecules of pheromones.\n\nTypically the rhinarium is crenellated (wrinkled or embossed), which, as a generalisation has been speculated to increase its sensory area, but there are many exceptions and variations among different mammalian taxa, and also variations in its innervation and sensilla, so it is appropriate to treat generalisations with caution in this matter.\n\nMammals with rhinaria tend to have more acute sense of smell, and the loss of the rhinarium in the haplorrhine primates is related to their decreased reliance on olfaction, being associated with other derived characteristics such as a reduced number of turbinates.\nThe rhinarium is very useful to animals with good sense of smell because it acts as a wind direction detector. The cold receptors in the skin respond to the place where evaporation is the highest. Thus the detection of a particular smell is associated with the direction it came from.\n\nThe rhinarium is adapted for different purposes in different mammals according to ecological niche. In aquatic mammals, development of lobes next to the nostrils allow them to be closed for diving. In mammals that dig or root with their noses, the rhinarium often develops into a resilient pad, with the nostrils off to the side or below, and capable of closing for exclusion of dust. Examples include the common wombat, marsupial mole, and members of the Chrysochloridae. In the elephants it has become a tactile organ. In the walrus, it is covered with stiff bristles to protect it during foraging for shellfish. In many animals the form and purpose of the rhinarium remains to be elucidated.\n\nThe evolutionary pressures also are not always clearly distinguishable and there have been upheavals in late 20th and early 21st century taxonomy. For example, the lack of an obvious rhinarium in \"Tarsiiformes\" has been suggested to be the consequence of the enormous development of the eyeballs, rather than a loss of relevance of olfaction., but the significance is currently debatable, because there currently is an influential body of opinion favouring inclusion of the tarsiers in the Haplorhini rather than in the Strepsirrhini as had been traditional.\n\nThe rhinarium is a general mammalian feature and therefore is likely to have been present in the stem mammals. \n\nPrimates are phylogenetically divided into Strepsirrhini, and the Haplorhini. The Strepsirrhini, which means \"twisted-nosed\", are primates with rhinaria, which is the ancestral condition. The Strepsirrhini consists of the prosimians: the lorises, and the lemurs. The Haplorhini, which means \"simple-nosed\", are primates which have replaced the rhinarium with a more mobile, continuous, dry upper lip. The Haplorhini consists of the Simians: the monkeys, the apes, and humans.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, taxonomy ignored the fact that tarsiers have no rhinarium when placing them in the Strepsirrhini. However, since then the tarsiers have been placed in with the Haplorhini, and thus the absence of a rhinarium became diagnostic of the Haplorhini.\n\nIn an analogous connection of no relevance to vertebrate morphology, the term rhinarium sometimes is applied to chemosensory structures in invertebrates. For example, microscopic sensilla in the form of flattened sense organs on the antennae of aphids are referred to as rhinaria.\n\n"}

{"id": "2996111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2996111", "title": "Xiaolongbao", "text": "Xiaolongbao\n\nXiaolongbao is a type of Chinese steamed bun (\"baozi\") from the Jiangnan region, especially associated with Shanghai and Wuxi. It is traditionally prepared in Xi\"aolong\", which is a kind of small bamboo steaming basket, which give them their name. \"Xiaolongbao\" is often referred to as a kind of \"dumpling\", but should not be confused with British or American-style dumplings, nor with Chinese \"jiaozi\". \n\nThey are also called a \"soup dumpling\" because they are filled with hot soup and must be eaten carefully. In Shanghainese, they are also sometimes known as siaulon moedeu or \"xiaolong\"-style mantous as Wu Chinese speaking peoples use the traditional definition of \"mantou\" which refers to both filled and unfilled buns.\n\n\"Xiaolongbao\" originated in Changzhou, by Wan Hua Tea House, in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). \n\nShanghai-style \"xiaolongbao\" originated in Nanxiang, a suburb of Shanghai in Jiading District. The inventor of \"xiaolongbao\" sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the \"xiaolongbao\" expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. Wuxi style xiaolongbao is sweeter than Shanghai style.\n\nTwo specialist \"xiaolongbao\" restaurants have a particularly long history. One is \"Nanxiang Mantou Dian\" (Nanxiang Bun Shop), which derives from the original store in Nanxiang but is now located in the Yu Garden area. It is famed for its crab-meat-filled buns. The other is Gulong Restaurant, at the original site next to Guyi Garden in Nanxiang.\n\nChinese buns, in general, may be divided into two types, depending on the degree of leavening of the flour skin. Buns can be made with leavened or unleavened dough. Those made with unleavened dough use clear water for mixing, the skin is thin and the fillings large. It is frequently made in Nanxiang but is imitated elsewhere, calling it Xiang-style. Steamed buns made with raised flour are seen throughout China and are what is usually referred to as \"mantou\". Steamed xiaolongbao made with partially raised flour are more commonly seen in the south. This means that their skin is tender, smoother, and somewhat translucent, rather than being white and fluffy. As is traditional for buns of various sizes in the Jiangnan region, \"xiaolongbao\" is pinched at the top prior to steaming, so the skin has a circular cascade of ripples around the crown.\n\n\"Xiaolongbao\" is traditionally filled with pork. One popular and common variant is pork with minced crab meat and roe. More modern innovations include other meats, seafood, shrimp, crab meat, and vegetarian fillings. The characteristic soup-filled kind is created by wrapping solid meat aspic inside the skin alongside the meat filling. Heat from steaming then melts the gelatin-gelled aspic into soup. In modern times, refrigeration has made the process of making \"xiaolongbao\" during hot weather easier, since making gelled aspic is much more difficult at room temperature.\nTraditionally, \"xiaolongbao\" is a kind of \"dim sum\" (à la carte item) or \"\"xiaochi\"\" (snack). The buns are served hot in the bamboo baskets in which they were steamed, usually on a bed of dried leaves or paper mat, although some restaurants now use napa cabbage instead. The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with ginger slivers. They are traditionally served with a clear soup on the side. Around Shanghai, \"xiaolongbao\" may be eaten throughout the day, although usually not for breakfast. They form part of a traditional Jiangnan-style morning tea (). In Guangdong and the West, it is sometimes served as a dish during Cantonese tea time. Frozen \"xiaolongbao\" are now mass-produced and a popular frozen food sold worldwide.\n\nThe \"xiaolongbao\" is one of kind of \"tang bao\" (\"soup bun\") or \"guantang bao\" (\"soup-filled bun\"). Another form of \"tang bao\" with a differently-textured skin but about the same size is the \"xiaolong tangbao\", a specialty of Wuhan. Shengjianbao are very similar to xiaolongbao, but are pan fried instead of steamed.\n"}

Chai as a symbol goes back to medieval Spain. Letters as symbols in Jewish culture go back to the earliest Jewish roots, the Talmud states that the world was created from Hebrew letters which form verses of the Torah. In medieval Kabbalah, Chai is the lowest (closest to the physical plane) emanation of God. According to 16th century Greek rabbi Shlomo Hacohen Soloniki, in his commentary on the Zohar, Chai as a symbol has its linkage in the Kabbalah texts to God's attribute of 'Ratzon', or motivation, will, muse. The Jewish commentaries give an especially long treatment to certain verses in the Torah with the word as their central theme. Three examples are Leviticus 18:5 'Chai Bahem', 'and you shall live by [this faith]' (as opposed to just doing it), this is part of the section dealing with the legacy of Moses Our Teacher following his death. Deuteronomy 30:15 \"Verily, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, in that I command thee this day to love the thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live.\" There is nary an ancient Jewish commentator who does not comment on that verse. The Shema prayer as well speaks of the importance of Chai, to live and walk in the Jewish cultural lifestyle.\n\nTwo common Jewish names used since Talmudic times, are based on this symbol, Chaya feminine, Chayim masculine. The Jewish toast (on alcoholic beverages such as wine) is l'chaim, 'to life'.\n\nThe word is made up of two letters of the Hebrew alphabet - Chet () and Yod (), forming the word \"chai\", meaning \"alive\", or \"living\". The most common spelling in Latin script is \"Chai\", but the word is occasionally also spelled \"Hai\". The usual modern pronunciation of this word is , while a transcription of the Biblical and Mishnaic pronunciation would have likely been (with a pharyngeal consonant).\n\nIn Hebrew, the related word \"chaya\" () means \"living thing\" or \"animal\", and is derived from the Hebrew word \"chai\" (), meaning \"life\".\n\nThere have been various mystical numerological speculations about the fact that, according to the system of gematria, the letters of \"chai\" add up to 18 (see \"Lamedvavniks\" etc.). For this reason, 18 is a spiritual number in Judaism, and many Jews give gifts of money in multiples of 18 as a result.\n\nThe Chai symbol can be worn by Jews as a medallion around the neck, similarly to other Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David and the Hamsa.\n\nJews often give gifts and donations in multiples of 18, which is called \"giving chai\". Mailings from Jewish charities usually suggest the amounts to give in multiples of chai (18, 36, 54 dollars, etc.) rather than the usual multiples of 25.\n\nIt appears in the slogan \"\"!\"\" (, \"The people of Israel lives!\").\n\nIt is heard in a BBC recording from April 20, 1945 of Jewish survivors of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp five days after their liberation. This was the first Sabbath ceremony openly conducted on German soil since the beginning of the war. With people still dying around them, the survivors sang what would become the Israeli national anthem, \"Hatikvah\". At the end of \"Hatikvah\", British Army Chaplain Leslie Hardman shouts out, \"Am Yisrael Chai!\" (\"The people of Israel is alive!\")\n\nIn the Eurovision Song Contest 1983, which was held in Germany four decades after Shoah, Israel was represented with the song \"Chai\", performed by Ofra Haza, which includes the line \"Am Yisra'el chai\".\n\nSeveral Jewish radio stations have the word in their names, including Kol Chai (Israel), Radio Jai (Argentina), and ChaiFM (South Africa).\n\nElvis Presley wore a Chai necklace while performing toward the end of his life. Baseball star Rod Carew wore a chai necklace during his playing days; his first wife and daughters were Jewish, even though Carew himself never formally converted to Judaism. Canadian rapper Drake, himself Jewish, wore a Chai necklace on the cover of \"Vibe\" magazine in 2010.\n\n"}

{"id": "3007244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3007244", "title": "Aufheben", "text": "Aufheben\n\nAufheben or Aufhebung is a German word with several seemingly contradictory meanings, including \"to lift up\", \"to abolish\", \"cancel\" or \"suspend\", or \"to sublate\". The term has also been defined as \"abolish\", \"preserve\", and \"transcend\". In philosophy, \"aufheben\" is used by Hegel to explain what happens when a thesis and antithesis interact, and in this sense is translated mainly as \"sublate\".\n\nIn Hegel, the term \"Aufhebung\" has the apparently contradictory implications of both preserving and changing, and eventually advancement (the German verb \"aufheben\" means \"to cancel\", \"to keep\" and \"to pick up\"). The tension between these senses suits what Hegel is trying to talk about. In sublation, a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept. Sublation is the motor by which the dialectic functions.\n\nSublation can be seen at work at the most basic level of Hegel's system of logic. The two concepts \"Being\" and \"Nothing\" are each both preserved and changed through sublation in the concept \"Becoming\". Similarly, \"determinateness\", or \"quality\", and \"magnitude\", or \"quantity\", are each both preserved and sublated in the concept \"measure\".\n\nHegel's philosophy of history stresses the importance of negative (the antithesis) in history—negative includes wars, etc., but not only. His conception of historical progress follows a dialectic spiral, in which the thesis is opposed by the antithesis, itself sublated by the synthesis. Hegel stated that Aufheben is uniquely exempt from the historical process in that it is supposed to be true for all time and never changes or develops further as in \"das absolute Wissen\" (\"absolute knowledge\"). The synthesis both abolishes and preserves the thesis and the antithesis, an apparent contradiction which leads to difficulties in interpreting this concept (and to translate \"Aufheben\"). In Hegel's logic, self-contradiction is legitimate and necessary.\n\nFor Hegel, history (like logic) proceeds in every small way through sublation. For example, the Oriental, Greek and Roman Empires (in which the individual is ignored or annihilated, then recognized, and finally suppressed by the States) are preserved \"and\" destroyed in the First French Empire, which, for Hegel, placed the individual in harmony with the State.\n\nAt the level of social history, sublation can be seen at work in the master-slave dialectic.\n\nHegel approached the history of philosophy in the same way, arguing that important philosophical ideas of the past are not rejected but rather preserved and changed as philosophy develops.\n\nIn Hegel's view, one can always find another thing in reflective philosophy upon which some \"absolute\" ground relies. With Fichte's ultimate ground, the \"I\" or \"ego\", for example, one can immediately see the reliance upon the \"non-I\", which allows Fichte to distinguish what he means by the \"I\". Reflection is circular, as Fichte unapologetically acknowledged.\n\nFor Hegel, reflective thought is to be avoided due to its circularity. It leads to covering the same problems and ground ever and anon for each philosophical generation. It is a \"philosophia perennis.\"\n\nInstead, Hegel calls on speculative thought: two contradictory elements are held together, uplifted and sublated without completely destroying one another. Speculative thought seeks to avoid the idealism inherent in reflective thought and allows one to think in concrete terms about how things work, both in the present, real world and in history.\n\nMarx identifies sublation as the manner in which material, historical conditions develop. This is in stark contrast to the philosophical idealism of Hegel, for whom sublation reflects the agency of a specific \"Geist\" – a concept that has often been translated as \"mind\" or \"spirit\".\n\n\n"}

A genetic test, developed by the a2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the company to certify milk producers as producing milk that does not metabolise to β-casomorphin 7.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the scientific literature and published their results in 2009. As part of their evaluation, the EFSA looked at the laboratory studies that had been done on BCM-7 that found that BCM-7 can act as a weak opioid receptor agonist. The EFSA found no relationship between any disease and drinking milk with the A1 protein. In most of the animal studies, BCM-7 was not administered orally, as humans would be exposed to it, but rather was given to animals by injection into the peritoneal cavity or directly into the spinal cord or brain, which makes these studies not useful for understanding how BCM-7 might affect humans. The EFSA study emphasized the dangers of drawing conclusions from correlations identified in epidemiological studies and the dangers of not reviewing all the evidence at hand. Another 2009 review found no demonstration that consuming milk with A1 casein causes diabetes. A 2014 review of research into the relationship between consumption of dairy products (including A1 and A2 proteins) and the incidence of diabetes found that while there appears to be a positive correlation between consumption of dairy products by babies and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), and an inverse relationship between the consumption of dairy products and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), these correlations are tentative; it is impossible to determine which component or components of milk might be responsible for these effects, and it is unlikely that the expensive and complex research to determine the answers to these questions will ever be conducted.\n\nMilk with predominantly A2 protein is not a milk substitute for infants with cow milk protein allergies.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company claims that people who experience discomfort drinking ordinary cows' milk may experience relief when they switch to milk with predominantly A2 protein. This claim is not supported by research.\n\nIn the 1980s, some medical researchers began to explore whether some peptides (including peptides from casein) that are created during digestion might have negative or positive health effects.\n\nInterest in the distinction between A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins began in the early 1990s via epidemiological research and animal studies initially conducted by scientists in New Zealand, which found correlations between the prevalence of milk with A1 beta-casein proteins in some countries and the prevalence of various chronic diseases. The research generated interest in the media, as well as among the scientific community and entrepreneurs. If it were indeed true that BCM-7 is harming humans, this would be an important public health issue, as well as a commercial opportunity.\n\nCow milk is about 87 percent water and 13 percent solids, a combination of fat, carbohydrates in the form of lactose, minerals, and protein. The major component of the milk proteins is About 30 to 35 percent of the casein (equivalent to two teaspoons per quart of milk) is beta-casein, of which there are several varieties, determined by the genes of the cow. The most common of these variants are A1 and A2 proteins (named for the order in which they were identified by scientists), with the sole difference is that one of the 209 amino acids that make up the beta-casein proteins: a proline occurs at position 67 in the chain of amino acids that make up the A2 beta-casein, while in A1 beta-casein a histidine occurs at that position. Studies in cells found that digestive enzymes that cut up proteins interact with beta-casein precisely at that location, so that A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins are processed differently. A seven-amino acid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7, (BCM-7) can be cut away from the A1-beta-casein protein by those enzymes, but the enzymes cannot cut the A2 protein at that location, so BCM-7 is not formed from A2 proteins. Studies in humans have not consistently found that BCM-7 is formed in the human digestive system. BCM-7 can also be created during the fermentation of milk or through the process by which cheese is made; those same processes can also destroy BCM-7.\n\nScientists believe the difference originated as a mutation that occurred between 5000 and 10,000 years ago—as cattle were being taken north into Europe—when the proline at position 67 was replaced by histidine, with the mutation subsequently spreading widely throughout herds in the Western world through breeding.\n\nThe percentage of the A1 and A2 beta-casein protein varies between herds of cattle, and also between countries and provinces. While African and Asian cattle continue to produce only A2 beta-casein, the A1 version of the protein is common among cattle in the western world. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the USA, Australia and New Zealand. On average, more than 70 percent of Guernsey cows produce milk with predominantly A2 protein, while among Holsteins and Ayrshires between 46 and 70 percent produce milk containing both the A1 and A2 proteins.\n\nThe A2 Corporation was founded in New Zealand in 2000 to commercialise a genetic test to determine whether a cow will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market the milk it produces as A2 or A2 MILK. In 2003, A2's website said: \"Beta casein A1 may be a primary risk factor for heart disease in adult men, and also be involved in the progression of insulin-dependent diabetes in children\" and the CEO had linked A1 to schizophrenia and autism. A2 Corporation also petitioned the Food Standards Australia New Zealand regulatory authority to require a health warning on ordinary milk.\n\nThe company initially marketed its milk as containing no A1 protein, but in 2003 the New Zealand Commerce Commission tested the milk and found some A1 protein in it, and forbade the company from saying the milk had no A1 protein; the commission notice of the ruling said: \"Although the A2 Corporation expressed confidence during the investigation that its quality controls were sufficient to exclude the vast majority of beta casein A1, it acknowledged that it could not be certain that there was no A1 in A2 milk.\"\n\nA2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited in April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.\n\n\"A2\" and \"A2 MILK\" are trademarks held by the A2 Milk Company.\n\nA2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on genetic tests to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning supposed adverse health consequences of milk containing both the A1 and A2 proteins.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company focused its initial efforts on urging farmers to undertake breeding programs to develop herds that would produce milk with predominantly A2 protein. However the launch of the milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had contracts with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms. These contracts were protected under New Zealand law by the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act of 2001. Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights, Howard Paterson, the CEO of A2 Corporation, led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks. The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports. The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand to issue reports and statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.\n\nA2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch its milk in New Zealand at the end of April 2003. In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died. In July, Paterson was found dead in his hotel room during a business trip at the age of 50, and a month later Dr Corran McLachlan died of cancer at the age of 59. In New Zealand it is illegal to make health claims about a food product without providing scientific evidence and registering the food as a medicine, and in November 2003 the New Zealand Commerce Commission advised that A2 Corporation Ltd and its licensed a2 MILK brand producers had agreed to amend the health claims in their promotional material following a warning from the commission. By end of 2003 the weakened A2 Corporation had withdrawn the litigation against Fonterra and negotiations had resumed.\n\nMeanwhile, milk with predominantly A2 protein was first marketed anywhere in the world in March 2003 in Australia by a dairy farm unaffiliated with A2 Corporation run by the Denniston family. Shortly thereafter, an Australian company called A2 Dairy Marketers licensed patent rights and the A2 trademark from A2 Corporation and started offering Australian dairy farmers a premium price for their milk, if it was shown to be pure A1 protein-free milk. The Dennistons and A2 Dairy Marketers marketed milk with predominantly A2 protein boldly, touting its safety and the dangers of standard milk. However, Australian laws forbid companies from making misleading health claims about food, and in September 2004, A2 Dairy Marketers in Australia was fined $15,000 after it pleaded guilty to six breaches of those laws. The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into administration in October and was liquidated in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars. A$1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled. A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A1 protein-free herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.\n\nIn December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to Fraser & Neave, a food marketing giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million. A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser & Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses. A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.\n\nAs A2 Corporation grew its business, opposition to A2 Corporation's claims played out in the media. Dairy Australia, the national association of the Australian dairy industry, and market competitors like Parmalat have consistently said that there is no evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.\n\nIn 2006, A2 Corporation was on sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser & Neave. In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled. In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.\n\nPublication of a book, \"Devil in the Milk\" by Keith Woodford, about A1 beta-casein and its perceived dangers to health, boosted sales of milk with predominantly A2 protein in Australia and New Zealand and prompted the New Zealand Food Safety Authority to propose again reviewing the science to address consumer concerns that A1 milk might be harmful. It asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to undertake such a review. The EFSA report, released in 2009, found that \"a cause and effect relationship is not established between the dietary intake of BCM7 (beta-casomorphin-7), related peptides or their possible protein precursors and non-communicable diseases\".\n\nCommercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of milk with predominantly A2 protein were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and yoghurt made with milk with predominantly A2 protein went on the market in Australia in April 2010.\n\nIn February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents/share. In December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board, and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses under the a2 and a2 MILK brands. It listed in March 2013.\n\nA2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited in April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.\n\nOther products produced using milk with predominantly A2 protein were developed including thickened cream, infant formula, ice cream, yogurts and other dairy products.\n\nIn 2014 Lion, a beverage and food company that operates in Australia and New Zealand and is owned by Kirin, relaunched their \"Pura\" milk product with a new label stating: \"Naturally contains A2 protein.\"\n\nThe a2 Milk Company announced in November 2014 that it had begun the application process for a dual listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in a bid to open its register to Australian investors and boost the liquidity of its shares. The company said it expected a listing to be completed by March 2015.\n\nIn August 2003, as part of a new focus on overseas markets following the death of its founders, A2 Corporation exclusively licensed patent and trademark rights to US-based Ideasphere Incorporated (ISI) to market milk with predominantly A2 protein products in North America under its a2 and a2 MILK brands. ISI had paid A2 $500,000 in license fees by the end of 2004. ISI acquired Twinlab in September 2003, followed by another string of acquisitions in the dietary supplement market. In June 2005, ISI and A2 Corporation agreed to form a joint venture, A2 Milk Company LLC; A2 Corporation invested $400,000 and ISI assigned the license agreement to the new company.\n\nIn April 2007 A2 Corporation announced a deal in which the joint venture would license rights to the Original Foods Company, whose branding the milk with predominantly A2 protein product would carry, and in which the product would be sold in several midwestern states through the Hy-Vee supermarket chain under the a2 and a2 MILK brands.\n\nIn A2 Corporation's 2009 Annual Report, the company announced that the joint venture had regained all rights to the US market through a settlement with the Original Foods Company, and that \"The US dairy milk market remains intensely competitive and continues to be a major challenge.\" In 2010 A2 Corporation bought out all but less than 1% of ISI's share in the joint venture.\n\nA2 Corporation formed a joint venture with a major British milk supplier, Müller Wiseman Dairies, in November 2011 to process, market and sell its milk with predominantly A2 protein products in Britain and Ireland. In June 2014, the a2 Milk Company reported it had 20 dedicated farms supplying milk for processing in the UK. In its first year the milk recorded ₤1 million in sales through 1000 stores. On 1 January 2014, the a2 Milk Company exited its joint venture with Müller Wiseman Dairies by acquiring MWD's stake for a \"nominal\" amount.\n\nThe first consignments of the a2 Milk Company's infant formulas were sent to China in 2013. Shipments were interrupted for two months starting in April 2014 when the Chinese government introduced strict new import regulations for infant formula in response to the 2008 Chinese milk scandal in which more than 300,000 infants were poisoned by contaminated milk formula.\n\nIn 2018, the a2 Milk Company was fined 100,100 yuan for breaching Chinese child image advertising rules over using An Ji, son of Hu Ke and Sha Yi, in their advertising when he was under 10.\n\nThe Brasilian Association of Allergy and Immunology found that 350,000 individuals are allergic to beta-caseins. As of 2017, about 700 liters of milk a day were produced in the country through Gir cows that are also exported to India. Gir cows are procured from India.\n"}

Frangipane is one of France's many traditional foods associated with Christmas celebration.\n\nToday it is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds.\n\nIn some anecdotes it was the kind of sweet that the noblewoman Jacopa da Settesoli brought to St. Francis of Assisi in 1226, when he was dying.\n\nOn Epiphany, the French cut the King Cake, a round cake made of frangipane layers into slices to be distributed by a child known as le petit roi (the little king) who is usually hiding under the dining table. The cake is decorated with stars, a crown, flowers and a special bean hidden inside the cake. Whoever gets the piece of the frangipane cake with the bean is crowned “king” or “queen” for the following year.\n\nThe word comes ultimately from French, named after Marquis Muzio Frangipani.

Food critic Simon Hopkinson claimed that Coulson told him he got the recipe from a Patricia Martin of Claughton in Lancashire. Martin had published the recipe in a compilation that later became \"The Good Food Guide Dinner Party Book\", and first served the dish at her country hotel. Coulson's recipe only differs from Martin's in the sauce. Her son later told Hopkinson that she had originally got the recipe from two Canadian air force officers who had lodged at her hotel during the Second World War.

In general usage, it is used, with proper form, after a person's name, and means \"teacher\"; the word is also used as a title to refer to or address other professionals or persons of authority, such as clergy, accountants, lawyers, physicians, and politicians or to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, e.g., accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists.\n\nThe two characters that make up the term can be directly translated as \"born before\" and imply one who teaches based on wisdom from age and experience.\n\nThe word prefaced by the adjective 大, pronounced \"dai\" (or \"ō\"), which means \"great\" or \"large\", is often translated \"grand master\". This compound term, \"dai-sensei\", is sometimes used to refer to the top sensei in a particular school or tradition, particularly within the iemoto system. For a more senior member of a group who has not achieved the level of sensei, the term is used – note the common use of 先 \"before\"; in martial arts, this is particularly used for the most senior non-sensei member.\n\nThe Japanese expression of 'sensei' shares the same characters as the Chinese word 先生, pronounced \"xiānshēng\" in Standard Chinese. Xiansheng was a courtesy title for a man of respected stature. Middle Chinese pronunciation of this term may have been * or *. In modern Standard Chinese, it is used in the same way as the title \"Mr\". Prior to the development of the modern vernacular, \"xiānshēng\" was used to address teachers of both genders; this has fallen out of usage in Standard Chinese, though it is retained in some southern Chinese Chinese varieties such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew and Hakka, where it still has the meaning \"teacher\" or \"doctor\". In Japanese, \"sensei\" is still used to address people of both genders. It is likely both the current Southern Chinese and Japanese usages are more reflective of its Middle Chinese etymology.\n\nIn Sanbo Kyodan related zen schools, \"sensei\" is used to refer to ordained teachers below the rank of rōshi. However, other schools of Buddhism in Japan use the term for any priest regardless of seniority; for example, this title is also used for Jōdo Shinshū ministers in the United States, whether they are ethnic Japanese or not. In the Kwan Um School of Zen, according to Zen master Seungsahn, the Korean title \"ji do poep sa nim\" is much like the Japanese title \"sensei\".\n\nIn Nichiren Buddhism, members of the Soka Gakkai International refer to the president of the sangha, currently Daisaku Ikeda, as Sensei.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3013504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3013504", "title": "Irregardless", "text": "Irregardless\n\nIrregardless is a word sometimes used in place of \"regardless\" or \"irrespective,\" which has caused controversy since the early twentieth century, though the word appeared in print as early as 1795. Most dictionaries list it as non-standard or incorrect usage, and recommend that \"regardless\" should be used instead.\n\nThe origin of \"irregardless\" is not known for certain, but the speculation among dictionary references suggests that it is probably a blend, or portmanteau word, of the standard English words \"irrespective\" and \"regardless\". The blend creates a word with a meaning not predictable from the meanings of its constituent morphemes. Since the prefix \"ir\"- means \"not\" (as it does with \"irrespective\"), and the suffix -\"less\" means \"without\", the word contains a double negative. The word \"irregardless\" could therefore be expected to have the meaning \"in regard to\", therefore being an antonym, rather than a synonym, of regardless.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), \"irregardless\" was first acknowledged in 1912 by the \"Wentworth American Dialect Dictionary\" as originating from western Indiana, though the word was in use in South Carolina before Indiana became a territory. The usage dispute over \"irregardless\" was such that, in 1923, \"Literary Digest\" published an article titled \"Is There Such a Word as Irregardless in the English Language?\" The \"OED\" goes on to explain the word is primarily a North American colloquialism.\n\nOne way to follow the progress of and sentiments toward \"irregardless\" is by studying how it is described in references throughout the twentieth century. \"Webster's New International Dictionary\" (2nd. Ed. Unabridged, 1934) described the word as an erroneous or humorous form of \"regardless,\" and attributed it to the United States. Although \"irregardless\" was beginning to make its way into the American lexicon, it was still not universally recognized and was missing completely from \"Fowler's Modern English Usage,\" published in 1965, nor was \"irregardless\" mentioned under the entry for \"regardless\". In the last twenty-five years, \"irregardless\" has become a common entry in dictionaries and usage reference books, although commonly marked as substandard or dialect. It appears in a wide range of dictionaries including \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged\" (1961, repr. 2002), \"The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology\" (1988), \"The American Heritage Dictionary\" (Second College Edition, 1991), \"Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary\" (2001), and \"Webster's New World College Dictionary\" (Fourth Edition, 2004). The definition in most dictionaries is simply listed as \"regardless\" (along with the note \"nonstandard\", or similar). \"Merriam–Webster\" even states, \"Use \"regardless\" instead.\" \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" calls \"irregardless\" \"[a]n error\" and instructs writers to \"[u]se \"regardless\" (or possibly \"irrespective\").\"\n\nAustralian linguist Pam Peters (\"The Cambridge Guide to English Usage\", 2004) suggests that \"irregardless\" has become fetishized because natural examples of this word in corpora of written and spoken English are greatly outnumbered by examples where it is in fact only cited as an incorrect term.\n\nThe approach taken by lexicographers when documenting a word's uses and limitations can be prescriptive or descriptive. The method used with \"irregardless\" is overwhelmingly prescriptive. Much of the criticism comes from the double negative pairing of the prefix (\"ir-\") and suffix (-\"less\"), which stands in contrast to the negative polarity exhibited by most standard varieties of English. Critics also use the argument that \"irregardless\" is not – or should not be – a word at all, because it lacks the antecedents of a \"bona fide nonstandard word.\" A counterexample is provided in \"ain't\", which has an \"ancient genealogy\" at which scholars have not leveled such criticisms.\n"}

The dough used is either Italian bread dough or pizza dough.\n\nStromboli was likely invented by Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants in the United States in Philadelphia, though it may have similar counterparts originating in Italy. It is believed to be named after the Italian film \"Stromboli\" or the island of Stromboli.\n\nA stromboli is somewhat similar to a calzone. A calzone is a baked turnover stuffed with pizza ingredients. A stromboli is usually made by rolling up dough with cheese and meat ingredients and is then baked, but it does not generally contain pizza ingredients aside from cheese and Italian meats. Generally, strombolis do not usually contain tomato sauce, unlike calzones. A calzone is crescent-shaped, and a stromboli is usually shaped like a long cylinder. The distinction between the two is complicated because there is some variation in what constitutes a stromboli.\n\nMany American pizza shops serve a stromboli using pizza dough that is folded in half with fillings, similar to a half-moon-shaped calzone. At other establishments, a stromboli is made with a square-shaped pizza dough that can be topped with any pizza toppings and is then rolled into a cylindrical jelly roll shape and baked. Other variations include adding pizza sauce or deep-frying, similar to \"panzerotti\".\n\nThere are several claims regarding the origin of the usage of the name \"stromboli\" for food in the United States.\n\nRomano's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria claims to have first used the name in 1950 in Essington, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, courtesy of Nazzareno Romano. The pizzeria owner had experimented with \"pizza imbottito\", or \"stuffed pizza\", and added ham, cotechino salame, cheese and peppers into a pocket of bread dough. His future brother-in-law suggested he name it after the recently released movie \"Stromboli\", notorious for an off-screen affair between married actress, Ingrid Bergman, and married director, Roberto Rossellini, resulting in a love child.\n\nIn 1954, Mike Aquino of Mike's Burger Royal in Spokane, Washington, says he also named a turnover after the same movie. However, Aquino's version appears to only share the same name as the commonly accepted version of the stromboli and is significantly different from the Philadelphia turnover version that is usually defined as a \"stromboli\". Aquino's \"stromboli\" is a consisting of capicola ham and provolone cheese covered in an Italian chili sauce on a French bread roll.\n\n\n"}
