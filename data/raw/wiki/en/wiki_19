{"id": "7748571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7748571", "title": "Lokma", "text": "Lokma\n\nLokma (Turkish), Loqma (Arabic: لقمة, plural لقيمات, \"Luqaimat\", عوامة,\" 'Awama\"), Loukoumades (, singular λουκουμάς, \"loukoumas\"), or Bāmiyeh (Persian: بامیه) are pastries made of leavened and deep fried dough, soaked in syrup or honey, sometimes coated with cinnamon or other ingredients. The dish was described as early as the 13th century by al-Baghdadi as \"luqmat al-qādi\" (), \"judge's morsels\".\n\n\"Lokma\" means \"mouthful\" or \"morsel\", from Arabic \"luqma\" (plural \"luqmāt\").\n\nThe recipe for \"Luqmat al-Qadi\", yeast-leavened dough boiled in oil and doused in honey or sugar syrup with rosewater, dates back to at least the early medieval period and the 13th-century Abbasid Caliphate, where it is mentioned in several of the existent cookery books of the time. It is also mentioned in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", in the story \"The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad\". Today, in Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, \"luqaymat\", sometimes spiced with cardomom or saffron, are little changed. In the Levant, they are called awameh (عوامة) or zalabieh (زلابية).\n\nThe explorer and scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century encountered the dish he knew as \"Luqaymat al-Qadi\" at a dinner in Multan, then part of India, where his hosts called it \"al-Hashimi\".\n\nBoortsog, called \"pişi\" or \"tuzlu lokma\" (salty lokma) in Turkish, which is Lokma without any sweet syrup or honey, is a staple food for Turkic and Mongolian cuisines. Lokma in the form of a dessert is made with flour, sugar, yeast and salt, fried in oil and later bathed in syrup or honey. Lokma is first described as part of Turkish cuisine in the 9th century Kara-Khanid Khanate. It was cooked by palace cooks in the Ottoman Empire for centuries and spread to the cuisines of the former countries of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, Middle East and the Caucasus. While in the former Ottoman countries such as Iraq and Greece it is an ordinary dessert, it has a ceremonial meaning in Turkey and is generally not consumed as an everyday dessert. Traditionally, forty days after someone passes away, close relatives and friends of the deceased cook Lokma in large quantities and serve to neighbours and passersby. People form queues to get a plate and recite a prayer for the soul of the deceased in return after eating the Lokma.\n\nLokma in Greece and Cyprus, called Loukoumades, are commonly spiced with cinnamon in a honey syrup and can be sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar. The exact recipe for Lokma has evolved over many centuries; however, it is a traditional Greek dessert with roots in deep antiquity, a number of ancient honey-cakes are described above which most likely constitute the origin of Lokma, whose present name is borrowed from Turkish. The ancient recipes were inherited via the Byzantine empire and passed on to the occupied countries of the Ottoman Empire, corresponding to where Lokma are found today. The candidate most frequently mentioned as being prepared with hot oil is enkrides, which is described above along with other postulated ancestral honey-cakes. Lokum is called \"sfingi\" (σφίνγοι) by the Greek Jews, who make them as Hanukkah treats. The tradition is claimed to have been originated by the Romaniotes.\n\nVarious other kinds of fried dough with syrup are found in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and South Asia, from the Italian \"struffoli\" (the most similar in preparation to \"lokma\") and \"zeppole\" to the Indian \"jalebi\" and \"gulab jamun\".\n\nPerhaps the oldest documentation of a related but not identical dish is in the tomb of Ramses IV, where something more like jalebi is shown being prepared. Later, the Ancient Greek \"enchytoi\" consisted of a cheese-and-flour dough squeezed into hot fat, then covered with honey.\n\nA dish very similar to \"lokma\" is described by Archestratus, a Greek poet from Sicily, was \"enkris\" (, plural ἐγκρίδες)—a dough-ball fried in olive oil, which he details in his \"Gastronomy\"; a work now lost, but partially preserved in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, which mentions \"enkris\" thirteen times, in various inflected forms. The most complete description of it in the \"Deipnosophists\" is a passage that reads:\n\nIt is also mentioned in preserved fragments of Aristophanes's \"Danaids\" and Pherecrates's \"Crapataloi\", Stesichorus, and Antiphon\n\nThis word is also used in the Greek Septuagint to describe the manna eaten by the Israelites in the Book of Exodus\n\nAnd also in the Book of Numbers, \n\nAlso, there may be a connection to the ritual feeding of the victors at ancient Olympia. Aristotle and other ancient writers refer to \"kharisioi plakoi\" or \"plakonta\" (χαρίσιοι πλάκοι, πλακούντα), translated as \"(thanksgiving) cakes or \"(gift) cakes\". These were offered to the victorious athletes in a highly ritualized ceremony along with the kotinos wreath. No recipe survives.\n\nA fragment from Callimachus has been used to argue the supposed antiquity of \"lokum\" and a connection to the ancient Olympics by, among others, \"The Washington Post\". Various assertions have also been made regarding \"ompne\" () in the text means, in the plural form, \"sacrificial cakes made of grain and honey\". Other sacrificial cakes, often called \"popanon\" () being ancestral to \"loukoumades\"; however, the only thing that is clear about them is that they were made from grain and honey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7757190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7757190", "title": "Food waste", "text": "Food waste\n\nFood waste or food loss is food that is discarded or lost uneaten. The causes of food waste or loss are numerous and occur at the stages of producing, processing, retailing and consuming.\n\nGlobal food loss and waste amount to between one-third and one-half of all food produced. Loss and wastage occur at all stages of the food supply chain or value chain. In low-income countries, most loss occurs during production, while in developed countries much food – about per person per year – is wasted at the consumption stage.\n\nA lot of the time, food loss or food waste is food that is lost during any of the four stages of the food supply chain: (1) producers, (2) processors, (3) retailers, and (4) consumers. Precise definitions are contentious, often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of waste). Professional bodies, including international organizations, state governments and secretariats may use their own definitions.\n\nAmong other things, in what food waste consists of, how it is produced, and where or what it is discarded from or generated by. Definitions also vary because certain groups do not consider (or have traditionally not considered) food waste to be a waste material, due to its applications. Some definitions of what food waste consists of are based on other waste definitions (e.g. agricultural waste) and which materials do not meet their definitions.\n\nLost food may go to landfills, be put back into the food supply chain, or be put to other nonfood productive uses.\n\nUnder the UN's Save Food initiative, the FAO, UNEP, and stakeholders have agreed on the following definition of food loss and waste:\n\n\nImportant components of this definition include:\n\nIn the European Union, food waste was defined as \"any food substance, raw or cooked, which is discarded, or intended or required to be discarded\" since 1975 until 2000 when the old directive was repealed by Directive 2008/98/EC, which has no specific definition of food waste. The directive, 75/442/EEC, containing this definition was amended in 1991 (91/156) with the addition of \"categories of waste\" (Annex I) and the omission of any reference to national law.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency defines food waste for the United States as \"uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and commercial establishments such as grocery stores, restaurants, and produce stands, institutional cafeterias and kitchens, and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms\". The states remain free to define food waste differently for their purposes, though many choose not to. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Americans throw away up to 40% of food that is safe to eat.\nThe definitions by the UN and EU have come under criticism for including food that goes to nonfood productive use in their definitions of food waste. According to the authors of one study, this is flawed for two reasons: \"First, if recovered food is used as an input, such as animal feed, fertilizer, or biomass to produce output, then by definition it is not wasted. However, there might be economic losses if the cost of recovered food is higher than the average cost of inputs in the alternative, nonfood use. Second, the definition creates practical problems for measuring food waste because the measurement requires tracking food loss in every stage of the supply chain and its proportion that flows to nonfood uses.\" The authors of the study argue that only food that ends up in landfills should be counted as food waste.\n\nIn the US, food waste can occur at most stages of the food industry and in significant amounts. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food waste are unknown, but are likely to be insignificant by comparison, due to the limited stages at which waste can occur, and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand. Nevertheless, on-farm losses in storage in developing countries, particularly in African countries, can be high although the exact nature of such losses is much debated.\n\nIn the food industry of the United States, the food supply of which is the most diverse and abundant of any country in the world, waste occurs from the beginning of food production chain. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and severe weather, which cause losses before harvest. Since natural forces (e.g. temperature and precipitation) remain the primary drivers of crop growth, losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture. On average, farms in the United States lose up to six billion pounds of crops every year because of these unpredictable conditions. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Economic factors, such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance, also cause food waste; farmers often harvest selectively, preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field (where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed), since they would otherwise be discarded later. This method of removing undesirable produce from harvest collection, distribution sites and grocery stores is called Culling. The USDA defines culling as “the individual removal of genetically undesirable, inferior, weak, diseased, or infested plants from a planting in order to ensure the level of genetic purity or vigor of the crop”. However, usually when culling occurs at the production, food processing, retail and consumption stages, it is to remove or dispose of produce with a strange or imperfect appearance rather than produce that is spoiled or unsafe to eat. In urban areas, fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either don't realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated, despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume.\n\nFood waste continues in the post-harvest stage, but the amounts of post-harvest loss involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate. Regardless, the variety of factors that contribute to food waste, both biological/environmental and socio-economical, would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures. In storage, considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to pests and micro-organisms. This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat (around 30 °C) and ambient humidity (between 70 and 90 per cent), as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro-organisms. Losses in the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops, by extremes of temperature, humidity or the action of micro-organisms, also account for food waste. Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume.\n\nSome of the food waste produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product. Food safety regulations are able to claim foods which contradict standards before they reach markets. Although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food waste (such as in animal feed), safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer; they are vitally important, especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin (e.g. meat and dairy products), as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards.\n\nPackaging protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing, as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival. Although it avoids considerable food waste, packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways, such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks.\n\nIn 2013 the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) performed research that they state suggests that the leading cause of food waste in America is due to uncertainty over food expiration dates, such as confusion in deciphering best before, sell-by or use-by dates. Joined by Harvard Law, the NRDC produced a study called \"The Dating Game: How Confusing Food Date Labels Leads to Food Waste in America\". This United States-based study looked at the intertwining laws which lead labeling to end up unclear and erratic. This uncertainty leads to consumers to toss food, most often because they think the food may be unsafe or misunderstand the labeling on the food completely. Lack of regulation on labeling can result in large quantities of food being removed from the market overall.\n\nRetail stores throw away large quantities of food. Usually, this consists of items that have reached either their best before, sell-by or use-by dates. Food that has passed the best before, and sell-by date, and even some food that passed the use-by date is still edible at the time of disposal, but stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food. Some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people, while others work with charitable organizations to distribute food. Retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers. Failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled. As a consequence, they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract, to have a margin of error. Surplus production is often simply disposed of.\n\nRetailers usually have strict cosmetic standards for produce, and if fruits or vegetables are misshapen or superficially bruised, they are often not put on the shelf. In the United States, an estimated six billion pounds of produce is wasted each year because of its appearance. The USDA publishes guidelines used as a baseline assessment by produce distributors, grocery stores, restaurants and other consumers in order to rate the quality of food. These guidelines and how they rate are readily available on their website. For example, apples get graded by their size, color, wax residue, firmness, and skin appearance. If an apples rank highly in these categories and show close to no superficial defects, they are rated as “U.S. Extra Fancy” or “U.S. Fancy”, these are the typical ratings sought out by grocery stores when purchasing their produce. Any apples with suboptimal levels of appearance are ranked as either “U.S. Number 1” or “Utility” and are not normally purchased for retail, as recommended by produce marketing sources, despite being safe and edible.\n\nThe fish industry also contributes to the annual amount of food waste because of cosmetic standards that the fish are held up to. Nearly \"2.3 million tonnes of fish (are) discarded in the North Atlantic and the North Sea each year.\" Approximately 40 to 60 percent of \"all fish caught in Europe is discarded – either because they are the wrong size or species.\" Addressing this, there are many campaigns focused on raising retailer and consumer awareness about food that fails to meet certain standards for appearance.\n\nConsumers are directly and indirectly responsible for wasting a lot of food, which could for a large part be avoided if they were willing to accept suboptimal food (SOF) that deviates in sensory characteristics (odd shapes, discolourations) or has a best-before date that is approaching or has passed, but is still perfectly fine to eat. COSUS (COnsumers in a SUStainable food supply chain) is a SUSFOOD ERA-net research project under the topic 'Understanding consumer behaviour to encourage a (more) sustainable food choice'.\n\nThe 2011 SIK study estimated the total of global food loss and waste to around one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption, amounting to about per year. As the following table shows, industrialized and developing countries differ substantially. In developing countries, it is estimated that 400–500 calories per day per person are going to waste, while in developed countries 1,500 calories per day per person are wasted. In the former, more than 40% of losses occur at the postharvest and processing stages, while in the latter, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels. The total food waste by consumers in industrialized countries () is almost equal to the entire food production in sub-Saharan Africa ().\n\nA 2013 report from the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) likewise estimated that 30–50% (or ) of all food produced remains uneaten.\n\nIn Singapore, of food was wasted in 2014. Of that, were recycled. Since Singapore has limited agriculture ability, the country spent about S$14.8 billion (US$10.6 billion) on importing food in 2014. US$1.4 billion of it ends up being wasted, or 13 percent.\n\nIn the UK, per year of wasted food (purchased and edible food which is discarded) amounts to a cost of £10.2 billion each year. This represents costs of £250 to £400 a year per household.\n\nEstimates of food waste in the United States range from 35 million tons to 103 million tons. In a study done by National Geographic in 2014, Elizabeth Royte indicated more than 30 percent of food in the United States, valued at $162 billion annually, isn't eaten. The University of Arizona conducted a study in 2004, which indicated that 14 to 15% of United States edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to $43 billion worth of discarded, but edible, food. In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture has come forth with estimations from the Economic Research Service that approximates food waste in the United States to be equivalent to 141 trillion calories.\n\nAccording to Ministry of Environment (Denmark), over 700,000 tonnes per year of food is wasted every year in Denmark in the entire food value chain from farm to fork. Due to the work of activist Selina Juul's Stop Wasting Food movement, Denmark has achieved a national reduction in food waste by 25% in 5 years (2010–2015).\n\nAccording to the research of National Food Chain Safety Office, an average Hungarian consumer gerenates 68 kg food waste annually. 49% of this amount would be avoidable.\n\nAccording to a publication of Wageningen University and Research report it is estimated that in the Netherlands, between 30% and 50% of all food produced is lost or thrown away. In total, people in the Netherlands waste at least 9.5m tonnes of food per year, worth at least €4.4bn.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food waste is responsible for 8 percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe FAO concludes that nearly 30 percent of all available agricultural land in the world - 1.4 billion hectares - is used for produced but uneaten food. The global blue water footprint of food waste is 250 km, that is the amount of water that flows annually through the Volga or 3 times Lake Geneva.\n\nResponse to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely, including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups, and concentrated media attention on the subject.\n\nOne way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping, avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases, and storing foods properly. Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste. A British campaign called “Love Food Hate Waste” has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers. Through advertisements, information on food storage and preparation and in-store education, the UK observed a 21% decrease in avoidable household food waste over the course of 5 years. Another potential solution is for \"smart packaging\" which would indicate when food is spoiled more precisely than expiration dates currently do, for example with temperature-sensitive ink, plastic that changes color when exposed to oxygen, or gels that change color with time.\n\nAn initiative in Curitiba, Brazil called Cambio Verde allows farmers to provide surplus produce (produce they would otherwise discard due to too low prices) to people that bring glass and metal to recycling facilities (to encourage further waste reduction). In Europe, the Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network (FSE Network), coordinates a network of social businesses and nonprofit initiatives with the goal to spread best practices to increase the use of surplus food and reduction of food waste.\n\nIn areas where the waste collection is a public function, food waste is usually managed by the same governmental organization as other waste collection. Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as source-separated organics, have the advantage that food wastes can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste.\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called \"garbage\" as opposed to \"trash\") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.\n\nSeparate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas. To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced \"alternate weekly collections\" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts vermin. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible. Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse.\n\nAs alternatives to landfill, food waste can be composted to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals, or used to produce energy or fuel.\n\nDumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add biological oxygen demand (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union Landfill Directive and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries, enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons. Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.\n\nIn countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste dumped in landfills, where it ends up rotting and producing methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nMethane, or CH, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO, it's more efficient at trapping radiation. It is 25 times greater to impact climate change than CO in a 100-year period. Humans accounts over 60% of methane emissions globally.\n\nLarge quantities of fish, meat, dairy and grain are discarded at a global scale annually, when they can be used for things other than human consumption. The feeding of food scraps to domesticated animals is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste. The animals turn roughly two thirds of their ingested food into gas or fecal waste, while the last third is digested and repurposed as meat or dairy products. There are also different ways of growing produce and feeding livestock that could ultimately reduce waste.\n\nBread and other cereal products discarded from the human food chain could be used to feed chickens. Chickens have traditionally been given mixtures of waste grains and milling by-products in a mixture called chicken scratch. As well, giving table scraps to backyard chickens is a large part of that movement's claim to sustainability, though not all backyard chicken growers recommend it. Ruminants and pigs have also been fed bakery waste for a long time.\n\nCertain food waste (such as flesh) can also be used as feed in maggot farming. The maggots can then be fed to other animals.\n\nFood waste can be biodegraded by composting, and reused to fertilize soil. Composting is the aerobic process completed by microorganisms in which the bacteria break down the food waste into simpler organic materials that can then be used in soil. By redistributing nutrients and high microbial populations, compost reduces water runoff and soil erosion by enhancing rainfall penetration, which has been shown to reduce the loss of sediment, nutrients, and pesticide losses to streams by 75–95%.\n\nTraditional composting uses microbes to perform the decomposition, a process that is most efficient using low, mid, and high temperature microbes (psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic – respectively). The high temperatures required by the thermophilic microorganisms are hot enough to kill pathogens, making the product of this traditional composting satisfactory for use in soil according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standards. The traditional decomposition process requires a long length of time and additional energy expended to turn the material frequently and maintain the aerobic process. Composting by thermophilic microbes can lead to nutrient loss and the compost product is heterogeneous, with the potential for higher levels of contaminants which can be harmful if used in agriculture. An alternate method of composting is vermicomposting.\n\nVermicomposting is the practise of feeding scraps to worms who produce fertilized soil as a byproduct. The process of composting using earth worms is completed in a short duration of time and requires no additional energy to turn and maintain aerobic processes, as these actions are already performed by the worms. In order to keep the worms alive, the environment has to be kept below 35° Celsius, therein making this compost ineligible for use in agriculture according to the EPA standards. The product of vermicomposting is homogenous and generally contains lower levels of contaminants than traditional composting. Some look to integrate vermicomposting and traditional composting in an effort to maximize efficiency while producing a high quality organic product that can be used in agriculture.\n\nComposting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture. Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food. Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.\n\nMunicipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning. Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space. One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco, who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own, instituting fines for non-compliance at $100 for individual homes and $500 for businesses. The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting. Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds.\n\nAnaerobic digestion produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous \"compostable\" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills. Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.\n\nSince this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning. These interactions require proper maintenance and personal protective equipment is utilized. Certain U.S. states, such as Oregon, have implemented the requirement for permits on such facilities, based on the potential danger to the population and surrounding environment.\n\nFood waste coming through the sanitary sewers from garbage disposal units is treated along with other sewage and contributes to sludge.\n\nCommercially, food waste in the form of wastewater coming from commercial kitchens’ sinks, dishwashers and floor drains is collected in holding tanks called grease interceptors to minimize flow to the sewer system. This often foul-smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste (chemical cleaners, etc.) and may also contain hazardous hydrogen sulfide gases. It is referred to as fats, oils, and grease (FOG) waste or more commonly \"brown grease\" (versus \"yellow grease\", which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel) and is an overwhelming problem, especially in the US, for the aging sewer systems. Per the US EPA, sanitary sewer overflows also occur due to the improper discharge of FOGs to the collection system. Overflows discharge – of untreated wastewater annually into local waterways, and up to 3,700 illnesses annually are due to exposure to contamination from sanitary sewer overflows into recreational waters.\n\nNearly all global produce, eaten or disposed of is grown using irrigated water. Irrigated water represents the largest sector of water withdraws worldwide, with as much as 90% of total water withdraws being allocated towards agricultural usage.

The term is derived from the French word for \"Monkey Trick\".\n\nThe practise can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt; Cyril Aldred detected a love of \"singerie\" that he found characteristic of the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt; Throughout the medieval period in Europe, monkeys were seen \"as a symbol of downgraded humanity\", and were used to mimic man and his foibles, often appearing in the margins of illuminated manuscripts.\n\nComical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment originated as a pictorial genre in Flemish painting in the 16th century and were further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists, in particular by those in Antwerp such as Frans Francken the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Elder and the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders. Later in the 17th century artists like Nicolaes van Verendael, principally known as a painter of flower still lifes started to paint ‘monkey scenes’ as well.\n\"Singeries\" became popular among French artists in the early 18th century. French decorator and designer Jean Berain the Elder included dressed figures of monkeys in many wall decorations, the great royal \"ébéniste\" André Charles Boulle used them in his work and Watteau painted \"The Monkey Sculptor\", a critique of art and artists' habit of \"aping\" nature.\n\nA complete monkey orchestra was produced in Meissen porcelain. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's \"Grande Singerie\" and \"Petite Singerie\" decors at the Château de Chantilly; in England the French painter Andieu de Clermont is also known for his \"singeries\": the most famous decorates the ceiling of the Monkey Room at Monkey Island Hotel, located on Monkey Island in Bray-on-Thames, England. The Grade I listed buildings, which have housed guests since 1840 were built in the 1740s by Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough.\nSingeries regained popularity in the 19th century and artists then successful in this genre included Zacharie Noterman, Emmanuel Noterman, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Edmund Bristow, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Charles Monginot and Paul Friedrich Meyerheim.\n\n"}

It is one of the largest civil engineering projects in the western hemisphere, moving nearly of soil and rock, compared to the Big Dig (15 million cubic yards) and the Panama Canal (240 million cubic yards). Dr. William Hambley, who served as mayor of Pikeville for 29 years, Robert H. Holcomb, Chamber of Commerce president, and Henry Stratton, local attorney, spearheaded the project.\n\nThe Pikeville Cut-Through is wide, long, and is deep. The project was completed in 1987 following 14 years of work at a cost of $77.6 million ($ in dollars).\n\nThe project was initially envisioned by Pikeville native Dr. William Hambley in 1960. He simply wanted to relocate the railbed because he wanted to eliminate the dust that came from the coal hauling trains that passed through the city daily. In 1963, Pikeville received a $38,000 federal grant for a railroad relocation feasibility study and was named a Model City by the recently formed Model Cities Agency, generating even more funding. By 1965, his plan had further developed to accommodate Corridor B of the Appalachian Development Highway System, assuring the construction of the Pikeville Cut-Through.\n\nIt was also decided to relocate the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, which then snaked through the downtown area, to eliminate almost yearly flooding. The river bed then was to be reclaimed, significantly increasing the available space for development within the city.\n\nThe project was constructed in four phases by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between November 26, 1973 and October 2, 1987.\n\nPhase I of construction began on November 26, 1973. By the end of Phase I, nearly of rock were blasted from Peach Orchard Mountain to create a channel for the road, railroad, and river. The cost of phase I at completion was $17,250,000.\n\nPhase II of construction began on March 4, 1980. During this phase the coal tipples and railroad tracks were removed from downtown Pikeville, a bridge was constructed across the cut, the river was rerouted, and the former riverbed was filled. of soil was moved to create of available land in downtown at a cost of $19,700,000.\n\nPhase III and IV of construction began on March 15, 1983. The final stages consisted of: the construction of the downtown interchanges and flood walls, another new bridge, and the construction of Hambley Boulevard atop the former railbed – a lasting tribute to William Hambley. These two phases created an additional of downtown property at a cost of $19,700,000.\n\nThe project was dedicated on October 2, 1987.\n\n"}

In one version of Julebukking, people go from door to door singing Christmas songs. After they have sung, they are usually awarded with candy. Another tradition requires that at least one person from the visited household join the band of Julebukkers and continue to the next household. \n\nIn certain aspects, the custom resembled the modern-day tradition of Halloween trick-or-treating. Julebukkers will often disguise their voices and body language to further the masquerade. Offering people holiday treats and something to drink is customary. Once identities are known and the food is eaten, the Julebukkers continue to the next home.\n\nThe earliest form of Julebukking was a pre-Christian pagan ritual. The tradition of the Yule goat (\"Julebukk\") is commonly believed to have originated in Norway, at a time when pagans worshiped Thor, the god who traveled in his chariot drawn by two goats. During the Yule holiday, they would disguise their appearance by dressing in a goatskin and go from house to house carrying a goat head. \n\nChristian missionaries modified the tradition and divorced its meaning from Paganism. The Yule Goat became one of the oldest Scandinavian and Northern European Yule and Christmas symbols and traditions. In Scandinavia, the figure of the Yule Goat remains a common Christmas ornament. It is often made out of straw, has a red ribbon around its neck, and is found under the Christmas tree. \n\nGerman and Scandinavian immigrants brought this tradition to America. Though the practice of Julebukking may be dying out in Europe, it can still be observed on occasion in rural communities in America with large populations of people of Scandinavian descent, such as in Petersburg, Alaska and Ketchikan, Alaska.\n\n"}

Its defining characteristics are interpreted differently from region to region. It is popular in the cuisines of several regions of Spain, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. In the Philippines, it is called longganisa and differs greatly with hundreds of variants with different vernacular tastes and forms due to the 144 ethno-linguistic groups in the archipelago.\n\nIn Spain, longaniza are long thin \"salchichón\" that differ from chorizo in that they substitute black pepper for paprika and may have different spices like nutmeg.\n\nIn Argentina and Uruguay, longaniza is a very long, cured and dried pork sausage that gets its particular flavour from ground anise seeds. This results in a very particular aroma, and a mildly sweet flavour that contrasts with the strong salty taste of the stuffing. It is used mainly as an appetizer or in sandwiches, and very rarely cooked.\n\nIn Chile, longaniza may be eaten during a barbecue with bread as a choripán. The city of Chillán is known for its longanizas. Chillán's football team Ñublense are nicknamed \"The Clockwork Longaniza\" (Spanish: \"La longaniza mecánica\"). During the festivities of the 18th of September, longaniza is prepared in great quantities.\n\nMexican longaniza tends to be longer than Mexican chorizo and is spicier.\n\nPuerto Rican style longaniza is made of pork, but also is made with chicken or turkey. The red orange color is from the addition of annatto seeds. Rice with longaniza is a popular dish.\n\nSince colonial times, Dominican style longaniza has been prepared with the juice of bitter oranges (or lime), garlic, oregano and salt. For the casing, pork intestines are used. Then the longaniza is left to cure in the sun for some days. It is eaten fried in its own fats or in vegetable oil. Quality varies considerably because it is generally home-made. Best quality longaniza usually has a 70% lean fat content.\n\n\"Longaniza\" or \"longganisa\" (also called \"chorizo\", \"choriso\", \"tosriso\", or \"soriso\" in Visayan regions) refers to sausages flavoured with indigenous spices. They are commonly dyed red, yellow, or orange with achuete seeds. \n\n\"Longganisa\" are usually fresh or smoked sausages, typically made with varying ratios of lean meat and fat, along with garlic, black pepper, salt (usually coarse sea salt), saltpeter, muscovado or brown sugar, and vinegar. Variants may add paprika, chili, anise liqueur, and other spices. Most \"longganisa\" are classified primarily by either being sweet (\"jamonado\" or \"hamonado\"; Philippine Spanish: longaniza jamonada) or garlicky (\"de recado\" or \"derecado\"; Philippine Spanish: longaniza de recado, \"spice-mixed longganisa\" or literally \"longanissa laden with a set of spices\"). Most \"longganisa\" are made with pork. Unlike the Spanish \"chorizo\" and \"longaniza\", Filipino \"longganisa\" can also be made with chicken, beef, or even tuna. Commercial varieties are made into links, but homemade sausages may be simple patties (bulk sausages) without the casing, known in Philippine English as \"skinless sausages\".\n\nThere are numerous kinds of sausages in the Philippines, usually unique to a specific region like Vigan longganisa, Alaminos longganisa, and Chorizo de Cebu. There are also a few dry sausages like Chorizo de Bilbao and Chorizo de Macao.

The statistics are commonly measured by the absolute number of adherents, the percentage of the absolute growth per year, and the growth of the number of converts in the world. Projections of future religious adherence are based on assumptions that trends, total fertility rates, life expectancy, political climate, conversion rates, secularization, etc will continue. Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and are contentious, but are useful for comparison.\n\nStudies in the 21st century show that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread, Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world. A religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center concludes that global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims. Religious conversion has little impact on Muslim population because the number of people who convert to Islam is nearly offset by those who leave Islam.\n\nWorld religions statistics place the Bahá'í Faith around 0.1% of the world population in recent years. The \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" estimated only 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries, and its evolution to the \"World Christian Database\" (WCD) estimated 7.3 million in 2010 while accredited through the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA). However the WCD stated: \"The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha'i [sic] was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.\" This source's only documented flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than in other cross-national data sets. 2015's estimate is of 7.8 million Bahá'ís in the world.\n\nFrom its origins in the Persian and Ottoman empires of the 19th century the Bahá'í Faith was able to gain converts elsewhere in Asia, Europe, and North America by the early 20th century. John Esslemont performed the first review of the worldwide progress of the religion in 1919. 'Abdu'l-Bahá, son of the founder of the religion, then set goals for the community through his Tablets of the Divine Plan shortly before his death. Shoghi Effendi then initiated systematic pioneering efforts that brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world and converts from more than 2000 tribes and peoples. There were serious setbacks in the Soviet Union where Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist. However plans continued building to 1953 when the Bahá'ís initiated a Ten Year Crusade after plans had focused on Latin America and Europe after WWII. That last stage was largely towards parts of Africa. Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa particularly was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. There was diplomatic pressure from northern arab countries against this development that was eventually overcome. Starting in the 1980s with Perestroyka the Bahá'ís began to re-organize across the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. While sometimes failing to meet official minimums for recognitions as a religion, communities of Bahá'ís do exist from Poland to Mongolia. The worldwide progress was such that the Encyclopædia Britannica (2002) identified the religion as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. It has established Bahá'í Houses of Worship by continental region and been the object of interest and support of diverse non-Bahá'í notable people from Leo Tolstoy to Khalil Gibran to Mohandas K. Gandhi to Desmond Tutu. See List of Bahá'ís for a list of notable Bahá'ís.\n\nARDA/WCD statistics place the Bahá'í Faith as currently the largest religious minority in Iran (despite significant persecution and the overall Iranian diaspora), Panama, and Belize; the second largest international religion in Bolivia, Zambia, and Papua New Guinea; and the third largest international religion in Chad and Kenya. In 2014 the religion was officially recognized in Indonesia and in addition to various countries it is the second largest religion in state of South Carolina – a fact that, despite its small size, got some attention in 2014. Based on data from 2010, Bahá'ís were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the United States. The countries with the fastest annual growth from 2000 to 2015 per annum, where a country has over 100,000 people, were, (starting with the fastest): Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Western Sahara, South Sudan, and Niger, ranging from 3.90% growth per year up to 9.56%.\n\nA Bahá'í published survey reported 4.74 million Bahá'ís in 1987. Bahá'í sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population at \"above 5 million\".\n\nBuddhism is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha, who lived and taught in northeastern India in the 5th century BC. The majority of Buddhists live in Asia; Europe and North America also have populations exceeding 1 million. According to scholars of religious demographics, there are between 488 million, 495 million, and 535 million Buddhists in the world.\n\nAccording to Johnson and Grim, Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137 million were in Asia, to 495 million in 2010, of which 487 million are in Asia. According to them, there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and several Western European countries (1910–2010). More recently (2000–2010), the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and some African countries.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics, through statistical analysis, held Buddhism to be the fastest-growing spiritual tradition in Australia in terms of percentage gain, with a growth of 79.1% for the period 1996 to 2001 (200,000→358,000).\n\nAnd according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, over the next four decades the number of Buddhists around the world is expected to decrease from 487 million in 2010 to 486 million in 2050. The decline is due to several factors such as the low fertility level among Buddhists (1.6 children per woman), and the old age (median age of 34), compare to the overall population.\n\nAccording to a survey of religion in China in the year 2010, the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million (70% of the Chinese), of which 173 million (13%) practice some form of Taoist-defined folk faith. Further in detail, 12 million people have passed some formal initiation into Taoism, or adhere to the official Chinese Taoist Association. Comparing this with other surveys, evidence suggests that nowadays three-fifths to four-fifths of the Chinese believe in folk religion. This shows a significant growth from the 300–400 million people practicing Chinese traditional religion that were estimated in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThis growth reverses the rapid decline that Chinese traditional religion faced in the 20th century. Moreover, Chinese religion has also spread throughout the world following the emigration of Chinese populations, with 672,000 adherents in Canada as of 2010.\n\nAccording to scholars, the rebirth of Chinese traditional religion in China is faster and larger than the spread of other religions in the country, such as Buddhism and Christianity:\nThe number of adherents of the Chinese traditional religion is difficult to count, because:\nThe Chinese folk religion is a \"diffused religion\" rather than \"institutional\". It is a meaning system of social solidarity and identity, ranging from the kinship systems to the community, the state, and the economy, that serves to integrate Chinese culture.\n\nAccording to 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there are 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910. And according to 2012 Pew Research Center survey, within the next four decades, Christians will remain the world's largest religion; if current trends continue, by 2050 the number of Christians will reach 2.9 billion (or 31.4%). \nBy 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. Christians have 2.7 children per woman, which is above replacement level (2.1). According to Pew Research Center study, by 2050 the number of Christians in absolute number is expected to grow to more than double in the next few decades, from 517 million to 1.1 billion in Sub Saharan Africa, from 531 million to 665 million in Latin America and Caribbean, from 287 million to 381 million in Asia, and from 266 million to 287 million in North America.\n\nBy 2050, Christianity is expected to remain the majority of population and the largest religious group in Latin America and Caribbean (89%), North America (66%), Europe (65.2%) and Sub Saharan Africa (59%).\n\nAccording to Mark Jürgensmeyer of the University of California, popular Protestantism is one of the most dynamic religious movements in the contemporary world. Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, due primarily to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively.\n\nThe significant growth of Christianity in non-Western countries led to regional distribution changes of Christians. In 1900, Europe and the Americas were home to the vast majority of the world's Christians (93%). Besides, Christianity has grown enormously in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Pacific. In 2010, 26% of the world's Christians lived in Europe, followed by 24.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 23.8% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 13.2% in Asia and the Pacific, 12.3% in North America, and 1% in the Middle East and North Africa. The study also suggested that by 2050, the global Christian population will change considerably. By 2050, 38% of the world's Christians will live in the Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by 23% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 16% in Europe, 13% in Asia and the Pacific and 10% of the world's Christians will live in North America .\n\nChristianity adds about 65.1 million people annually due to factors such as birth rate, religious conversion and migration, while losing 27.4 million people annually due to factors such as death rate, religious apostasy and immigration. Most of the net growth in the numbers of Christians is in Africa, Latin America and Asia. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, an increasing number of Americans are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated. By 2050, Christianity is expected to remain the majority in the United states (66.4%, down from 78.3% in 2010), and the number of Christians in absolute number is expected to grow from 243 million to 262 million.\n\nChristianity is still the largest religion in Western Europe, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center, 71.0% of the Western European population identified themselves as Christians. According to the same study, a large majority of those who raised as Christians (83%) in Western Europe, still identified themselves as Christians today. On the other hand, Central and Eastern European countries did not experience a decline in the percentage of Christians, as the proportion of Christians in these countries have mostly been stable or even increasing.\n\nAccording to a 2005 paper submitted to a meeting of the American Political Science Association, most of Christianity's growth has occurred in non-Western countries. The paper concludes that the Pentecostalism movement is the fastest-growing religion worldwide. Protestantism is growing as a result of historic missionary activity and indigenous Christian movements by Africans in Africa, and due primarily to conversion in Asia, Latin America, Muslim world, and Oceania. According to Pew Research Center, Christianity is declining in the United states while non-Christian faiths are growing.\n\nThe US Department of State estimated in 2005 that Protestants in Vietnam may have grown by 600% over the previous 10 years. In South Korea, Christianity has grown from 2.0% in 1945 to 20.7% in 1985 and to 29.3% in 2010, And the Catholic Church has increased its membership by 70% in the last ten years. In Singapore, the percentage of Christians among Singaporeans increased from 12.7%, in 1990, to 17.5%, in 2010. In recent years, the number of Chinese Christians has increased significantly; Christians were 4 million before 1949 (3 million Catholics and 1 million Protestants), and are reaching 67 million today, Christianity is reportedly the fastest growing religion in China with average annual rate of 7%. Some reports also show that many of the Chinese Indonesians minority convert to Christianity, Demographer Aris Ananta reported in 2008 that \"anecdotal evidence suggests that more Buddhist Chinese have become Christians as they increased their standards of education\". According to a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in 2006, Christianity has increased significantly in Japan, particularly among youth, and a high number of teens are becoming Christians. In Iran, Christianity is reportedly the fastest growing religion with an average annual rate of 5.2%.\n\nIn 1900, there were only 8.7 million adherents of Christianity in Africa, while in 2010 there were 390 million. It is expected that by 2025 there will be 600 million Christians in Africa. In Nigeria, the percentage of Christians has grown from 21.4%, in 1953, to 50.8%, in 2010. In South Africa, Pentecostalism has grown from 0.2%, in 1951, to 7.6%, in 2001.\n\nCatholic Church membership in 2013 was 1.254 billion, which is 17.7% of the world population, an increase from 437 million, in 1950 and 654 million, in 1970. The main growth areas have been Asia and Africa, 39% and 32%, respectively, since 2000.\n\nSince 2010, the rate of increase was of 0.3% in the Americas and Europe. On the other hand, Eric Kaufman, of University of London, argued that the main reason for expansion of Catholicism and conservative Protestantism along with other religions is because their religions tend to be \"pro-natal\" and they have more children, and not due to religious conversion.\n\nProtestantism is one of the most dynamic religious movements in the contemporary world. From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported Evangelicals grew three times the world's population rate, and twice that of Islam. Evangelical Christian denominations also are among the fastest-growing denominations in some Catholic Christian countries, such as Brazil and France (France jumping from 2% to 3% of the population). In Brazil, the total number of Protestants jumped from 16.2% in 2000 to 22.2% in 2010 (for the first time, the percentage of Catholics in Brazil is less than 70%). These cases don't contribute to a growth of Christianity overall, but rather to a substitution of a brand of Christianity with another one.\n\nAccording to the records of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, its membership has grown every decade since its beginning in the 1830s, that it is among the top ten largest Christian denominations in the U.S., and that it was the fastest growing church in the U.S. in 2012.\n\nStudies and reports estimate significantly more people have converted from Islam to Christianity in the 21st century than at any other point in Islamic history. According to 2015 \"Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census study\" estimates 10.2 million Muslim convert to Christianity around the world. Conversion into Christianity have also been well documented, and reports estimate that hundreds of thousands of Muslims convert to Christianity annually. Significant number of Muslims converted to Christianity can be found in Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, Kosovo, The United States and Central Asia . Many of the Muslims who converts to Christianity face social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes even murder or other punishments for becoming Christians in countries with Muslim majority.\n\nThe 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies. Data from the Pew Research Center has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, most as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry. According to a 2012 study, 17% of Jews in Russia identify themselves as Christians.\n\nWhile according to Pew Research Center survey it is expected that from 2010 to 2050 significant number of Christians will leave their faith. Most of the switching are expected into the unaffiliated and Irreligion. On the other hand, conversion into Christianity have also been well documented. Large increases in the developing world (around 23,000 per day) have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world, mainly in Europe and North America. According to the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\", approximately 2.7 million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" also cited that Christianity rank at first place in net gains through religious conversion. On the other hand, demographer Conrad Hackett of Pew Research Center stated that the World Christian Encyclopedia gives a higher estimate for percent Christian when compared to other cross-national data sets. While according to \"The Oxford Handbook of Religious Conversion\", approximately 15.5 million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, while approximately 11.7 million leave Christianity annually, and most of them become irreligious, resulting in a net gain of 3.8 million. \n\nIt's been reported also that increasing numbers of young people are becoming Christians in several countries. It's been also reported that conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among Korean, Chinese, and Japanese in the United States. By 2012 percentage of Christians on mentioned communities was 71%, more than 30% and 37%, respectively. In 2010 there were approximately 180,000 Arab Americans and about 130,000 Iranian Americans who converted from Islam to Christianity, Studies estimated approximately that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the United States. According to the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\", between 1965 and 1985 about 2.5 million Indonesian converted from Islam to Christianity. Many people who convert to Christianity face persecution.\n\nThe 2001 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) survey, which involved 50,000 participants, reported that the number of participants in the survey identifying themselves as deists grew at the rate of 717% between 1990 and 2001. If this were generalized to the US population as a whole, it would make deism the fastest-growing religious classification in the US for that period, with the reported total of 49,000 self-identified adherents representing about 0.02% of the US population at the time.\n\nHinduism is a growing religion in countries such as Ghana, Russia, Pakistan, and the United States.\n\nAccording to 2011 census, Hinduism has become fastest-growing religion in Australia since 2006 due to migration from India and Fiji.\n\n79.80% of India's population is Hindu, accounting for about 90% of Hindus worldwide. Their 10-year growth rate is estimated at 20% (based on the period 1991 to 2001), corresponding to a yearly growth close to 2%.\n\nIn 1990, 1.1 billion people were Muslims, while in 2010, 1.6 billion people were Muslims. According to the BBC, a comprehensive American study concluded in 2009 the number stood at approximately 23% of the world population with 60% of Muslims living in Asia. From 1990 to 2010, the global Muslim population increased at an average annual rate of 2.2%. By 2030 Muslims are projected to represent about 26.4% of the global population (out of a total of 7.9 billion people). \"Although the religion began in Arabia, by 2002 80% of all believers in Islam lived outside the Arab world\". On the other hand, in 2010, Pew Forum finds \"that statistical data for Muslim conversions are scarce and as per their available information, there is no substantial net gain or loss of Muslims due to religious conversion. It stated that \"the number of people who embrace Islam and those who leave Islam are roughly equal. Thus, this report excludes the religious conversion as a direct factor from the projection of Muslim population growth.\" The growth of Islam from 2010 to 2020 has been estimated at 1.70% due to high birthrates in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The report also shows that the fall in birth rate of the Muslims slowed down the growth rate during 1990 to 2010. It is due to the fall of fertility rate in many Muslim majority countries. Despite the decline Muslims still have the highest birth rate among the world's major religious groups. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Christian Database as of 2007 has Islam as the fastest-growing religion in the world. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood.\nResurgent Islam is one of the most dynamic religious movements in the contemporary world. The Vatican's 2008 yearbook of statistics revealed that for the first time, Islam has outnumbered the Roman Catholics globally. It stated that, \"Islam has overtaken Roman Catholicism as the biggest single religious denomination in the world\", and stated that, \"It is true that while Muslim families, as is well known, continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer\". According to the Foreign Policy, High birth rates were cited as the reason for the Muslim population growth. With 3.1 children per woman, Muslims have higher fertility levels than the world's overall population between 2010 and 2015. High fertility is a major driver of projected Muslim population growth around the world and in particular regions. Between 2010 and 2015, with exception of the Middle East and North Africa, Muslim fertility of any other region in the world was higher than the rate for the region as a whole. While Muslim birth rates are expected to experience a decline, it will remain above replacement level and higher fertility than the world's overall by 2050. As per U.N.'s global population forecasts, as well as the\nPew Research projections, over time fertility rates generally converge toward the\nreplacement level. Globally, Muslims were younger (median age of 23) than the overall population (median age of 28) as of 2010. While decline of Muslim birth rates in coming years have also been well documented. According to David Ignatius, there is major decline in Muslim fertility rates as pointed out by Nicholas Eberstadt. Based on the data from 49 Muslim-majority countries and territories, he founds that Muslims birth rate has significantly dropped for 41% between 1975 and 1980 to 2005–10 while the global population decline was 33% during that period. It also stated that over 50% declined was found in 22 Muslim countries and over 60% decline in Iran, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Libya, Albania, Qatar and Kuwait.\nAccording to the religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center, between 2010 and 2050 modest net gains through religious conversion are expected for Muslims (3 million) and most of the net gains through religious conversion for Muslims found in the Sub Saharan Africa (2.9 million). The study also reveals that, due to young age & relatively high fertility rate among Muslims by 2050 there will be near parity between Muslims (2.8 billion, or 30% of the population) and Christians (2.9 billion, or 31%), possibly for the first time in history. According to Pew Research Center the projected Muslims population will equal the Christian population by 2070. While both religions will grow but Muslim population will exceed the Christian population and by 2100, Muslim population (35%) will be 1% more than the Christian population (34%). By the end of 2100 Muslims are expected to outnumber Christians. According to the same study, Muslims population growth is twice of world's overall population growth due to young age and relatively high fertility rate and as a result Muslims are projected to rise to 30% (2050) of the world's population from 23% (2010).\n\nWhile the total Fertility Rate of Muslims in North America is 2.7 children per woman in the 2010 to 2015 period, well above the regional average (2.0) and the replacement level (2.1). Europe's Muslim population also has higher fertility (2.1) than other religious groups in the region, well above the regional average (1.6). A new study of Population Reference Bureau by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka suggests that the fertility gap between Muslims and non-Muslims is shrinking and although the Muslim immigrants do have more children than other Europeans but their fertility tends to decline over time, often faster than among non-Muslims.\n\nGenerally, there are few reports about how many people leave Islam in Muslim majority countries. The main reason for this is the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, it is also possible that these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in \"Foreign Affairs\" whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many Muslims who leave Islam face social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or other penalties. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.\nIt is reported that around 5,000 British people convert to Islam every year (most of them are women). According to a report by CNN, \"Islam has drawn converts from all walks of life, most notably African-Americans\". Studies estimated approximately 30,000 converting to Islam annually in the United States.\n\nBy 2010 an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), up from 4.1% in 1990. By 2030, Muslims are expected to make up 8% of Europe's population including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%), including 13 million foreign-born Muslim immigrants.<ref name=\"11/17/5\">5 facts about the Muslim population in Europe</ref> Islam is widely considered as the fastest growing religion in Europe due primarily to immigration and above average birth rates. Between 2010 and 2015 the Muslim fertility rate in Europe was (2.1). On the other hand, the fertility rate in Europe as a whole was (1.6). Pew study also reveals that Muslims are younger than other Europeans. In 2010, the median age of Muslims throughout Europe was (32), eight years younger than the median for all Europeans (40). According to a religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center conversion does not add significantly to the growth of the Muslim population in Europe, according to the same study the net loss is (−60,000) due to religious switching.\n\nThe Pew Research Center notes that \"the data that we have isn't pointing in the direction of 'Eurabia' at all\", and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to 8% in 2030, due to immigration and above average birth rates. And only two western European countries – France and Belgium – will become around 10 percent Muslim, by 2030. According to Justin Vaïsse the fertility rate of Muslim immigrants declines with integration. He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group, Most academics who have analysed the demographics dismiss the predictions that the EU will have Muslim majorities.\nIt is completely reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase, and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant impact on European life. The prospect of a homogenous Muslim community per se, or a Muslim majority in Europe is however out of the question. Eric Kaufman of University of London denied the claims of Eurabia. According to him, Muslims will be a significant minority rather than majority in Europe and as per their projections for 2050 in the Western Europe, there will be 10–15 per cent Muslim population in high immigration countries such as Germany, France and the UK. Eric Kaufman also argue that the main reason why Islam is expanding along with other religions, is not because of conversion to Islam, but primarily to the nature of the religion, as he calls it \"pro-natal\", where Muslims tend to have more children. However, Doug Saunders states that by 2030 Muslims and Non-Muslims birth rates will be equal in Germany, Greece, Spain and Denmark without taking account of the Muslims immigration to these countries. He also states that Muslims & Non-Muslims fertility rate difference will decrease from 0.7 to 0.4 and this different will continue to shrink as a result of which Muslims and non-Muslims fertility rate will be identical by 2050.\n\nAccording to the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\", the fastest-growing denomination in Islam is Ahmadiyya with a growth rate of 3.25%, however, most of the Muslim population and scholars do not regard Ahmadis to be Muslims. Most other sects have a growth rate of less than 3%.\n\nIn 2010 Asia was home for (62%) of the world's Muslims, and about (20%) of the world's Muslims lived in the Middle East and North Africa, (16%) in Sub Saharan Africa, and 2% in Europe. By 2050 Asia will home for (52.8%) of the world's Muslims, and about (24.3%) of the world's Muslims will live in Sub Saharan Africa, (20%) the Middle East and North Africa, and 2% in Europe. As per the Pew Research study, Muslim populations will grow in absolute number in all regions of the world between 2010 and 2050. The Muslim population in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to reach nearly 1.5 billion by 2050, up from roughly 1 billion in 2010. The growth of Muslims is also expected in the Middle East-North Africa region, It is projected to increase from about 300 million in 2010 to more than 550 million in 2050. Besides, the Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to grow from about 250 million in 2010 to nearly 670 million in 2050 which is more than double. The absolute number of Muslims is also expected to increase in regions with smaller Muslim populations such as Europe and North America. Due to young age & relatively high fertility rate, Muslim population will rise nearly 30% in 2050. In Europe Muslim population will be nearly double (from 6% to 10%). In North America, it will grow 1% to 2%. In Asia Pasific region, Muslims will surpass the Hindus by the time. In 2010 Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria was home for (48%) of the world's Muslims. By 2050 Pakistan is projected to have the world's largest Muslim population followed by India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Bangladesh, and expected to be home for (45%) of the world's Muslims.\n\nThere exist different views among scholars about the spread of Islam. Islam began in Arabia and from 633 AD until the late 10th century it was spread through conquests, far-reaching trade and missionary activity.\nAccording to Rodney Stark, Islam was spread after military conquests after Arab armies began overtaking Christian regions from Syria to North Africa and Spain, as well as Zoroastrian, Buddhist and Hindu regions in Central Asia, parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia via military invasions, traders and Sufi missionaries. According to some scholars, the Jizya (poll tax) was the most important factor in the mass conversion to Islam, the tax paid by all non-Muslims (Dhimmis – which translated means \"protected persons\") in Islamic empires (such as Christians under Ottoman Empire's authority, Hindus and Buddhists under regime of Muslim invaders, Coptic Christians under administration of the Muslim Arabs, Zoroastrians living under Islamic rule in ancient Persia, and also with Jewish communities in the medieval Arab world) while some scholars acknowledges that Most Muslim rulers in India never consistently collected the jizya (poll tax) from Dhimmis. Under Islamic law, Muslims are required to pay Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam. Muslims take 2.5% out of their salaries and use the funds give to the needy. ; since non-Muslims are not required to pay Zakat, they instead had to pay Jizya if they wanted the same protections the Muslims received.\n\nAccording to other scholars many converted for a whole host of reasons, the main statement of which was evangelisation by Muslims, though there were some instances where some were pressured to convert owing to internal violence and friction between the Christian and Muslim communities, according to historian Philip Jenkins.\nHowever John L. Esposito, a scholar on the subject of Islam in \"The Oxford History of Islam\" states that the spread of Islam \"was often peaceful and sometimes even received favourably by Christians\". In a 2008 conference on religion at Yale University's \"The MacMillan Center Initiative on Religion, Politics, and Society\" which hosted a speech from Hugh Kennedy, he stated forced conversions played little part in the history of the spread of the faith. However, the poll tax known Jizyah may have played a part in converting people over to Islam but as \"Britannica\" notes \"The rate of taxation and methods of collection varied greatly from province to province and were greatly influenced by local pre-Islamic customs\" and there were even cases when Muslims had the tax levied against them, on top of Zakat. Hugh Kennedy has also discussed the Jizyah issue and stated that Muslim governments discouraged conversion but were unable to prevent it.\n\nThe American Religious Identification Survey gives Wicca an average annual growth of 143% for the period 1990 to 2001 (from 8,000 to 134,000 – \"U.S. data\" / similar for Canada & Australia). According to The Statesman Anne Elizabeth Wynn claims \"The two most recent American Religious Identification Surveys declare Wicca, one form of paganism, as the fastest growing spiritual identification in America\". Mary Jones claims Wicca is one of the fastest-growing religions in the United States as well. Wicca, which is largely a \"Pagan\" religion primarily attracts followers of nature-based religions in, as an example, the Southeast Valley region of the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area.\n\nIn terms of absolute numbers, irreligion appears to be increasing (along with secularization generally). (See the geographic distribution of atheism.)\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey in 2012 religiously unaffiliated (include agnostic and atheist) make up about 18.2% of Europeans population.\n\nThe American Religious Identification Survey gave nonreligious groups the largest gain in terms of absolute numbers: 14.3 million (8.4% of the population) to 29.4 million (14.1% of the population) for the period 1990–2001 in the U.S. A 2012 study by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life reports, \"The number of Americans who do not identify with any religion continues to grow at a rapid pace. One-fifth of the U.S. public – and a third of adults under 30 – are religiously unaffiliated today, the highest percentages ever in Pew Research Center polling.\"\n\nA similar pattern has been found in other countries such as Australia, Canada, and Mexico. According to statistics in Canada, the number of \"Nones\" increased by about 60% between 1985 and 2004. In Australia, census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics give \"no religion\" the largest gains in absolute numbers over the 15 years from 1991 to 2006, from 2,948,888 (18.2% of the population that answered the question) to 3,706,555 (21.0% of the population that answered the question). According to INEGI, in Mexico, the number of atheists grows annually by 5.2%, while the number of Catholics grows by 1.7%. In New Zealand, 39% of the population are irreligious making it largest percentage of total population in Oceania region.\n\nAccording to a religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center the percentage of the world's population that unaffiliated or Nonreligious is expected to drop, from 16% of the world's total population in 2010 to 13% in 2050. The decline is largely due to the advanced age (median age of 34) and low fertility among unaffiliated or Nonreligious (1.7 children per woman in the 2010–2015 period). Sociologist Phil Zuckerman's global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.\n\nBy 2050 unaffiliated or Nonreligious was expected to account 27% of North America total population (up from 17.1% as in 2010), and 23% of Europe total population (up from 18% as in 2010) according to Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. The religiously unaffiliated are stationed largely in the Asia-Pacific region, where 76% resided in 2010, and is expected to be 68% by 2050. The share of the global unaffiliated population living in Europe is projected to grow from 12% in 2010 to 13% in 2050. The proportion of the global religiously unaffiliated living in North America, will rise from 5% in 2010, to 9% in 2050.\n\nStatistics on religious adherence are difficult to gather and often contradictory; statistics for the change of religious adherence are even more so, requiring multiple surveys separated by many years using the same data gathering rules. This has only been achieved in rare cases, and then only for particular countries, such as the American Religious Identification Survey in the United States, or census data from Australia (which has included a voluntary religious question since 1911).\n\nThe World Religion Database (WRD) is a peer-reviewed database of international religious statistics based on research conducted at the Institute on Culture, Religion & World Affairs at Boston University. It is published by Brill and is the most comprehensive database of religious demographics available to scholars, providing data for all of the world's countries. Adherence data is largely compiled from census and surveys. The database groups adherents into 18 broadly-defined categories: Agnostics, Atheists, Baha'is, Buddhists, Chinese folk-religionists, Christians, Confucianists, Daoists, Ethnoreligionists, Hindus, Jains, Jews, Muslims, New Religionists, Shintoists, Sikhs, Spiritists, and Zoroastrians. The WRD is edited by demographers Todd M. Johnson and Brian J. Grim.\n\nProjections of future religious adherence are based on assumptions that trends, total fertility rates, life expectancy, political climate, conversion rates, secularization, etc will continue. Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and are contentious, but are useful for comparison.\n\n\n\n"}

It is used to mimic a large variety of aquatic insect larvae that many fish including trout feed upon. It is also widely referred to as the Sawyer’s Pheasant Tail, in relation to the original creator of this fly.\n\nOriginally conceived and tied by Frank Sawyer MBE, an English River Keeper, the Pheasant Tail Nymph is one of the oldest of modern nymphs.\n\nFrank devised the pattern for use on the chalkstreams of Southern England. He designed this nymph to imitate several species of the Baetis family, generally referred to as the 'olives'; it quickly became world famous.\n\nFrank Sawyers’ book \"Nymphs and the Trout\" first published in 1958 describes the method of tying and fishing the nymph. The design of the fly is significantly different from other flies in that Sawyer did not use thread to construct the fly, instead opting to use very fine copper wire. This has two effects; it adds weight to the fly, enabling it to be fished deeper than similar patterns (see below), and adds a subtle brightness to an otherwise drab fly. \n\nFrank twisted the wire and pheasant tail fibers around one another, and wrapped them forward together, forming the thorax and abdomen. A few good variations have been developed over the years, but when you strip them away, it's still Sawyer's elegantly simple, devastatingly effective nymph.\n\nFrank’s Pheasant Tail suggests many of the skinny nymphs that flourish in various habitats, exciting riffles to alluring deep holes in the rivers bed of chalk streams or spring creeks; and in stillwaters of all sizes.\n\nIn streams and rivers, the Pheasant Tail can be presented below the surface if required, but it is at its most productive when allowed to sink close to the river bed on a dead drift and then gently raised in the water to imitate the behaviour of the natural insect. This behaviour of the fly stimulates trout to regard the fly as natural food, and to try to eat it, at which point the hook can be set. This technique has become known as the \"Induced Take\", and the development of this technique may be considered to be as important as the development of the fly itself.\n\nIn chalk streams and spring creeks trout often take up station at the most advantageous feeding position. Cast upstream and allow the current to present your Pheasant Tail in a natural manner. Alternatively, cast across the stream, allow the fly to sink, and as the fly approaches the feeding trout stop the line and allow the fly to rise in the water. Watch the trout if you can, or alternatively watch the tip of the fly line for any movement and, if seen, lift the rod tip and gently set the hook.\n\nOn lakes, this is a very effective fly in the middle of the day during the Callibaetis season. Use a floating line with greased sunken leader, retrieve the fly very slowly just below the surface. Pay particular attention to shallow areas near weed beds\n\nIn the UK, Sawyer's Pheasant Tail Nymph is an excellent imitation of \"agile darter\" nymphs, specifically Lake Olive (Cloëon simile) and Pond Olive (Cloëon dipterum) at any time of day, and can even be used during a midge (chironomidae) hatch.\n\n"}

The trump is determined during a first phase in the game. A player \"asks\" for a colour, and the next players can pass, join him, ask another colour or ask another game. The colours have a hierarchy: hearts is the most valuable, followed by diamonds, followed by clubs and the spades are the least valuable.\n\nWhen multiple colours are in the running for the trump, a bidding process determines which one will become the trump. The colour worth the least must always bid one trick higher. The amount to which had been bid is the minimum number of tricks they must win to win the game. The number of tricks usually starts at five or six if a player is alone and at seven or eight when he has a partner, these specifics are very much subject to change. Partners cannot converse while bidding and only the one that joins can do the bidding. He has the option to \"pass parole\", allowing his partner to decide. This is however only permitted once the bid reaches 10.\n\nNote that there are as many variant rules as there are groups that play the game.\n\nThis is also the hierarchy, a lower game will overrule a higher one.\n\nSome player groups may choose to play without small misery, picollissimo and picollo, as these \"special modes\" are otherwise chosen too often. Some groups also play without the possibility of re-dealing when all players bid on different suits.\n\nThis is all very much subject to change. Everyone uses their own rules.\nNote that if a game is 2vs2 each player will win or lose this number of points. If a game is 3vs1, the one going alone will win (or lose) 3x this number.

It is called ptichye moloko (птичье молоко, ) in Russian, lapte de pasăre () in Romanian, ptashyne moloko (пташине молоко) in Ukrainian, and linnupiim in Estonian. All these names literally mean \"bird's milk\" or crop milk, a substance somewhat resembling milk, produced by certain birds to feed their young. However, this is not the origin of the name; rather, \"bird's milk\" is an idiom of ancient Greek origin meaning \"an unobtainable delicacy\" (compare English: \"hen's teeth\").\n\nIt is one of the most recognized chocolate confectionery in Poland having exclusive rights for the name. Other confectionery producers also make similar candies but named differently (e.g. \"Alpejskie mleczko\", \"Alpine milk\"). Nonetheless, \"Ptasie mleczko\" is often used to refer similar candies with vanilla, cream, lemon or chocolate taste.\n\nIn Russia \"ptichye moloko\" is both a popular candy and a famous soufflé cake. The brand was introduced in the Soviet times and is nowadays used by the companies operating the factories which produced these candies and cakes since that time. The candies are also produced in other post-Soviet states, in particular in Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and Estonia.\n\nThe concept of avian milk (, \"ornithon gala\") stretches back to ancient Greece. Aristophanes uses \"the milk of the birds\" in the plays \"The Birds\" and \"The Wasps\" as a proverbial rarity. The expression is also found in Strabo's \"Geographica\" where the island of Samos is described as a \"blest country\" to which \"those who praise it do not hesitate to apply the proverb that \"it produces even bird's milk\" (φέρει καί ὀρνίθων γάλα)\". A similar expression \"lac gallinaceum\" (Latin for \"chicken's milk\") was also later used by Petronius (38.1) and Pliny the Elder (Plin. \"Nat.\" pr. 24) as a term for a great rarity. The idiom became later common in many languages and appeared in Slavic folk tales. In one such tale the beautiful princess tests the ardor and resourcefulness of her suitor by sending him out into the wilderness to find and bring back the one fantastical luxury she does not have: bird's milk. In the fairy tale \"Little Hare\" by Aleksey Remizov (who wrote many imitations of traditional Slavic folk tales) the magic bird Gagana produces milk.\n\nIn Poland, Jan Wedel, owner of the E. Wedel Company, developed the first \"ptasie mleczko\" in 1936. According to the company's official history, Wedel's inspiration for the name of the confectionery came from his voyages to France, when he asked himself: \"What could bring greater happiness to a man who already has everything?\" Then he thought: \"Maybe only bird milk.\"\n\nIn Russia, \"ptichye moloko\" was originally a type of candy introduced in 1967 in Vladivostok and in 1968 by the Rot Front factory in Moscow. It became a hit, and mass production was started in 1975 by the Krasny Oktyabr (\"Red October\") confectionery factory in Moscow.\nIn 1978, the popular candy was transformed into a cake by Vladimir Guralnik in Moscow's Praga Restaurant. This was a light sponge cake filled with an airy soufflé and topped with chocolate glaze. A distinct feature of the Russian recipe is the usage of agar-agar instead of gelatin as a thickening agent which withstands the high temperature needed to reach the optimum soufflé consistency. The recipe was quickly copied by other restaurants in Moscow, such as Moskva, Budapesht, and Ukraina. In the 1980s, a special factory for \"ptichye moloko\" cakes was built in the Novye Cheryomushky district in the south of Moscow. Both the cake and the candy versions of \"ptichye moloko\" are widely available to this date in supermarkets and specialty stores all over Russia.\n\nIn Estonia, \"linnupiim\" (also \"bird's milk\" in Estonian) is the brand name of a similar candy made by the Kalev candy factory. This candy uses agar-agar instead of gelatin as a thickening agent and comes in three flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and lemon.\n\nIn Moldova, \"lapte de pasăre\" (also \"bird's milk\" in Romanian) is the brand name of a similar candy made by the Bucuria candy factory. Despite the name, the candy is not to be confused with the Romanian traditional dessert lapte de pasăre.\n\nThe phrases \"Ptasie Mleczko\", \"Lait d'oiseau\", \"Vogelmilch\", and \"Ptiche Moloko\" are registered trademarks in the EU.\n\nIn Russia, \"Птичье молоко\" is a registered trademark of Rot Front, a member of United Confectioners.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7906426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7906426", "title": "Quadrille Ball", "text": "Quadrille Ball\n\nQuadrille Ball is an annual society ball that has taken place in New York City each year since 1961, usually in January or February. It is a non-profit event that benefits the Germanistic Society, which in turn awards scholarships for German graduate students. The event is normally held at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. In 2006, due to the Plaza being closed for renovations, the ball was held at the Pierre Hotel instead.\n\nThe main performance at the ball is the Quadrille dance, hence the name of the ball. The Quadrille dance is performed each year by a new batch of debutantes (female and male, generally ages 21–30) who are paired up as couples. Most years there are 20 couples, but this number can vary slightly from year to year, although the total number of couples in the performance must be divisible by the number four, since the root word \"quad\" refers to the number four, and couples are arranged in squares of four couples each, as in American square dancing. Each couple is announced as they are first presented and make their way onto the ballroom floor. There is also a Caller who keeps announcing what steps are to be done next, throughout the dance. The tempo of the Quadrille dance is slow and stately, which lends an elegant and aristocratic air to the performance. The steps date back to the 17th century, when they were done by nobility in the royal courts of Europe. Since the Quadrille Ball always presents the same exact dance steps each year, the debutantes from previous years (called alumni) simply pass down the steps to the new debutantes, so therefore the ball does not need a choreographer to create new steps each year. After the Quadrille dance presentation, any alumni present are invited up for an honorary alumni waltz (improvisational), and then there is social dancing the rest of the night to a live orchestra that plays ballroom dance music (waltz, tango, foxtrot, swing, Latin, etc.).\n\nDebutantes are only supposed to perform once, and then they become alumni and have the option of applying to join the Junior Committee, which helps to train the next year's debutantes. Weekly rehearsals, which are organized by the Junior Committee, take place during the three months leading up to the ball (November, December, and January). After-parties are arranged following each rehearsal, in order to encourage camaraderie and social interaction among participants, and often are held at the private residences of alumni. New debutantes are usually referred by alumni, but the ball also considers applications from people who have no prior connection to the ball.\n\nOne interesting thing about this ball is that even though it is a German organized ball, the Caller announces the steps entirely in French. This can be explained by the fact that French used to be the universal language of European courts centuries ago when the Quadrille dance was invented, and therefore the steps are codified in the French language.\n\nDuring the 57th Quadrille Ball, on January 28th, 2017, Charlie O'Loughlin participated as a dancer and danced with Debbie Chiang He was featured in the New York Times at the event.\n\n"}

Kaggor the storm giant first appeared in \"Thor\" #193 (November 1971).\n\nThe Giants of Jotunheim are enormous beings that reside in the other-dimensional realm of Jotunheim, one of the Nine Realms in Asgardian cosmology. They are the traditional enemies of the gods of Asgard, with whom they have warred off and on for millennia, trying to bring eternal night to Asgard. Each of the giants can range from 20 feet to 30 feet in height.\n\nThe first of the Giants was the Ice Giant, Ymir, who existed before any of the Asgardians. He fought Odin but was imprisoned in a ring of flame. Many different races of Giants arose in Jotunheim, including the Frost Giants, the Ice Giants, the Mountain Giants, the Rime Giants, and the Storm Giants.\n\nThe Giants of Olympus are based on the Giants of Greek Mythology. As in the Greek myths, Gaea fertilized them from the blood of Uranus. Following the defeat of the Titans, Gaea sought for a way to make the Giants immortal like the Olympians. To keep Gaea from finding a solution to this, Zeus withheld Helios, Eos, and Selene from the night sky so that Gaea wouldn't find it. The Giants were prophesied by the female Titan Themis to be indestructible and could not be killed by a god or an immortal. Zeus obtained the help of his son Hercules to help fight them. Each of the Giants were killed in the similar way as in the actual Greek mythology.\n\nIn recent years, a blind Giant named Zeno and a one-armed giant named Callias encountered Hulk near the entrance to Tartarus where they held a meal to honor their brethren that are imprisoned there. They shared their meal with Hulk until it was interrupted by an attack from Ares. This attack ended up causing Hulk to attack Mount Olympus upon Hulk being convinced by Zeno and Callias that the Olympian Gods were his enemies. Callias and Zeno rallied the Giants into breaking the seal on Tartarus which ended up freeing Cronus. Cronus, Callias, and Zeno then stormed Mount Olympus only to end up fighting Hulk and Hercules. Hercules managed to slay Callias and Zeno before resealing Tartarus after throwing Cronus back into Tartarus.\n\nSome years later, Hulk was invited to Mount Olympus as a guest of the Olympians. He and Hercules later took a path where they ended up fighting some Giants.\n\nDuring The Asgard/Shi'ar War, the Shi'ar's version of the Giants were spawned from the dust of the Shi'ar Gods Sharra and K'ythri in their Challenge of the Gods that the Shi'ar Gods did on the Asgardian Gods. The Shi'ar Giants fought against the female Thor. She tried to stop them from committing indiscriminate murders in which in failing to create life, she lost that round to the Shi'ar Gods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel universe, Frost Giants appear once again as Loki's henchmen in \"Ultimate Comics: Thor\". One of the more prominent ones is named Mammoth, who is Loki's half-brother.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Usually, the syrup is added after the ice has been frozen and shaved—typically at the point of sale. However, flavoring can also be added before freezing. The dessert is consumed worldwide in various forms and manners. Shaved ice can also be mixed with large quantities of liquid to produce shaved ice drinks.\n\nMany shaved ices are confused with \"Italian ice\". \"Italian ice\", also known as \"water ice\", has the flavoring incorporated into the ice before it is frozen (although some commercial brands are flavored after production). Shaved ice—especially highly commercial shaved ice (such as that found in food chains or from street vendors)—is often flavored after the ice has been frozen and shaved. Snow cones are an example of shaved ice that is flavored after production.\n\nThe first documented \"shaved ice\" dessert was made in 27 B.C.E. The Roman Emperor Nero sent slaves to collect snow from nearby mountains that he then flavored with a fruit and honey mixture.\n\nIn imperial Japan, the dessert was also a treat reserved for royalty, as it was made of natural ice formed during the coldest period of winter, which was stored in icehouses. This made it very rare, and a supreme luxury available only to the Heian nobles; ordinary people could not afford it. As Japanese immigrated to Hawaii, they brought this tradition with them. Like Rome and Japan, in Hawaii warm areas are close enough to snow-capped mountains that snow can be brought into the warm areas without melting.\n\n\nCentral and South America shaved ice desserts have influences from both North American and Japanese cultures\n\nIn East Asia, shaved ice desserts are not only flavoured with various types of syrup. It is also common to add solid ingredients such as red bean paste, jellies, canned fruits, jams, sweetened condensed milk, and many other types of sweetened foods to vary the textures of the ice dessert.\n\nIn South Asia, snow cones are enjoyed as a low-cost summer treat, often shaved by hand.\n\nIn Israel shaved ice is known as 'Barad', which is Hebrew for hail (ברד), following the Spanish \"granizado\".

While the product can resemble a snow cone, snow cones are made with crushed, rather than shaved, ice. On the Big Island of Hawai'i, it is also referred to as 'ice shave', though both terms (ice shave and shave ice) are used by locals.\n\nShaving produces a very fine ice that appears snow-like. Flavored syrups are added to the ice, which are absorbed by the ice instead of surrounding it. A properly made shave ice product rarely requires a straw, since the flavors are in the ice and not at the bottom of the cup. Although the traditional American flavors are common, shave ice in Hawai'i is often flavored with local ingredients such as guava, pineapple, coconut cream, passion fruit, li hing mui, lychee, kiwi fruit and mango. Hawaiian shave ice is traditionally served in a conical paper or plastic cup with multiple flavors and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and/or adzuki bean paste at the bottom of the cup. Sweetened condensed milk drizzled over the top is sometimes called a \"snow cap\". This style of shave ice is common on the north shore of O'ahu, as well as on Maui and the Big Island of Hawai'i (where it is called \"Japanese style\").\n\nShave ice has its origins in Taiwan, as early as the 7th century AD.\n\nIt was imported to America by Japanese immigrants.

{"id": "7970298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7970298", "title": "Decidualization", "text": "Decidualization\n\nDecidualization is a process that results in significant changes to cells of the endometrium in preparation for, and during, pregnancy. This includes morphological and functional changes (the decidual reaction) to endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), the presence of decidual white blood cells (leukocytes), and vascular changes to maternal arteries. The sum of these changes results in the endometrium changing into a structure called the decidua. In humans, the decidua is shed during the third phase of birth.\n\nDecidualization plays an important role in promoting placenta formation between a mother and her fetus by mediating the invasiveness of trophoblast cells. It also triggers the production of cellular and molecular factors that result in structural changes, or remodeling, of maternal spiral arteries. Decidualization is required in some mammalian species where embryo implantation and trophoblast cell invasion of the endometrium occurs, also known as hemochorial placentation. This allows maternal blood to come into direct contact with the fetal chorion, a membrane between the fetal and maternal tissues, and allows for nutrient and gas exchange. However, decidualization-like reactions have also been observed in some species that don't display hemochorial placentation.\n\nIn humans, decidualization occurs after ovulation during the menstrual cycle. After implantation of the embryo, the decidua further develops to mediate the process of placentation. In the event no embryo is implanted, the decidualized endometrial lining is shed or, as is the case with species that follow the estrous cycle, absorbed. In menstruating species, decidualization is spontaneous and occurs as a result of maternal hormones. In non-menstruating species, decidualization is non-spontaneous, meaning it only happens after there external signals from an implanted embryo.\n\nAfter ovulation, the high levels of progesterone initiate the molecular changes leading to decidualization. The process triggers an influx of decidual leukocytes along with morphological and functional changes of ESCs. The changes in the ESCs result in the endometrium developing a secretory lining that produces a variety of proteins, cytokines, and growth factors. These secreted factors will regulate the invasiveness of trophoblast cells that eventually form the placental connection if an embryo implants into the decidua.\n\nOne of the identifying features of the decidua is the presence of large numbers of leukocytes that are mostly made up of specialized uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and some dendritic cells. As the fetus consists of both maternal and paternal DNA, the decidual leukocytes play a role in suppressing the immune response of the mother to prevent treating the fetus as genetically foreign. Outside of their immune functions, the uNK cells and dendritic cells also act as regulators of maternal spiral artery remodeling and ESC differentiation.\n\nESCs are the connective tissue cells of the endometrium that are fibroblastic in appearance. However, decidualization causes them to swell up and adopt an epithelial cell-like appearance due to the accumulation of glycogen and lipid droplets. Furthermore, they begin secreting cytokines, growth factors, and proteins like IGFBP1 and prolactin, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin and laminin. The increased production of these ECM proteins turns the endometrium into the dense structure known as the decidua, which produces factors that promote trophoblast attachment and inhibit overly aggressive invasion.\n\nThe decidual reaction is seen in very early pregnancy in the generalized area where the blastocyst contacts the endometrial decidua. It consists of an increase in secretory functions of the endometrium at the area of implantation, as well as a surrounding stroma that becomes edematous.\n\nThe decidual reaction occurs only in a few species such as humans. The decidual reaction and decidua are not required for implantation. Evidence can be taken from the fact that in ectopic pregnancy, implantation can occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity. Even after hysterectomy some women have become pregnant.\n\nAbnormalities in decidualization have been implicated in diseases such as endometriosis, in which impaired decidualization leads to ectopic uterine tissue growth. Lack of decidualization has also been linked to higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nChronic deciduitis, a chronic inflammation of the decidua, has been linked with premature birth.\n\nThe decidualization process is initiated by progesterone, but this requires cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to act as the initial signalling molecule to sensitize endometrial cells to progesterone. Consequently, human ESCs have been decidualized in culture with chemical analogs of cAMP and progesterone together. \"In vitro\" decidualization results in similar morphological changes to the human ESCs as well as upregulated production of decidualization markers such as IGFBP1 and prolactin.\n\nMouse models have been extensively used for the identification of the molecular factors required for and involved in decidualization.\n\n\n"}

At the time of his first introduction to the beautiful Vesper Lynd, he obtains her name in a perfect \"interrogation indirecte\", \"I was born in the evening..on a very stormy evening..,\" and asks to borrow it.\n\nA \"Vesper\" differs from Bond's usual cocktail of choice, the martini, in that it uses both gin and vodka, Kina Lillet instead of the usual dry vermouth, and a lemon peel instead of an olive. Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper, it is only ordered by Bond once throughout Fleming's novels – although Bond drinks the \"Vesper\" in the film \"Casino Royale\" – and by later books Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis, though he also drinks regular gin martinis. Felix Leiter ordered a Vesper for Bond in the novel \"Diamonds Are Forever\", albeit with Cresta Blanca in place of Kina Lillet, which Bond politely remarks is the \"Best Vermouth I ever tasted.\" It may be that Fleming decided not to have Bond order a Vesper again due to the way in which \"Casino Royale\" ends.\n\nIn actuality, the book version of the \"Vesper\" was created by Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce. In Bryce's copy of \"Casino Royale\" Fleming inscribed \"For Ivar, who mixed the first \"Vesper\" and said the good word.\" In his book \"You Only Live Once\", Bryce details that Fleming was first served a \"Vesper\", a drink of a frozen rum concoction with fruit and herbs, at evening drinks by the butler of an elderly couple in Jamaica, the Duncans, the butler commenting, \"'Vespers' are served.\" Vespers or evensong is the sixth of the seven canonical hours of the divine office and are observed at sunset, the 'violet hour', Bond's later chosen hour of fame for his martini \"Vesper\".\n\nHowever, the cocktail has been misrecorded after mishearing the name in several instances, resulting in its being alternatively named 'Vespa'.\n\nSince Gordon's Gin was reformulated in 1992 and Kina Lillet was reformulated in 1986, substitutes can be made that attempt to recapture the original flavour of the drink:\n\n\"Esquire\" printed the following update of the recipe in 2006:\n\nShake (if you must) with plenty of cracked ice. 3 oz Tanqueray gin, 1 oz 100-proof [50%] Stolichnaya vodka, oz Lillet Blanc, teaspoon (or less) quinine powder or, in desperation, 2 dashes of bitters. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and twist a large swatch of thin-cut lemon peel over the top.\nThe recipe concluded, \"Shoot somebody evil.\"\n\n\n\n"}

One can also find canned products labeled as kabayaki-style \"sanma\" (Pacific saury).\n\nKabayaki eel is very popular and a rich source of vitamins A and E, and omega-3 fatty acids. A popular custom from the Edo period calls for eating kabayaki during the summer to gain stamina, especially on a particular mid-summer day called , which can fall anywhere between July 18-August 8 each year.\n\nThe eel kabayaki is often served on top of a bowl (\"donburi\") of rice, and called \"unadon\", the fancier form of which is the \"unajū\", placed inside a tiered lacquered boxes called \"jūbako\". It is also torn up and mixed up evenly with rice to make , which is enjoyed especially in the Nagoya area.\n\nBroadly, two schools of cooking the kabayaki exist. In the Kantō region (eastern Japan), the eel is slit down its back and butterflied, so a lighter-colored stripe of the belly runs down the middle of each fillet on the skin side. The long eel is cut into shorter, squarer fillets and skewered. In Kanto, the skewered eel is first broiled, plain, into what is known as , then steamed, before being flavored and grilled again; as a result, it turns out more tender and flakier after grilling.\n\nIn the Kansai region (western Japan), the eel is slit down the belly and directly grilled without being steamed, often still in their original length, and called . The outer skin could be tough and chewy, so eel cooked in Kansai style may be placed between layers of hot rice, for the steam to help tenderize it.\n\nIn the Kansai area, the eel is often called \"mamushi\", just like the name of the common viper in Japan, \"Gloydius blomhoffii\"). Some speculate the name is a corruption of \"mabushi\" meaning \"besprinkle\", while others say it is a reference to the eel being rather similar to the viper in shape and vigor-endowing abilities when consumed.\n\nSeveral hypothesized origins for the name \"kabayaki\" are given. The name came to be generally written using the kanji 蒲焼 meaning cattail-broiled. Resemblance to the brown plush flower spikes of the cattail plant has been suggested as etymological origin in several old writings (; the writings of ; ). Food historian (1881–1958) has argued that originally the whole eel was brocheted vertically and cooked that way, giving rise to the name on the resemblance to the cattail both in form and color. This is incidentally the same as one hypothesized etymology for kamaboko.\n\nAnother touted theory explains the name as due to resemblance of the charred skin side to the (, .

The sound of the chakapa is said to comfort patients in an ayahuasca ceremony and \"cleans\" the energy surrounding the patient. Shaman have a large variety of chakapa movements that create different sounds and energy waves; these movements match the coinciding icaro and healing that is being done at the time.\n\nSome people report seeing green, blue, and gold ribbons of light form around the chakapa, and then move in tendrils about the room.\nThe chakapa is also an important cleansing tool used during \"venteadas\" and \"arcanas\". In the Amazon, once the shaman catches the bad spirits in a chakapa, it is then blown out of the leaves into the forest. The spirits are distributed and taken in by all nature such as trees and plants.\nA chakapa is made by tying together the leaves from the bush in a fashion that forms a fan shaped instrument. (See picture)\n\nThe Woodland Cree have a legend about a great hunter named Chakapas. The legend talks about how Chakapas trapped the moon so that it did not shine anymore. Since the brightness of the moon was gone, the Indians had problems with traveling between seasons because they could not see as easily. They begged Chakapas to let the moon go, but Chakapa could not get close enough to the moon to release it. He used the help of mice to set it free. A brave mouse chewed the cords that tied the moon. It left him burned which is the Indians explanation for mice having a light grey belly. The moon was eventually set free and the shadow of Chakapas remains on the moon to this day.\n"}

Taplejung is the ultimate destination for drinking Tongba. Offering Tongba is respect to a guest in Limbu people and also must-have drinks in occasions and festivals.\nTongba actually is the vessel which holds the fermented millet beverage known as mandokpenaa thee. Mandokpenaa thee is prepared by cooking and fermenting whole grain millet. The cooked millet is cooled and mixed with khesung (which is a source of molds, bacteria and yeast). Then the mass is collected and placed in a woven bamboo basket lined with green leaves or plastic, covered with thick fold of cloth and allowed to remain in a warm place for 1–2 days depending upon the temperature. The sweet mass is then packed tightly into an earthenware pot or plastic jars and the opening is usually sealed off to prevent air from entering. After 7–15 days also depending upon the temperature, the fermentation is complete and the mass is converted to mandokpenaa thee.\n\nThe time mandokpenaa thee is left to remain undisturbed in the pot after completion of fermentation leads to maturing of the mandokpenaa thee. During the maturing the flavours and taste intensifies yet become more mellowed. Traditionally, it is stored for about six months.\n\nIt is consumed in a unique way: the fermented millet is put in a container, also traditionally called a Tongba, and boiled water is poured in it to the brim. It is then left undisturbed for about five minutes. Once the five minutes has passed it is ready to drink. A fine bamboo straw with a blind end, but perforated on the side to act as a filter, is inserted into the container to suck out the warm water and alcohol from the millet grains. More hot water is added as the tongba becomes dry, and the process is repeated until the alcohol is exhausted.\n\n"}

These are held commonly in the colleges and halls of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Durham, St Andrews, Bristol, Leeds, London, Nottingham, the Australian sandstone universities (Adelaide, Melbourne, Queensland, Sydney, Tasmania, Western Australia), and Toronto. \n\nIn a number of red brick universities, some halls such as those at Bristol, Leeds and Exeter, also practise similar traditions in order to increase interaction between academics and students, and to enrich the students' overall learning experience. Colleges of some Australian red brick universities, including the Australian National University, Monash University, the University of New England, the University of New South Wales and the University of Southern Queensland, also hold gowned formal dinners. \n\nThe nature of Formals varies widely between the colleges and halls that hold them. In some colleges, Formals may be held every night, and are simply a second sitting of hall at which gowns are worn and grace is read. In other colleges, Formals may be special events to which guests from outside the college are frequently invited, often with themes and associated ents or \"bops\". In between these two extremes fall the great majority of colleges.\n\nThe full name and abbreviations to describe the formals differ. Generally, though, they are known as:\n\nAbbreviations of the above terms tend to be either \"Formal\" or, at St John's College, Cambridge, \"Hall\". There are other circumstances in which different names are used. For example, some larger colleges have both a large dining hall and a canteen-style dining room (often called the \"Buttery\" or \"Servery\"). In these cases informal evening meals are taken in the Buttery and formal meals in the hall, and the term Hall is used uniquely to refer to the latter meal. Some may call it \"Second Hall\" to differentiate from the earlier self-service \"First Hall\" or \"Informal Hall\".\n\nSome colleges/halls have elaborate traditions, while others are more relaxed. Grace may be said before the meal, in some places in Latin. A dress code of academic gowns at formals is compulsory at some colleges; in other cases formal wear (for example a lounge suit for men or equivalent for women) is required in addition to, or instead of, the gown. \n\nThe tradition of \"pennying\" is long established in most Cambridge, Oxford, St Andrews and Durham colleges/halls, although is banned in some colleges, such as Keble College, Oxford and Pembroke, Cambridge whereas in others there is often the risk of possible expulsion from the meal by staff members and even fines at St Chad's College, Durham. A variation of the tradition is found at University College, Durham, where corks are used instead of pennies. In some Cambridge colleges, Smarties are used as an alternative, due to the request of the kitchen staff (pennies apparently being a problem in dishwashers).\n\nAlmost all Bristol, Durham, St Andrews, Royal Holloway, Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge college formal halls include a High Table, exclusively for the Senior Common Room of the college and their guests, with students eating at the lower tables. The high table is often raised above the floor level of the hall, on a dais. Some of the newer colleges (e.g. Wolfson College, Cambridge, Wolfson College, Oxford, Linacre College, Oxford) have discontinued or have never had this practice, in order to promote equality between fellows and students.\n\nThere may be one or more after dinner speakers at the end of the dinner or even between courses on special occasions.\n\n"}

It was developed during colonial times in the Dutch East Indies. The firm-textured cake is an Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) version of the European multi-layered spit cake. However it is not baked on a rotating spit, and contains a mix of Indonesian spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, clove, mace and anise. The cake is made of flour and yolk and is rich in butter or margarine.\n\nSpekkoek is popular in Indonesia and is served as a holiday treat, especially for \"natal\", \"imlek\", and \"lebaran\". It is also served or given as gifts during many local festivities such as at birthday parties and weddings. In the Netherlands, the sliced cake is traditionally served for dessert in rijsttafel.\n\nThe Dutch term spekkoek translates literally as pork belly (or bacon) cake, a name derived from its appearance of dark and light layers. Its Indonesian name, lapis legit, means sweet layer cake. The English translation is often given as thousand layer cake, or thousand layer spice cake.\n\nAs a spekkoek commonly has more than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring a small amount of batter into a baking tin, which is then put into an oven and grilled from above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then removed from the oven and the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.\n\nWhere clove buds or cardamom seeds are difficult to find, bakers can use spekkoek powder as a replacement. Milling and mixing the spices right before baking produces a cake with an excellent aroma. The ground spices must be sieved into the flour at least three times as the spice powder is very fine and tends to clump in the batter. In Indonesia, there are many varieties of \"lapis legit\", including cakes containing almonds, cashew nuts, cheese, prunes or raisins, and even cakes flavoured with chocolate and pandan.\n\nDue to the effort required to bake the cake, it is a rather expensive delicacy, costing about €20 per kilogram in 2010 in the Netherlands. In Indonesia, a similar-sized \"lapis legit\" can cost up to Rp 400,000 (about €12.50).\n\nGenerally, a typical lapis legit cake is sold in a square pan (approx 20x20x6) and costs at least Rp 350,000 for a home-made, and up to Rp 900,000 for a special made (commercialised).\n\nIn Malang, East Java, kue lapis malang or spiku malang refers to a two-layered cake, prepared using a different technique. Two batter mixes are prepared, one with naturally produced yellow colour, the other mixed with cocoa powder to produce a dark brown colour. The batter mixes are poured into two different baking tin and baked in the oven. To assemble, the cake is layered on top of the other with a thin layer of fruit jam in between. Similarly in Surabaya, kue lapis surabaya or spiku surabaya refers to a three-layered cake, prepared using a similar technique to spiku malang.\n\nLapis legit is similar to traditional Indonesian \"kue lapis\", the difference being that lapis legit is a puffy layered cake, made of flour and is baked, while \"kue lapis\" is a moist layered pudding, made of rice flour and sago, and is steamed.\n\n"}

{"id": "8115727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8115727", "title": "Notre Dame Box", "text": "Notre Dame Box\n\nThe Notre Dame Box is a variation of the single-wing formation used in American football, with great success by Notre Dame in college football and the Green Bay Packers of the 1920s and 1930s in the NFL. Green Bay's coach, Curly Lambeau, learned the Notre Dame Box while playing for Knute Rockne in the late 1910s. Rockne learned it from Jesse Harper, who learned it from coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. It contained two tight ends, and 4 backs. The formation often featured an \"unbalanced line\" where the center (that is, the player who snapped the ball) was not strictly in the \"center\" of the line, but close to the weakside.\n\nPlayers line up in T formation then shift to a box formation. The Notre Dame Box differed from the traditional single-wing formation in that the line was balanced and the halfback who normally played the \"wing\" in the single-wing was brought in more tightly, with the option of shifting out to the wing. These two changes made the backs' formation resemble a square (hence \"box\") and made the formation less predictable, allowing offenses to run more easily to the \"weak\" side. Additionally, the halfback became a more viable runner than in the single-wing and the quarterback, normally just a blocking back in the single-wing, could become a passer since the center could snap the ball directly to him. The Notre Dame Box relied on a great deal of deception, caused by backs shifting frequently, rather than the pure power of the single-wing. Teams would often adopt the Notre Dame Box if they lacked a true \"triple threat\" tailback, necessary for effective single-wing use. Rockne's innovations with this formation involved using complicated backfield shifts and motion to confuse defenses, and adapting it as a passing formation. The formation was originally designed as a brute-force running formation, since it had 7 players to one side of the center and only 2 on the other.\n\nAlthough modern use of this offensive formation is largely defunct and exterminated among college and professional teams, several high school football teams across the United States have revived the Notre Dame Box offense and have been highly efficient and successful. Three notable high schools that successfully implemented the Notre Dame Box offense extensively are Western Harnett High School in Lillington, North Carolina, Nauset Regional High School in Eastham, Massachusetts, and Isabella High School in Maplesville, Alabama.\n\nThe Packers, using the Notre Dame Box almost exclusively, won three straight NFL titles from 1929–1931. From 1936 through 1945, Green Bay made use of the Notre Dame Box to exploit Don Hutson's receiving ability. Bringing the halfback in tight allowed Hutson to split out from the line, making him an even more potent threat. Hutson, impossible to cover one-on-one by any defensive back of his day, averaged a touchdown every five times he caught the ball, a mark that no receiver has rivaled in NFL history. Green Bay added three more championships employing the Notre Dame Box after 1933 (when official championship games began), beating the Boston Redskins 21-6 in 1936, defeating the New York Giants 27-0 in 1939, and beating the Giants again in 1944 by a score of 14-7. Green Bay tailbacks of those years were among the first NFL passers to post \"modern\" numbers. Arnie Herber was the first NFL player to pass for over 1,000 yards in 1936, throwing for 1239 yards and 11 touchdowns. Of that, 526 yards and 8 touchdowns were to Hutson. In 1939, Herber and Cecil Isbell combined for 1856 yards passing and 14 touchdowns. In 1941, Isbell broke Herber's single season record with 1470 yards passing and 15 touchdowns; he bettered his own marks in 1942 with 2021 yards passing and 24 touchdowns. 1942 was also the year Don Hutson shattered his own NFL records with 1211 yards receiving and 17 touchdowns, all in 11 games.\n\nThe Chicago Bears's and Clark Shaughnessy's Stanford Indians success with a modernized version of the T-formation in the 1940s eventually led to the demise of the Notre Dame Box, as well as all single-wing variants. The Packers finally switched to the T-formation, after Don Hutson had retired, in 1947. No major NCAA or NFL team has used this formation since and much of the knowledge (i.e. playbooks and, if it ever existed, film) associated with this formation is no longer available.\n\nUse of the Notre Dame Box in modern times has been limited in part due to changes in football rulebooks regarding motion. The frequent shifts in the backfield that are employed by the system are still legal, but teams must now set themselves in a formation for at least one second before snapping the ball or sending a player into \"motion\". This motion player must be moving backward or laterally. Canadian football never adopted these changes, and (even though it is not used in that variant of the sport) the original version of the system is still legal.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Western Harnett High School of Lillington, North Carolina was featured on ESPN after their program experienced a major turnaround credited to their employment of the Notre Dame Box. The head coach of that team, Travis Conner, later moved on to Jacksonville High School in nearby Jacksonville, North Carolina and installed the Notre Dame Box there, as well. He then moved onto Bunker Hill High School and completely transformed their football program, with the new system Bunker Hill produced 3 top 10 rushers with the leader being Reggie Davis who rushed for a single season near 2,000 yards.\n\nIn 2010, Keith Kenyon took over the head coaching duties of the Varsity Football team at Nauset Regional High School in Massachusetts. His single wing offense is largely based on the Notre Dame Box formation. Since his arrival, he has taken a downtrodden Nauset team to a playoff contender in his first 2 years. Nauset went 6-5 in 2010, 8-3 in 2011, and 9-2 in 2012 due to the success of the Notre Dame Box. Also during the 2011 season, Nauset played in the Atlantic Coast League Championship game on Thanksgiving Day against rival, and eventual undefeated D-II State Champion, Dennis-Yarmouth, for a chance to qualify for the playoffs. In 2012, Nauset once again played for the Atlantic Coast League Championship against Plymouth South. Nauset came into the game undefeated, but ultimately lost 13-12 on a last second hook-and-ladder pass, barely missing out on the MIAA State Playoffs for the second year in a row. Before coach Kenyon arrived at Nauset in 2010, the football team had a combined record of 5-46 since 2005, including back-to-back winless seasons in 2005 and 2006, and also a 27-game losing streak from 2004–2007. Kenyon's single wing Notre Dame Box undoubtedly turned around the Nauset football program and turned them into one of the most dangerous and prolific teams in Eastern Massachusetts.\n\nThe formation is very prevalent in the north of England, and is used by many teams in BUAFL due to the lack of talented passers as well at the unpredictable weather conditions.\n\n"}
{"id": "8116611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8116611", "title": "A formation", "text": "A formation\n\nIn American football, the A formation was a variation of the single-wing formation used with great success by the New York Giants of the 1930s and early 1940s. This formation was masterminded by Giants coach Steve Owen and relied heavily upon Hall of Fame center Mel Hein for its success.\n\nThe A formation differed from the traditional single-wing in that the quarterback played further back from the line and closer to the center. It also place the backfield opposite the \"strong\" side of the unbalanced line, providing more flexibility in the running game (though less power). The wingback is on the opposite side compared to the single-wing and the quarterback is the primary passer, rather than the tailback. The name of the formation was arbitrary, not from its slight resemblance to the letter \"A\", unlike formations named \"I\", \"T\", \"V\", and \"Y\" for the shapes formed by the backs' positioning; Owen labeled the standard single wing his team's \"B\" formation.\n\nOne major advantage of the A is the center could snap the ball to any of three players; typically to the fullback or blocking back for runs and the quarterback for passes. The fourth back, the wingback, became a crucial part of the system when Owen introduced a half-spin sweep series in 1938 which featured a wide sweep play to the motioning wingback, a dive inside by the deep fullback, and a bootleg threat away from sweep action by the quarterback. This triple-threat, highly deceptive series anticipated the Wing-T Buck Sweep series by well over a decade.\nA great center like Hein was a major asset, albeit not essential, in running the A formation — however only the Giants used this set-up with any frequency. This gave the Giants an advantage in that teams had to prepare specifically to defend the A whenever they played New York.\n\nCoach Owen experimented with the A from the early 1930s on. Mel Hein joined the Giants in 1931, but Owen didn't use the A full-time until 1937. The Giants, using the A, became the first team to win their second official NFL championship games when they defeated the Green Bay Packers 23-17, adding this 1938 title to their 1934 defeat of Chicago. Green Bay ran the Notre Dame Box, another unique single-wing variant. The 1938 win was the last time the A brought the Giants a title, however, as George Halas' modern T formation began to dominate professional football after 1940. Mel Hein retired after the 1945 season and proved difficult to replace. The Giants and their A formation were beaten for the NFL championship by the Chicago Bears and the T in 1941 and 1946. Owen finally installed the T formation as an additional offense in 1948, although the Giants continued to run the A through his retirement in 1954. No other team used the A formation in the NFL and the offense today is used only by some aficionados at and below high school varsity level. Ted Seay is known to many of them as a coach who decades later developed greater passing possibilities from the nearly forgotten A.\n\n"}

Fish cakes, boiled eggs, and scallions are some of the most commonly added ingredients. It can be seasoned with either spicy \"gochujang\" (chili paste) or non-spicy \"ganjang\" (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former being the most typical form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called \"gungjung-tteok-bokki\" (royal court \"tteok-bokki\"). Today, variations also include curry-\"tteok-bokki\", cream sauce-\"tteok-bokki\", \"jajang-tteok-bokki\", seafood-\"tteok-bokki\", \"galbi-tteok-bokki\" and so on. \"Tteok-bokki\" is commonly purchased and eaten at \"bunsikjip\" (snack bars) as well as \"pojangmacha\" (street stalls). There are also dedicated restaurants for \"tteok-bokki\", where it is referred to as \"jeugseog tteok-bokki\" (impromptu \"tteok-bokki)\".\n\nThe first record on \"tteok-bokki\" appears in \"Siuijeonseo\", a 19th century cookbook, where the dish was listed using the archaic spelling \"steokbokgi\" (). According to the book, \"tteok-bokki\" was known by various names including \"tteokjjim\" (steamed rice cakes), \"tteok-japchae\" (stir-fried rice cakes), and \"tteok-jeongol\" (rice cakes hot pot). The royal court version was made from white \"tteok\" (rice cakes), sirloin, sesame oil, soy sauce, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds, while the savory, soy sauce-based \"tteok-bokki\" was made in the head house of the Papyeong Yun clan, where good-quality soy sauce was brewed. In this version, short ribs among others was a common ingredient. The name \"tteok-bokki\" also appears in the revised and enlarged edition of \"Joseon Yori Jebeop\", where it is described as a soy sauce-based savory dish.\n\nIt is believed that red, spicy \"tteok-bokki\" with gochujang-based sauce first appeared in the 1950s. When Ma Bok Lim participated at the opening of a chinese restaurant, she dropped ttoek accidentally and ate it, and found that it was delicious. After that, she started to sell it at Sindang and it became \"tteok-bokki\" these days. Today, the typical tteok-bokki purchased and eaten at bunsikjip(snack bars) and pojangmacha (street stalls) are red and spicy, while the soy sauce-based, non-spicy version is referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (궁중떡볶이; \"royal court tteok-bokki\"). Rice tteok gained in as the South Korean economy developed, and various versions of the dish have proliferated there and around the world.As it was a folksy food for working class people, wheat tteok was often substituted for rice.\n\nLike other types of popular food, \"tteok-bokki\" went through various fusions. Boiled eggs and pan-fried \"mandu\"(dumplings) were traditionally added to \"tteok-bokki.\"\n\nIngredients such as seafood, short ribs, instant noodles, chewy noodles are also added to the dish.\n\nH\"aemul\"-\"tteok-bokki\", (해물떡볶이; \"seafood \"tteok-bokki\"\") uses seafood as a sub ingredient.\n\nG\"albi\"\"-tteok-bokki\" (갈비떡볶이; \"short ribs \"tteok-bokki\"\") is a tteok-bokki uses short ribs as an ingredient.\n\nR\"a-bokki\" (라볶이; \"instant noodles \"tteok-bokki\"\") and j\"jol\"\"-bokki\" (쫄볶이; \"chewy noodles \"tteok-bokki\"\"), are quite similar. They both add noodles to \"tteok-bokki\". ra-bokki and jjol-bokki differs from the kind of noodles added to tteok-bokki. ra-bokki adds ramyeon noodle, and jjol-bokki adds chewy noodles which are used to make jjol-myeon.\n\n\"Jeongol\" (hot pot)-type \"tteok-bokki\" is called jeukseok-tteok-bokki (; \"on-the-spot \"tteok-bokki\"\"), and is boiled on a table-top stove during the meal. A variety of add-ons, such as vegetables, \"mandu\" (dumplings), and \"ramyeon\" or \"udong\" noodles are available at \"jeukseok-tteok-bokki\" restaurants. As \"jeukseok-tteok-bokki\" is usually a meal rather than a snack; \"bokkeum-bap\" (fried rice) is also a common end-of-meal add-on.\n\nNon-soy sauce- or chili paste- based \"tteok-bokki\" saucse have also gained in popularity. There are some well-known variations. \n\nFirst it is curry-\"tteok-bokki\". Curry tteok-bokki is roasted by yellow Korean style curry. It uses curry powder which includes a lot of turmeric  component, which makes it healthier than other variations.\n\nSecond one is cream \"tteok-bokki\". Cream sauce \"tteok-bokki\" is made with the idea of cream pasta, or carbonara spaghetti. Cream sauce and bacon are used instead of \"gochujang\" and fish cake.\n\nAnother well known variation is \"jajang\"\"-tteok-bokki,\" which uses \"jajang\" sauce instead of red pepper paste.\n\nPiquant, red gochujang-based \"tteok-bokki\" is one of Koreans' favorite snacks. Both soupy gungmul-tteok-bokki (; \"soup \"tteok-bokki\"\") and dry gireum-tteok-bokki (; \"oil tteok-\"bokki\"\") are commonly enjoyed, while the former is considered as the prototype. In \"gungmul-tteok-bokki\", kelp-anchovy stock is often used to bring out the savory flavor. \"Gochutgaru\" (chili powder) is often added for additional heat and color, while \"mullyeot\" (rice syrup) helps with sweetness and consistency. \"Eomuk\" (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and diagonally sliced scallions are common additions to the dish. In \"gireum-tteok-bokki\", the mixture of \"gochutgaru\" (chili powder), soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil often replaces \"gochujang\" (chili paste). Soft \"tteok\" sticks are seasoned with the sauce mixture, then stir-fried in cooking oil with a handful of chopped scallions and served. Tongin Market in Jongno, Seoul is famous for \"gireum-tteok-bokki\".\n\nThere are also many variations in Gochujang tteok-bokki. For example there is perilla leaf tteok-bokki. original gochujang tteok-bokki and etc.\n\nSweet and savory, brown soy sauce-based \"tteok-bokki\" is often referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (; \"royal court \"tteok-bokki\"\"). Its history dates back to a royal court dish before the introduction of chili pepper, which happened in the Joseon era (17th & 18th Centuries). The earliest record of gungjung tteokbokki was that in the 1800s, a cookbook called \"\"Siuijeonseo\"\". Having a taste similar to \"japchae\" (stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables), it was enjoyed by the royals as a banchan and as a snack. Although traditional \"tteok-bokki\" was made with soup soy sauce, which is the traditional (and was the only) type of soy sauce in the pre-modern Korea, sweeter regular soy sauce has taken its place in modern times. Other traditional ingredients such as sirloin or short ribs, sesame oil, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds are still commonly used in modern \"gungjung-tteok-bokki\". Other ingredients such as mung bean sprouts, carrots, onions, dried Korean zucchini, garlic, and pyogo mushrooms are also used frequently. The dish is usually served with egg garnish.\n\n\"Gireum tteok-bokki (; \"oil tteok-bokki\")\" is a variety of \"tteok-bokki\" that is stirfried in oil and served with little sauce. This style is most famously found in Seoul's Tongin Market, where visitors can buy coins, which in turn can be used to purchase food from various vendors around the market. \n\n"}

The dish is made with rice and any available legume, such as kidney beans, pigeon peas (known as gungo peas), or cowpeas, the combination of grain and a legume forming a complete protein; compare rice and beans. Gungo peas are particularly associated with Christmas. The peas are boiled with pimento seeds (allspice) and garlic until tender. Salt, pepper, scotch bonnet, thyme, onion (usually spring onion), grated ginger and coconut milk are then added along with the rice and left to simmer until cooked. Variations of the recipe include the use of salt pork or beef instead of salt. This flavors the dish well and reduces the need for additional protein. Rice and peas, the classic Sunday lunch dish, is usually served with a stewed meat, such as chicken, beef, lamb or pork, or fish or seafood such as shrimp, crab or king fish.\n\nHoppin' John is a dish served in the Southern United States consisting of black-eyed peas (or field peas) and rice, with chopped onion and sliced bacon.\n"}

Emergency nurses are most frequently employed in hospital emergency departments (EDs), although they may also work in urgent care centers, sports arenas, and on medical transport aircraft and ground ambulances.\n\nIn addition to addressing these \"true emergencies,\" emergency nurses increasingly care for people who are unwilling or unable to get primary medical care elsewhere and come to emergency departments for help.\n\nBesides heart attacks, strokes, gunshot wounds and car accidents, emergency nurses also tend to patients with acute alcohol and/or drug intoxication, psychiatric and behavioral problems and those who have been raped.\n\nThey must be adept at working with patients of many different backgrounds, cultures, religions, ages and types of disabilities. Emergency nurses must also have a good working knowledge of the many legal issues impacting health care such as consent, handling of evidence, mandatory reporting of child and elder abuse and involuntary psychiatric holds.\n\nIn their role as patient educators, they must have a thorough knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology and psychology and be able to communicate effectively with patients and their families.\n\nAn emergency nurse is typically assigned to triage patients as they arrive in the emergency department and as such are the first professional patients see. Therefore, the emergency nurse must be skilled at rapid, accurate physical examination, early recognition of life-threatening conditions. In some cases, emergency nurses may order certain tests and medications following \"collaborative practice guidelines\" or \"standing orders\" set out by the hospital's emergency physician staff.\n\nThe Certified Emergency Nurse (CEN) designation is granted to a registered nurse who has demonstrated expertise in emergency nursing by passing a computer-administered examination given by the Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing (BCEN). The certification exam first became available in July 1980, was accredited by ABSNC in February 2002, and was reaccredited in 2007 and 2012. The certification is valid for four years, and can be renewed either by passing another examination, by completing 100 continuing education units (CEUs) in the specialty, or by completing an online 150 question \"open book exam.\"\n\nAs of 2015, the BCEN has designated over 30,500 active CENs in the United States and Canada. The CEN exam has 175 questions; 150 are used for testing purposes (25 are sample questions). The passing score is 70% and the candidate has three hours to take the exam. The test is administered internationally in Pearson Vue testing centers.\n\nThe Certified Pediatric Emergency Nurse (CPEN) designation is applied to a registered nurse who has demonstrated expertise in pediatric emergency nursing by passing a computer-administered examination given jointly by the Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing (BCEN) and the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB). The certification exam first became available on January 21, 2009, and was accredited by ABSNC in May 2015. The certification is valid for four years, and can be renewed either by passing another examination, by completing 100 contact hours (continuing education) in the specialty, or by completing 1,000 clinical practice hours and 40 contact hours in the specialty. The CPEN exam has 175 questions; 25 are unscored sample questions.\n\nAs of 2015, the BCEN and the PNCB have designated over 3,900 active CPENs. The CPEN exam has 175 questions; 150 are used for testing purposes (25 are sample questions). The passing score is 87% and the candidate has three hours to take the exam. The test is administered in AMP testing centers internationally.\n\nA specialist nurse will independently assess, diagnose, investigate, and treat a wide range of common accidents and injuries working autonomously without reference to medical staff. They primarily treat a wide range of musculoskeletal problems, skin problems and minor illnesses. They are trained in advanced nursing skills. Under the National Health Service grading system, ENPs are typically graded Band 6 or 7.\n\nAdditionally, some specialized nurses perform as [emergency care practitioner]s. They generally work in the pre-hospital setting dealing with a wide range of medical or emergency problems. Their primary function is to assess, diagnose and treat a patient in the home in an emergency setting.\n\nAn advanced practice nurse assesses, diagnoses, and treats a variety of common illnesses, injuries and disease processes in emergency care settings. ENPs are trained in advanced nursing and medical skills such as x-ray interpretation, ophthalmic slit lamp examination, suturing, local and regional anesthesia, abscess incision and drainage, advanced airway techniques, fracture reduction, and casting and splinting.\n\nAustralian nurse practitioners follow the clinical practice guidelines developed by the Victorian Emergency Nurse Practitioner Collaborative (VENPC), who have supported nurse practitioner development in Victoria. This includes attending to minor head injuries, burns, open wounds, joint pain (Haemophilia), blood and fluid exposure, PV bleeding, suspected UTI, abdominal pain, cellulitis and more.\n\nEmergency nursing is a demanding job and can be unpredictable. Emergency nurses need to have basic knowledge of most specialty areas, to be able to work under pressure, communicate effectively with many types of patients, collaborate with a variety of health care providers and prioritize the tasks that must be performed.\n\nIt can be quite draining both physically and mentally for many nurses. Australian emergency department treat over 7 million patients each year. They spend much of their time on their feet and ready for unexpected changes in patients' conditions as well as sudden influxes of patients to the emergency department. ED (emergency department) nurses may be exposed to traumatic situations such as heavy bleeding, dismemberment and even death.\n\nViolence is a growing challenge for many nurses in the ED. Emergency nurses too often receive both physical and verbal abuse from patients and visitors.\n\nEmergency nurses work in various places, many of which are understaffed as there are nursing shortages across Africa. There is also a shortage of doctors, leaving many tasks for nurses with limited guidelines or standards to deal with, and for many emergency nurses the scope of practice is quite undefined. Nurses may be forced to work outside their scope causing frustration and increasing the opportunities for occupational health hazards. It can be speculated that triage protocols are either lacking or not being followed. The limited basic knowledge and skill of emergency nursing included in undergraduate nurse training programs, and the limited number of nurse trainers, provide difficulty for many pending nurses to acquire the skills needed to work in emergency settings.\n\nAround the 1800s hospitals became more popular and there was a growth in emergency care. The first development of an emergency room was originally called \"The First Aid Room\". Originally, nurses only dressed wounds, applied eye ointments, treated minor burns with salves and bandages, and attended patients with minor illnesses like colds and sore throats. The rule of thumb was first in, first served, but there were many cases where some people were in more need of emergency care than others and as the situation became more intolerable, one of the greatest medical developments came into perspective: triage.\n\nFor centuries triage had been used in war but was not yet established in the emergency department. The first time triage was referred to during a non-disaster issue was at Yale, Newhaven Hospital, United States, in 1963, and since then has become developed and more defined.\n\n"}

Salt-rising bread is made from wheat flour; a starter consisting of either water or milk and corn, potatoes, or wheat; and minor ingredients such as salt and sugar.\n\nSalt in the name is a misnomer; the bread is not leavened by salt nor does it taste salty. One explanation for the name of the bread is that the starter was kept warm in a bed of heated salt. Another possible origin of the name is the use of salt to inhibit yeast growth and provide an environment more conducive for the microbes to grow, enhancing the distinct flavors which predominate over the more typical yeast flavors.\n\nCompared to a sourdough starter, salt-rising bread starter requires a shorter incubation period of 6–16 hours and a higher incubation temperature, ranging from . Salt-rising bread is denser, with a closer grain, than yeast-leavened bread, and has a distinctive taste and odor. The pungent odor of the fermenting starter has been described as similar to \"very ripe cheese\".\n\nThe exact origin of this bread is unknown, but evidence suggests that it was the pioneer women in early American states who discovered how to make bread this way. Commercial yeast was not available until the 1860s. Currently, the tradition of making salt-rising bread is kept alive by relatively few individuals and bakeries that tend to be clustered in the central to eastern United States. It is particularly popular in Kentucky, West Virginia, Western New York, and Western Pennsylvania.\n\nOne of the main rising agents, the bacterium \"Clostridium perfringens\", is a common cause of food poisoning and can cause enteritis necroticans (pig-bel disease) and gas gangrene. Although disease-causing strains of \"C. perfringens\" have been isolated from salt-rising breads, there is no indication of salt-rising bread having ever caused any human disease.

Hoyt in the late 19th century, when retailers would typically buy cereal (the most popular being cracked wheat, oatmeal, and cerealine) in barrel lots, and scoop it out to sell by the pound to customers. Hoyt, who'd found a distinctive process of preparing wheat for cereal, sold his cereal in boxes, offering consumers a sanitary appeal.\n\nHoyt advertised the cereal in newspapers as early as 1879 and sold the business six years later to Dr. Frank Fuller, a physician with an interest in nutrition, who had founded the Health Food Company. Fuller adapted Hoyt's method to his own process for preparing a wheat cereal, and moved manufacturing to Akron, Ohio, close to the wheat supply.\n\nA.R. Wendell bought Health Foods in 1903, and incorporated it as The Wheatena Company that year. In 1907, the company moved to a new plant, dubbed \"Wheatenaville\", in Rahway, New Jersey. By the mid-1920s, millions of boxes were sold each year.\nIn the early 1960s, the Kansas City, Missouri-based Uhlmann Company, owner of the Standard Milling Company, purchased both the Wheatena corporation and Highspire Flour Mills, which for several years had been supplying the 100% cracked wheat used in the cereal. Uhlmann moved Wheatena manufacturing to Highspire, Pennsylvania in October 1967. The company began leasing its flour-milling facilities to the agribusiness giant ConAgra Foods in early 1987, and sold the cereal manufacturing operation to American Home Food Products in April 1988. Uhlmann retained rights to the Wheatena brand until shortly after International Home Foods acquired American Home Foods in November 1996 and then bought the brand name from Uhlmann. International Home Foods was in turn acquired by ConAgra in August 2000.\n\nEntrepreneur William Stadtlander bought the brand and the Pennsylvania manufacturing plant on October 31, 2001, under the newly formed Homestat Farm, Ltd. of Dublin, Ohio, which as of 2006 manufactures Wheatena and fellow vintage cereals Maypo and Maltex.\n\nIn mid-2006, the state of California sued Homestat under California Proposition 65 (1986), which requires labeling for food containing acrylamide, a potential carcinogen created when starch is baked, roasted, fried or toasted, while Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations do not.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Wheatena sponsored \"Wheatenaville\" on NBC's Pacific network. The program debuted September 26, 1932. The cast included Tom Hutchinson, Roberta Hoyt, \"who is making her first radio appearance\", Elizabeth Mallory and Eddie Firestone, Jr., \"also radio novices\", Harold Peary, \"who is doing several parts\", Wilda Wilson Church, Bobbe Deane, and Bert Horton, with Nelson Case as announcer.\n\nWheatena sponsored 87 episodes of the thrice-weekly \"Popeye the Sailor\" radio program on NBC's Red Network, from its Tuesday, Sept.10, 1935, premiere through March 28, 1936. The product was integrated into the narrative as a source, in addition to spinach, of Popeye's superhuman strength. Announcer Kelvin Keech would sing, to composer Sammy Lerner's \"Popeye\" theme, \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man\". Wheatena reportedly paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week.\n\nAfter this initial run, the show was broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:15 – 7:30 p.m. on WABC (now WCBS-AM) from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937, for an additional 78 episodes. Once again, sung references to spinach were conspicuously absent. Now Popeye would sing, \"Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\".\n\nWheatena also sponsored the radio show \"Raising Junior\", and at least one edition of the promotional proto-comic book, \"Funnies on Parade\".\n\nIn the film \"Caddyshack\", assistant greenskeeper Carl Spackler mutters to the head greenskeeper (whose nationality is Scottish), \"I'll fill your bagpipes with Wheatena.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Down In The Dumps\" of the TV show \"Mama's Family\", Thelma is trying to save her neighborhood from being turned into the new location of the town dump. Speaking on the phone to a neighbor, Thelma exclaims, \"Don't you think that saving our homes is more important than your Wheatena getting cold???\"\n\nIn the episode \"The Young and the Restless\" of the TV show \"M*A*S*H\", Radar tries to coax a depressed Col. Potter out of bed by telling him that they are serving Wheatena in the mess tent. \"They've got Wheatena, and it's warm and everything. But you've got to hurry.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Operation Friendship\" of the TV show \"M*A*S*H\", speaking about going to breakfast, Hawkeye asks if there are \"any volunteers for this suicide mission?\" To which Colonel Potter responds, \"Not I. I'm going to dine alone in my tent. Mildred sent me some Wheatena.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Gone Quiet\" of the TV show \"The West Wing\", Joshua Lyman's assistant Donna Moss, describing a run-in with some visiting senior citizens, mentions that one of them poured Wheatena on her keyboard.\n\nIn a deleted scene from the episode \"The Chinese Woman\" of the TV show \"Seinfeld\", after hearing about his parents divorcing, George laments over a box of Wheatena, remarking how Estelle would make it for Frank every morning, but could never get it quite right, to which Jerry responds, \"Wheatena's tough.\"\n\n\"\"Nutrition Facts\" required by California's Proposition 65:\"\n\n\"\"Nutrition facts\" as they appear on a 2007 box:\"\n\nIngredients: toasted crushed whole wheat, wheat bran, wheat germ and calcium carbonate.\nServing size: 1/3 cup (dry)\nAmount per serving:\n\n\"\"Nutrition facts\" as they appear on 2006 box\"\n\nServing size: 1 cup (141 grams)\nAmount per serving\n% Daily Value, based on a 2000-calorie diet\n\n\n\n"}

Similar to but predating corn flakes, which appeared in 1898 and are first rolled and then toasted, cerealine is corn grits in the form of uncooked flakes. It was originally used by the brewing industry.\n\nMore popularly, Toasted Cerealine Flakes, colloquially called simply Cerealine, was also the brand name for raw-flake cereal made from grits by the Cerealine Manufacturing Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, and its successor concern, the American Hominy Company.\n\nCorn grits in the form of uncooked flakes, known as cerealine, was used for beer brewing as of at least the 19th century, with Aurora, Indiana's T. & J.W. Gaff & Co. distillery building the Cerealine Mill at 607 Jackson Street in Columbus, Indiana, in 1867. Their Cerealine Manufacturing Company moved to Indianapolis, Indiana sometime prior to 1898, though the Columbus mill's building remained extant and was restored in the late 20th or early 21st century for use as a cafeteria and conference center by the engine manufacturing corporation Cummins Inc. Prior to being annexed by Indianapolis in 1895, the settlement around what was then called the Cerealine Works was known as Cerealinetown.\nWhite-corn cerealine flakes as a breakfast cereal were invented, perhaps accidentally, by Columbus, Indiana, mill worker James Vannoy circa 1884 or 1887. Vannoy's 1902 obituary said he found through experimentation a way to run the milled grain through rollers so that it would come out \"in thin layers or flakes. He went to his employer, Joseph F. Gent, with the discovery. Gent rather disregarded the wonderful discovery and told Vannoy that he had better been tending to his duties. Later, Gent had the discovery patented, and it was not long until Cerealine was on the market and was being sold in large quantities.\"\n\nCerealine was well established as a breakfast food by at least 1897, when the Illinois Farmer's Institute annual report noted that, \"Some mills make hominy of white corn, roll it into broad, flat flakes, called cerealine, which are used here as a breakfast dish...\" By this time it had become one of the three most popular cereals of that time, along with cracked wheat and oatmeal. All three were typically sold by retailers who bought cereal in barrel lots and scooped it out to sell by the pound to customers. Toasted Cerealine Flakes was later sold in packages.\n\nIn 1902, the Cerealine Manufacturing Company was consolidated with Indianapolis Hominy Mills; the Hudmet Company, of Missouri and Indiana; the Pratt Cereal Mill, of Decatur, Illinois; the Hamburg Milling Company and the Shellabarger Mill and Elevator Company, also of Decatur; the M.M. Wright Company, of Danville, Illinois; the Miami Maize Company, of Toledo, Ohio; and the Purity Oats Company, of Iowa, to form the American Hominy Company, based in Indianapolis.\n\nA 1907 trade journal reported the company was reintroducing the cereal Toasted Cerealine Flakes, commenting that it would sound\n\n"}

{"id": "8236448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8236448", "title": "Strained yogurt", "text": "Strained yogurt\n\nStrained yogurt, Greek yogurt, yogurt cheese, or sack yoghurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than unstrained yogurt, while preserving yogurt's distinctive sour taste. Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\", though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine, Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid curdling at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as pectin, locust bean gum, starches or guar gum, listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the US allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference in yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the lactose, strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\". In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.\n\nThere are no standard regulations in the market to monitor or control the composition of concentrated yogurts. Carbohydrate, fat and protein contents in strained yogurts varied from 1–12, 0–20, and 3.3–11 grams per 100 grams, respectively. Concentrated yogurts contain higher final total solid content than regular yogurts, possibly prolonging shelf life compared to regular yogurts.\n\nIn the cuisines of many Iranian, Baloch, and Turkic peoples (e.g. in Azerbaijani, Afghan, Tatar, Tajik, Uzbek, and other Central Asian cuisines), a type of strained yogurt called \"chak(k)a\"\nor \"suzma\" (, , , , , )\nis consumed. It is obtained by draining qatiq, a local yogurt variety. By further drying it, one obtains qurut, a kind of dry fresh cheese. Strained yogurt in Balochistan is called \"Sheelanch\" and is a vital part of the nomadic diet. It is usually used for making dips served with dates, or served as a side dish. It is also dried and preserved for winter use.\n\nStrained yogurt is known as \"Labneh (Labna, Labni, Lebni)\" in the Levant, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under olive oil. Labneh is a popular mezze dish and sandwich ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from cow's milk has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of olive oil topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nBedouin also produce a dry, hard labneh (\"labaneh malboudeh\", similar to Central Asian qurut) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with khubz (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nIn Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and Syria, Labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip. It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to hummus, spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend za'atar.\n\nLabneh is also the main ingredient in jameed, which is in turn used in mansaf, the national dish of Jordan.\n\n\"Labaneh bil zayit\", \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or Arish) () is a type of cheese that originated in Egypt. Shanklish, a fermented cheese, is made from areesh cheese. Arish cheese is made from yogurt heated slowly until it curdles and separates, then placed in cheesecloth to drain. It is similar in taste to Ricotta. \nThe protein content of Areesh cheese is 17.6%.\n\nStrained yogurt in Iran is called \"mâst chekide\" and is usually used for making dips, or served as a side dish. \nIn Northern Iran, \"mâst chekide\" is a variety of kefir with a distinct sour taste. It is usually mixed with fresh herbs in a pesto-like purée called delal.\nYogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. Strained yogurt is used as dips and various appetizers with multitudes of ingredients: cucumbers, onions, shallots, fresh herbs (dill, spearmint, parsley, cilantro), spinach, walnuts, zereshk, garlic, etc. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, ‘’Mâst-o-Khiâr’’ with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, or ‘’Mâst-Musir’’ with wild shallots.\n\nIn Turkey, strained yogurt is known as \"süzme yoğurt\" (\"strained yogurt\") or \"kese yoğurdu\" (\"bag yogurt\"). Water is sometimes added to it in the preparation of cacık, when this is not eaten as a meze but consumed as a beverage. Strained yogurt is used in Turkish mezzes and dips such as haydari.\n\nIn Turkish markets, labne is also a popular dairy product but it is different from strained yogurt; it is yogurt-based creamy cheese without salt, and is used like mascarpone.\n\nIn Armenia, strained yogurt is called \"kamats matzoon\". Traditionally, it was produced for long-term preservation by draining matzoon in cloth sacks. Afterwards it was stored in leather sacks or clay pots for a month or more depending on the degree of salting.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, regular unstrained yogurt (\"curd\"), made from cow or water buffalo milk, is often sold in disposable clay bowls called kulhar. Kept for a couple of hours in its clay pot, some of the water evaporates through the unglazed clay's pores. It also cools the curd due to evaporation.\n\nBut true strained yogurt, \"chakka\", is made by draining the yogurt in a (preferably muslin) cloth. Shrikhand is a dish made with chakka, sugar, saffron, cardamom, pureed or diced fruit and nuts mixed in; it is often eaten with poori. It is particularly popular in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, where dairy producers market shrikhand in containers.\n\n\"Chakka\" is also eaten in Pashtun-dominated regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan with rice and meat dishes.\n\nIn Albania, strained yogurt is called \"salcë kosi\". After preparing yogurt from micro-cultured milk, it is drained in a cloth sack from few hours, to overnight. The water released from this process is called \"hir\" and can be used to preserve cheese or as a drink. Meanwhile the strained yogurt is used in many variation in the Albanian cuisine and is eaten either plain or with added elements such as dill, garlic, cucumber, nuts or olive oil.\n\nIn Bulgaria, where yogurt is considered to be an integral part of the national cuisine, strained yogurt is called \"tsedeno kiselo mlyako\" (), and is used in a variety of salads and dressings. Another similar product is \"katak\" (), which is often made from sheep or goat milk.\n\nA variety of strained yogurt called \"basa\" is a traditional variety of cheese from the region of Lika in Croatia. In the countries of the former Yugoslavia, strained yogurt made of cow's milk has become very popular in recent years. It is usually labeled \"grčki tip jogurta\" and eaten on its own as a snack or dessert.\n\nIn North Macedonia, it is known as \"pavlaka\" ().\n\nAs in Greece, strained yogurt is widely used in Cypriot cuisine both as an ingredient in recipes as well as on its own or as a supplement to a dish. In Cyprus, strained yogurt is usually made from sheep's milk.\n\nStrained yogurt () is used in Greek food mostly as the base for tzatziki dip and as a dessert, with honey, sour cherry syrup, or spoon sweets often served on top. A few savoury Greek dishes use strained yogurt. In Greece, strained yogurt, like yogurt in general, is traditionally made from sheep's milk. Fage International S.A. began straining cows milk yogurt for industrial production in Greece in 1975, which is when it launched its brand \"Total\".\n\nA type of strained yogurt named ymer is available. In contrast to the Greek and Turkish variety, only a minor amount of whey is drained off in the production process. Ymer is traditionally consumed with the addition of \"ymerdrys\" (lit.: ymer-sprinkle), a mixture of roasted bread crumbs of \"rugbrød\" rye bread mixed with brown sugar. Like other types of soured dairy products, ymer is often consumed at breakfast. Strained yogurt topped with muesli and maple syrup is often served at brunch in cafés in Denmark.\n\nStrained yogurt is known as \"hangop\", literally meaning 'hang up'. It is a traditional dessert. \"Hangop\" may also be made using buttermilk.\n\nIn the United Kingdom strained yogurt can only be marketed as \"Greek\" if made in Greece. Strained cows'-milk yogurt not made in Greece is typically sold as \"Greek style\" or \"Greek recipe\" for marketing reasons, typically at lower prices than yogurt made in Greece. Among \"Greek style\" yogurts there is no distinction between those thickened by straining and those thickened through additives.\n\nIn September 2012 Chobani UK Ltd. began to sell yogurt made in the United States as \"Greek yogurt\". FAGE, a company that manufactures yogurt in Greece and sells it in the UK, filed a passing-off claim against Chobani in the UK High Court, claiming that UK consumers understood \"Greek\" to refer to the country of origin (similar to \"Belgian beer\"); Chobani's position was that consumers understood \"Greek\" to refer to a preparation (similar to \"French toast\"). Both companies relied on surveys to prove their point; FAGE also relied on the previous industry practice of UK yogurt makers not to label their yogurt as \"Greek yogurt\". Ultimately Mr Justice Briggs found in favor of FAGE and granted an injunction preventing Chobani from using the name \"Greek yogurt\". In February 2014 this decision was upheld on appeal. Chobani later announced that it was reentering the UK market using a \"strained yogurt\" label but has not yet done so. Greece may now seek to protect \"Greek yogurt\" across the entire EU under protected designation of origin rules.\n\nStrained yogurt (often marketed as \"Greek yogurt\") has become popular in the United States and Canada, where it is often used as a lower-calorie substitute for sour cream or crème fraîche. Celebrity chef Graham Kerr became an early adopter of strained yogurt as an ingredient, frequently featuring it (and demonstrating how to strain plain yogurt through a coffee filter) on his eponymous 1990 cooking show, as frequently as he had featured clarified butter on \"The Galloping Gourmet\" in the late 1960s. In 2015, food market research firm Packaged Facts reported that Greek yogurt has a 50 percent share of the yogurt market in the United States.\n\n\"Greek yogurt\" brands in North America include Chobani, Dannon Oikos, FAGE, Olympus, Stonyfield organic Oikos, Yoplait, Cabot Creamery and Voskos. FAGE began importing its Greek products in 1998 and opened a domestic production plant in Johnstown, New York, in 2008. Chobani, based in New Berlin, New York, began marketing its Greek-style yogurt in 2007. The Voskos brand entered the US market in 2009 with imported Greek yogurt products at 10%, 2%, and 0% milkfat. Stonyfield Farms, owned by Groupe Danone, introduced Oikos Organic Greek Yogurt in 2007; Danone began marketing a non-organic Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt in 2011 and also produced a now discontinued blended Greek-style yogurt under the Activia Selects brand; Dannon Light & Fit Greek nonfat yogurt was introduced in 2012 and boasts being the lightest Greek yogurt with fruit, and Activia Greek yogurt was re-introduced in 2013. General Mills introduced a Greek-style yogurt under the Yoplait brand name in early 2010, which was discontinued and replaced by Yoplait Greek 100 in August 2012. Activia Greek yogurt was re-introduced in 2013, and in July 2012 took over US distribution and sales of Canadian Liberté’s Greek brands. In Canada, Yoplait was launched in January 2013, and is packaged with toppings.\n\nStrained yogurt is called \"jocoque seco\" in Mexico. It was popularised by local producers of Lebanese origin and is widely popular in the country.\n\nThe characteristic thick texture and high protein content are achieved through either or both of two processing steps. The milk may be concentrated by ultrafiltration to remove a portion of the water before addition of yogurt cultures. Alternatively, after culturing, the yogurt may be centrifuged or membrane-filtered to remove whey, in a process analogous to the traditional straining step. Brands described as \"strained\" yogurt, including Activia Greek, Chobani, Dannon Light & Fit Greek, Dannon Oikos, FAGE, Stonyfield Organic Oikos, Trader Joe's, and Yoplait have undergone the second process. Process details are highly guarded trade secrets. Other brands of Greek-style yogurt, including Yoplait and some store brands, are made by adding milk protein concentrate and thickeners to standard yogurt to boost the protein content and modify the texture.\n\nThe liquid resulting from straining yogurt is called \"acid whey\" and is composed of water, yogurt cultures, protein, a slight amount of lactose, and lactic acid. It is costly to dispose of. Farmers have used the whey to mix with animal feed and fertilizer. Using anaerobic digesters, it can be a source of methane that can be used to produce electricity.\n\n\n"}

They are often used in pasta salads with pesto, Carbonara or tomato-based sauces.\n\nRotini is most often made from refined (white) wheat flour, although varieties made from whole wheat flour, brown rice, or other grains are also available.\n\nThey are only called rotini in America, while the Italian name is .\n\nIn the US these may also be called colloquially \"Scroodle,\" \"Scroodle Noodles\", \"Skroodle\", \"Scroodle Macaroni\", or \"corkscrews\".\n\nThey come in several varieties, two of which are two and three vaned.<br>\nThe two vaned variety is a helical ribbon (top picture).\nThe three vaned variety has a Y shaped cross section giving the pasta a more rigid \"backbone\" (bottom picture).\n"}

Some other names for varieties of custard tarts in the Middle Ages were \"doucettes\" and \"darioles\". In 1399, the coronation banquet prepared for Henry IV included \"doucettys\".\n\nMedieval recipes generally included a shortcrust and puff pastry case filled with a mixture of cream, milk, or broth with eggs, sweeteners such as sugar or honey, and sometimes spices. Recipes existed as early as the fourteenth century that would still be recognisable as custard tarts today. Tarts could also be prepared with almond milk during times of fasting such as Lent, though this was rather expensive and would have been available only to the well-off. Often, savoury ingredients such as minced pork or beef marrow were also added (the combining of sweet and savoury ingredients was more common in medieval England), but unlike a modern quiche the custard filling itself was invariably sweet. In Portugal the tarts are dusted with cinnamon; in Britain nutmeg is often used.\n\nModern custard tarts are usually made from shortcrust pastry, eggs, sugar, milk or cream, and vanilla, sprinkled with nutmeg and baked. Unlike egg tarts, custard tarts are normally served at room temperature. They are available either as individual tarts, generally around across, or as larger tarts intended to be divided into slices.\n\nCustard tarts have long been a favourite pastry in Britain and the Commonwealth. They are often called egg custard tarts or simply egg custards to distinguish the egg-based filling from the commonly served cornflour-based custards. They are sold in supermarkets and bakeries throughout the UK.\n\nIn the UK, the custard tart is regarded as a classic British dish. A version by Marcus Wareing was selected on the BBC television programme \"Great British Menu\" as the final course of a banquet to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's 80th birthday.\n\nVariations on the classic recipe include the Manchester tart, where a layer of jam is spread on the pastry before the custard is added. Other versions may have some fresh fruit, such as rhubarb, cooked into the filling. Versions topped with elaborate arrangements of fruit show the influence of French pâtisserie.\n\nCustard tarts in France – where they are known as \"flans pâtissier\" – are generally shallower and larger than British ones, and therefore served in slices rather than as individual items. Their filling may contain fruit, making them similar to clafoutis.\n\n\n"}

The term does not appear frequently in modern Bible translations, but was the usual word for unleavened bread in the early Catholic English Douay-Rheims Bible.\n\nThe adjectival form Azymite was used as a term of abuse by Byzantine Rite Christians against Roman Rite Christians. The Orthodox Church has continued the ancient Eastern practice of using leavened bread for the Lamb (Host) in the Eucharist. After serious theological disputes between Rome and the churches of the East, Latin use of unleavened bread, \"azymes\", for the Eucharist—a point of liturgical difference—became also a point of theological difference between the two, and was one of several disputes which led eventually to the Great Schism between Eastern and Western Christianity in 1054.\n"}

The foam or scum (filleyo) is carefully removed while boiling and is later discarded.\n\nGarudiya is usually eaten with steamed rice, but it can also be eaten with \"roshi\", the Maldivian chapati. When eaten with boiled taro (\"Alocasia\" and \"Colocasia\"), or with boiled breadfruit, grated coconut is added.\n\nSometimes Maldivians use chilies, curry leaves and onions to flavor the garudiya according to their taste, however, mostly this broth is cooked simply using fish, salt and water.\n\n\"Kekki garudiya\" is a variant of garudiya with spices.\n\nGarudiya could be also obtained using other fishes like wahoo \"(kurumas)\", mahi-mahi \"(fiyala)\" or bluefin jack \"(handi)\", among others, but the favored fish for garudiya is tuna and related species.\n\nWhen the tuna-based garudiya is cooked until all the water evaporates, it forms a thick brown paste known as \"Rihaakuru\" that is highly valued in the Maldivian diet.\n\n"}

Hype Energy Drinks has been an official sponsor of Formula One racing team Force India since 2015.\n\nIn 2016 Hype Energy Drinks started their involvement within the video game industry by sponsoring European leading eSports organisation Epsilon eSports.\nNow, in 2018, following the rise of Formula One eSports Series Hype Energy Drinks became the official title sponsor of Sahara Force India’s F1 eSports Organisation, Hype Energy eForce India.\n\nHype Energy was first developed in 1993 by Ashley Roy, Nigel Spiro, and Andrew Barshall and backed by Hard Rock Cafe founder, Barry Cox. Under Spiro and Managing Director David Harris, Hype Energy became heavily involved in motorsport by first sponsoring the Arrows Formula One team and subsequently Benetton, Williams, a NASCAR outfit and several motorbike teams. Associated with the Formula One party lifestyle and with a strong presence in the paddock, Hype Energy committed to considerable amounts of sponsorship in an attempt to achieve global recognition and establish worldwide distribution. In 1997, having established a credible brand, Hype Corporation (the holding company) decided to pull back from the sport to focus on resolving manufacturing difficulties, which were restricting further growth.\n\nIn 1997, former Formula One racing driver and 24 Hours of Le Mans winner, Bertrand Gachot, signed a distribution agreement with Hype Energy in order to introduce the product to France. Gachot was one of a handful of distributors who remained committed to the brand and in 1998, he approached the Swiss licensor to buy the company holding the Hype Energy trademarks. In May 2000, after two years of negotiation, Gachot came to an agreement and restructured the company. Until 2000 Hype Energy had four products in its portfolio: Hype MFP with a strawberry and cranberry flavour, Hype Energy Morning Rush with a citrus flavour, Hype Passion Attack with passion fruit and Hype Night Boost with peach. In May 2000, the company launched a new version of Hype Energy into selected markets. The culmination of 18 months of development, Hype Energy now used fresh fruit juice, contained ten vitamins and had no artificial colours or preservatives, as it was pasteurized.\n\nThe improved Hype Energy product gave the company a substantial boost. It was first launched in France and the Persian Gulf, then the USA and Canada, and by 2001 it had achieved significant global growth. The brand is now present in more than 40 countries across the globe from the USA, Canada, Honduras and Panama to Africa and the Middle East. Hype Energy is manufactured in the USA, Canada and the Netherlands. It has offices in Spain, Dubai and Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nHype Energy MFP contains ingredients including taurine, carbonated water, sugar, caffeine and five B vitamins: Vit B2, Vit B3 (niacin), Vit B5, Vit B6 and Vit B12. Hype Energy MFP is free from artificial colours and preservatives. Other variations contain a mixture of vitamins and natural flavorings.\n\n\n\nHype Energy have a heavy involvement in Formula 1, this may be due to Hype Energy Owner, Bertrand Gachot, being a former Formula 1 driver. Hype Energy have been an official partner of the Formula 1 team Sahara Force India since 2015. Hype Energy provides drinks to Sahara Force India in every GP Race of the season and features branding on the drivers panels and the inside of rear wing endplate. In the last race of the 2016 season in Abu Dhabi, Hype Energy additionally featured logos on: the side pods of the VJM09, the front, back and cockpit sides of the car and on the chest of the drivers' suits.

In the medieval Islamic world, the word \"Bimaristan\" was used to indicate a hospital where the ill were welcomed and cared for by qualified staff.\n\nAs hospitals developed during the Islamic civilization, specific characteristics were attained. Bimaristans were secular. They served all people regardless of their race, religion, citizenship, or gender. The Waqf documents stated nobody was ever to be turned away. The ultimate goal of all physicians and hospital staff was to work together to help the well-being of their patients. There was no time limit a patient could spend as an inpatient; the Waqf documents stated the hospital was required to keep all patients until they were fully recovered. Men and women were admitted to separate but equally equipped wards. The separate wards were further divided into mental disease, contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and eye disease. Patients were attended to by same sex nurses and staff. Each hospital contained a lecture hall, kitchen, pharmacy, library, mosque and occasionally a chapel for Christian patients. Recreational materials and musicians were often employed to comfort and cheer patients up.\n\nThe hospital was not just a place to treat patients, it also served as a medical school to educate and train students. Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients and their medical treatment. Students were responsible in keeping these patient records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.\n\nDuring this era, physician licensure became mandatory in the Abbasid Caliphate. In 931 AD, Caliph Al-Muqtadir learned of the death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician's error. He immediately ordered his muhtasib Sinan ibn Thabit to examine and prevent doctors from practicing until they passed an examination. From this time on, licensing exams were required and only qualified physicians were allowed to practice medicine.\n\n\n"}

VapoRub is intended for use on the chest, back and throat for cough suppression or on muscles and joints for minor aches and pains. It has also been used to treat mosquito bites. Users of VapoRub often apply it immediately before sleep.\n\nFirst sold in 1905, VapoRub was originally manufactured by the family-owned company Richardson-Vicks, Inc., based in Greensboro, North Carolina. Richardson-Vicks was sold to Procter & Gamble in 1985 and is now known as Vicks. VapoRub is also manufactured and packaged in India and Mexico. In German-speaking countries (apart from Switzerland), it is sold under the name \"Wick VapoRub\". VapoRub continues to be Vicks's flagship product internationally, and the Vicks brand name is often used synonymously with the VapoRub product.\n\nAccording to Joe Schwarcz, the product can be traced to Jules Bengue, a French pharmacist, who created Ben-Gay, a menthol-based treatment for arthritis, gout and neuralgia. Lunsford Richardson, a pharmacist in Selma, North Carolina, sold Ben-Gay and heard from his customers that it cleared their sinuses. He blended menthol into petroleum jelly, at first calling it Richardson's Croup and Pneumonia Cure Salve, later changing the name to Vicks VapoRub. It was named after Richard's brother-in-law, Joshua Vick, a physician who had arranged for Richardson to have access to a laboratory to create the product. Richardson began selling it in 1905.\n\nVapoRub can be inhaled with hot steam. Since VapoRub ointment is an oil-based medication, it should not be used under or inside the nose or inside the mouth, and it should not be swallowed. Any oil-based product can get into the lungs if used improperly.\n\nIn pre-clinical animal studies, the application of Vicks VapoRub directly onto the tracheae of ferrets caused an increase in mucus production compared to a water-based lubricant.\n\nA Penn State study showed Vicks VapoRub to be more effective than placebo petroleum rub for helping cough and congestion with regards to helping children and adults sleep. However, the study also showed that, unlike with the petroleum rub placebo, Vicks VapoRub was associated with burning sensations to the skin (28%), nose (14%) and eyes (16%), with 5% of study participants reporting redness and rash when using the product. The study's first author is a paid consultant for Procter & Gamble, maker of VapoRub.\n\nA study conducted in 1994 suggests menthol and camphor are effective cough suppressants for guinea pigs. It has been suggested that thymol oil can reduce or cure onychomycosis (nail fungus), although the same source mentions that \"no human studies have been conducted to test whether thymol is a lasting and effective treatment\".\n\nThe ingredients, as listed on older product labels, are: camphor, menthol, spirits of turpentine, oil of eucalyptus, cedar leaf, nutmeg, and thymol, all \"in a specially balanced Vick formula\".\n\nActive Ingredients:\n\"Label reads: Active Ingredients (Purpose)\n\nRegular:\nLemon: \n\nInactive Ingredients\n\nRegular & Lemon: \nLemon:\n\nIn India, Vicks VapoRub is made by Procter & Gamble (P&G).

The name comes from the combination of the names of its ingredients: a grilled chorizo sausage and a crusty bread such as a \"marraqueta\", baguette or francés.\n\nThe Argentine \"choripán\" consists of a sausage made out of beef and pork, hot off the grill, split down the middle, and served on a roll. The \"chorizo\" may be used whole or cut in half lengthwise, in which case it is called a \"mariposa\" (butterfly). It is customary to add sauces on the bread, most likely \"chimichurri\".\n\n\"Choripanes\" are commonly served as an appetizer during the preparation of an \"asado\", but they are also very commonly sold at sport venues (particularly football games) and on the sides of roads and streets in major cities in Argentina. Taxi cab drivers in Buenos Aires are avid consumers and some street sellers can gather a long line of cabs during lunch time and afternoons when drivers get their lunch break.\n\nThere are several Brazilian versions of \"choripán\", the one most resembling the Argentinian version is called \"salsipão\", and made, in southern Brazil, with \"French bread\" (a Brazilian-style baguette-like small roll) and pork sausage. It is often served as an appetizer during the preparation of a \"churrasco\", or even as a substitute for barbecues, because \"salsipães\" are much cheaper, easier and quicker to make - so, they can be prepared on a short notice. Elsewhere in the country, there are many variations on the popular \"sanduíche de linguiça\" (literally \"sausage sandwich\"), most also made with \"Pão francês\" (lit. \"French bread\", a Brazilian baguette-like small roll) and pork sausage, but other breads and sausages can also be found. Possible additions to the basic recipe include melted cheese, \"requeijão\", sautéed onions, vinaigrette sauce, shoestring potatoes, mustard, hot sauce and many others. It is usually served as a casual meal, perhaps with a cold beer, very popularly on road-side dinners.\n\nIn Chile, \"choripanes\" are very popular, particularly consumed as a classic appetizer during \"asado\"s. Traditionally served in marraqueta and topped with aji and pebre, also mayonnaise is commonly used. Chilean \"choripanes\" are also made with longanizas instead of \"chorizos\".\n\nUsually sold in bakeries (\"\"panaderías\"\"), they consist of a Spanish-style \"chorizo\" such as \"chistorra\" or \"cantimpalo\", pickles and mayonnaise inside a typical home made Puerto Rican bread called \"pan de agua\". Other ingredients may be added, Manchego cheese and ketchup being popular ones.\n\nThe chorizo is sausage made of pork, may be used whole or cut in half lengthwise. Usually the sauce \"chimichurri\" is used as well as mayonnaise, sometimes Uruguayans tend to add tomatoes and lettuce. It's served in baguette or in \"pan catalán\" (sliced soft bread roll), except in football matches where is served in simple bread roll or bun (like hamburguers). Unlike in Argentina, chorizo is not only used as an appetizer but also as a garnish for the asado.\n\nIn the U.S., they are commonly available at lunch counters in Miami's Cuban diners and cafes, where the sandwich is customarily served on Cuban bread and topped with raw or fried onion and popularly eaten with a tropical fruit shake.\n\n \n"}

Two varieties of Newmarket Sausage are made branded with the names of two different family butchers. Both are sold widely throughout the United Kingdom. In October 2012 the Newmarket sausage was awarded Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin (PGI) status.\n\nThe three varieties of Newmarket Sausage are Musk's, Powters and Eric Tennant Butchers. The main difference between the three recipes is that Musk's uses bread as a filler while Powters and Tennants both use rusk.\n\nAll varieties have won several awards.\n\nPowters Sausages began in 1881 in what was a small butchery shop in Newmarket. Powters was originally started by the present owner Grant Powter's great-grandfather. During his time in the town, William Harper developed the recipe for what is now the Newmarket sausage. \n\nMusk's sausages originated in the small village of Stetchworth, three miles from Newmarket. Elizabeth Drake, the owner of a butcher's shop in Tea Kettle Lane was widowed in 1882 and, in 1884, remarried to butcher James Musk in Depford, Kent. She then began (or possibly continued) to sell the Musk's variety of sausages. These are believed to have been produced at Ivy House Farm where the Drakes were tenant pig farmers. Drake and Musk also had a shop in Market Row, Newmarket, from which they traded until moving to the High Street of Newmarket. James Musk died in 1905, a few months after opening the main shop on High Street, where the business traded until 1979. After his death, the business passed to James' stepson, Louis Frederick Drake (the Musks had no children), and later to his grandson Louis Gilbert Drake.\n\nMusk's sausages were favoured by royalty and Royal Warrants were issued to Musk's from George V in 1907, Prince Edward of Wales (later the Duke of Windsor) in 1929, Queen Elizabeth, later Queen Mother, in 1965, and Queen Elizabeth II in 2005. It is not known whether Elizabeth Drake created the Musk’s recipe and her new husband was the business influence to make it a success or whether James brought the idea back to Newmarket from Chiswick in London, where he had been working as a butcher in 1881.\n\nIn 2005, the European Union and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs tried to persuade the two companies to merge recipes and gain Protected Geographical Status, from which products such as Parma ham and Stilton cheese have benefited. It would mean their use of the Newmarket label would be protected to them for the sausage market, but it would also mean only one of the two recipes could exist. Faced with this problem, each party stands firmly by its own recipe, and neither wants to bow down nor merge recipes.\n\nIn November 2012, the Newmarket sausage received PGI recognition, all recipes co-existing as the European Union permitted the distinction between the recipes (including that of Eric Tennant Butcher's) and incorporated all the different ingredients listed in the application.\n\n\nJoshua Pennill 2018\n\n"}

The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.\n\nIn Italy, caffè americano could mean either espresso with hot water or filtered coffee (caffè all'americana).\n\nThe term \"Americano\" means \"American\", and derives from American Spanish, dating to the 1970s, or from Italy. The term \"caffè Americano\" specifically is Italian for \"American coffee\". There is a popular, but unconfirmed, belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy would dilute espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.\n\nEarlier, in his 1928 novel \",\" Somerset Maugham has his protagonist order and drink something called an \"americano\" in Naples during World War I, but there is not enough information to indicate whether it is the same drink.\n\nThe drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed with added water. Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30–470ml) of hot water is added to the double espresso.\n\nLong Black is an Australasian term for a drink similar to the Americano (in contrast to Short Black for espresso), with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding water to the cup first before pouring the espresso on top.\n\nThe term \"Italiano\" is sometimes used in the Western United States, meaning a short Americano, specifically a 1:1 espresso/water ratio.\n\nThe hot water can be drawn directly from the same espresso machine that is used to brew the espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same heater is convenient, particularly at home, not needing a separate heater, and the water can in fact be drawn directly into the glass, either before (for a Long Black) or after (for an Americano) pulling the shot of espresso. Some espresso machines have a separate hot water spout for this purpose, while others allow the use of the steam wand for dispensing hot water. Using a separate water heater is more practical in a commercial setting, as it reduces the demands on the espresso machine, both not disrupting the temperature of the brew water and allowing an inexpensive water heater to be used for hot water, rather than the substantially more complicated espresso machine.\nMost commonly, an Americano is used when one orders a brew-coffee sized drink from an espresso bar.\n\nAmericanos—particularly short, long-black-style Americanos—are also used within artisanal espresso preparation for beans that produce strong espresso. This is particularly used for single origin espresso, where many find that undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering; and with lighter coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as beans of Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation, generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to water is used, to prevent excess dilution, with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with existing water to minimize disruption to the crema.\n\nThe \"iced americano\" is made by combining espresso with cold water instead of hot water. A \"lungo\" is made by extracting an espresso shot for longer giving more volume, but also extracting some bitter flavours. A \"caffè crema\" is also made by extracting an espresso shot significantly longer than a lungo. A \"red eye\" is made with drip coffee instead of hot water, and may be called a shot in the dark.\n\n\n"}

Essentially the dish consists of varying amounts of minced beef, onions, carrots or other root vegetables, seasoning and stock. Some cooks add thickening agents such as flour, oatmeal or cornflour.\n\nDespite concerns that British people are no longer eating traditional dishes, mince and tatties remains popular in Scotland. A survey by the \"Scottish Daily Express\" in 2009 found that it was the most popular Scottish dish, with a third of respondents saying that they eat mince and tatties once a week. This placed it above other dishes such as smoked salmon, haggis, Scotch pies and Scotch broth. An annual competition is held in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, to determine the best mince and tatties.\n\nIn 2006, the European Union introduced new rules on meat processing which was reported by \"The Daily Mail\" as meaning the end of mince and tatties because of the limitations on resting meat for mincing. This resulted in Scottish National Party leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond announcing \"They can take our lives but they will never take our freedom to make mince and tatties. I am confident that, if some European commissioners were allowed to taste delicious mince and tatties, we would see off the threat to this dish. But we will fight them on the beaches and we will fight them in the butcher's shops to make sure we never have to surrender our mince and tatties.\"\n\nMince and tatties is well known for being used historically in school canteens, where the quality of the ingredients and the ability to feed a large number of children made it popular. However, this usage has meant that it is often looked down on. In recent years, there have been attempts by some to modernise the dish, which resulted in it appearing on \"Time Out\" magazine's list of the top 100 dishes available in London in 2012.

It is made from a large round of beef, stuffed with pork fat that has been rolled in a combination of saltpeter, salt, red pepper, brown sugar, allspice, and cloves. The round is then submerged in brine for up to six weeks, then boiled, and then simmered, with the blackened outer layer of beef and fat removed and cinnamon sprinkled over it before serving.\n\nA modified Rinderbraten called Spice Round or Spiced Round was once a common centerpiece of holiday meals in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Nashville was a hub of the meat-packing industry in the American south due to an influx of Swiss and German immigrants who founded several meat-packing companies along the Cumberland River, a major shipping route between the American north and south. One particular meat-packer was Mr. William Jacobs, who founded the Jacobs Packing Company in 1865.\n\nJacobs, originally from Wittenburg, Germany, only packed during the winter months due to local climate and the availability of meat from local stock beginning in September. Jacobs knew that Rinderbraten, a specialty of his native country, was prepared using a brine in order to preserve the meat through winter, so he began producing batches of it for the local populace as an easily stored convenience. In 1865, he was able to convince the posh Maxwell House Hotel to add it to their winter menu, and from there it gained in popularity, attracting other meat-packing companies to emulate his success.\n\nAt one time, there were over 30 butchers and meat-packers in Nashville, and nearly all of them produced Spice Round. Each used a slightly different and closely guarded recipe.\n\nNashville's version of Rinderbraten was not \"stuffed\" with pork fat; rather, it was larded throughout the meat with special horns. In addition to the fat being blended with the traditional Rinderbraten spice, typically the same spices would be used in the brining solution and run through the meat using specially prepared larding needles, leading to a much more heavily spiced preparation than the German version. Because of this, most Nashville families omitted the sprinkling of cinnamon over the cooked meat.\n\nIt is still available in some grocery stores in the city during the holiday season.\n\nJacobs packing Company was started in 1879 and was located on the Cumberalnd River near 2nd Ave N and Adams Street. In addition to being known for their spice round they were also well known for their hot dogs which they referred to as coneys.\n\n"}

This is then baked until golden brown on top.\n\nAn alternative from Aberdeenshire is called \"kailkenny\".\n\nIn January 2009, Gordon Brown submitted a recipe for rumbledethumps to a cookbook for Donaldson's School for the Deaf, describing it as his favourite food.\n\nChef Tom Kitchin cooked rumbledethumps as part of his Scottish menu in the fourth series of the BBC television programme \"Great British Menu\" in 2009.\n\n"}

Hutches are often seen in the form of desks, dining room, or kitchen furniture. It is frequently referred to by furniture aficionados as a hutch dresser.\n\nIn the 18th and early 19th century, however, the term hutch or hutch table referred to a tabletop set onto a base in such a way that when the table was not in use, the top pivoted to a vertical position and became the back of a chair or wider settee. This was a very useful form at a time when many homes had a large room used for multiple functions, because it allowed a large dining table to swing up and out of the way. \n\nTypically fashioned from timber, modern hutch dressers can range from country cottage style (frequently solid timber, sometimes adorned with ornate scrollwork) to the sleek lines of the wood grain veneer style popularised throughout the 1960s to 1980s.\n\nMany hutches from recent decades feature a mirror in the back of the upper shelving to give the additional appearance of depth and to better display the fineries kept within (in a similar manner to a china cabinet).\n\nAmongst the most desirable of the 1960s veneered kind are those featuring a fold down liquor compartment where the fold down compartment door serves to increase the worktop area for setting out the glassware and preparing a drink. These liquor compartments often feature a mirror at the back and frequently the inner wood veneer surface of the door (becoming the worktop surface) is polished to a high lustre, increasing the overall effect thus impressing guests and onlookers.\n\n"}

Farmers in the Mie Prefecture would raise smaller and more muscular, female cows to do agricultural work. When westerners introduced them to eating beef, farmers began to raise the cows to have traits that were more favorable for human consumption. The \"National Beef Exposition\" awarded Matsusaka with the medal of high honor in 1938. The award helped make Matsusaka more well known. The beef became famous for its marbling, rich flavor, and tenderness.\n\nThe cows take roughly three years to mature. In order for the meat to be sold under the Matsusaka name, it must meet strict standards. Only virgin female cows can be sold as Matsusaka beef and all calves must be of a breed registered by the Matsusaka Beef Management System. Most of the meat is sold through stores owned by the Matsusaka Beef Cattle Association. To prevent cheap meat from being sold under the Matsusaka name, all authentic stores have an \"Association Member's Certificate\". The Mie Prefecture Matsusaka Shokuniku Kosha public corporation implemented a system for tracking the cows to ensure authenticity. All cattle are given a 10-digit ID. The date of birth, location of birth, date it was slaughtered, shipping information, and the bloodline of each cow can be found by entering the ID on a website.\n\nWhile Matsusaka beef can be eaten as a steak, there are more traditional methods of cooking the meat. Shabu-shabu is prepared with very thin slices of meat which are quickly dipped in a kelp broth and then eaten. Sukiyaki is a method that involves simmering thin slices of meat in a pot with a sauce of sugar, sake and soy sauce. After the meat has been cooked, it is removed from the pot, dipped in a raw egg and eaten. The melting in your mouth sensation comes from the unsaturated fatty acids in the beef.\n\n"}

These are available both fresh and frozen in supermarkets, and are served by many restaurants, such as fast food restaurants like McDonald's, often as part of the breakfast menu. The term can also refer to a sort of potato pancake.\n\nAnother variant popular in the United Kingdom is prepared from cold mashed potatoes and fresh eggs. The two ingredients are combined, then fried until crisp on the outside.\n\nIn Australia and England, potato cakes in the form of thin slices of potato, battered and deep-fried, are commonly sold in fish and chip shops and takeaway food shops (milk bars). The terminology used in Australia differs from state to state. In Victoria, Tasmania, the south-eastern and Adelaide regions of South Australia, and the Riverina and the Murray River regions of New South Wales, they are referred to as \"potato cakes\". In the eastern and northern regions of New South Wales, Queensland, and the ACT the term \"potato scallops\", or simply \"scallops\" (and to avoid confusion, scallops eaten as seafood may be known as \"sea scallops\"). In the central and peninsula regions of South Australia and in New Zealand, \"potato fritter\" is most common, while in Western Australia and Northern Territory it is a mixed bag as to which term is used.\n\nPotato cakes originate from central England, but can also been found in northern England and Scotland. They are typically known by the name \"scallops\" in central England and \"fritters\" in the other areas and are common in fish and chip shops there. This variant is normally a thin slice of potato, dipped in batter and deep fried, with no additional flavouring added except salt and vinegar. This type of \"potato cake\" is also found in New Zealand fish and chip shops, however there it is referred to as a potato fritter, not scallop. More commonly in New Zealand, a potato cake is made from either mashed or grated potato and is not covered in batter or deep fried. Hash browns, which are also widely available, are distinctly different. In Scotland, what are known as potato cakes in Australia are known as potato fritters and are of the same type as the English variant. They are very common in fish and chip shops, and are often the cheapest item on the menu.\n\nThe term may refer to a preparation of mashed potatoes baked in the form of pie or a scallop made using potatoes or potato flour.\n\nIrish potato cakes are typically made from mashed potato, and either flour or baking soda, and are usually fried. This is not the same dish as boxty; boxty is made using raw potatoes, whereas potato cake is made using cooked potatoes. In Ireland, potato cakes are typically known as potato bread, or spud bread, and are served in traditional breakfasts along with soda bread and toast.\n\nScottish tattie scones and Lancashire potato cakes are made from mashed or reconstituted potato and flour, and baked on a griddle. They are typically served fried with breakfast, or as a snack with butter or margarine, although they are often served with other toppings such as baked beans, scrambled eggs, garlic butter, or tomato ketchup.\n\n"}
{"id": "8455187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8455187", "title": "Xian (Taoism)", "text": "Xian (Taoism)\n\nXian () is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable into English as:\n\n\"Xian\" semantically developed from meaning spiritual \"immortality; enlightenment\", to physical \"immortality; longevity\" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and tai chi, and eventually to legendary and figurative \"immortality\".\n\nVictor H. Mair describes the \"xian\" archetype as: \n\nThey are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as \"ṛṣi\" who possessed similar traits. (1994:376)\n\nAccording to the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, Chinese \"xian\" (仙) can mean \"rishi\" (Sanskrit: ऋषि IAST: ṛṣi), the inspired sage of the Vedas.\n\nThe most famous Chinese compound of \"xiān\" is \"Bāxiān\" (八仙 \"the Eight Immortals\"). Other common words include \"xiānrén\" (仙人 sennin in Japanese, \"immortal person; transcendent\", see \"Xiānrén Dòng\"), \"xiānrénzhăng\" (仙人掌 \"immortal's palm; cactus\"), \"xiānnǚ\" (仙女 \"immortal woman; female celestial; angel\"), and \"shénxiān\" (神仙 \"gods and immortals; divine immortal\"). Besides humans, \"xiān\" can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological \"húlijīng\" 狐狸精 (lit. \"fox spirit\") \"fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress\" has an alternate name of \"húxiān\" 狐仙 (lit. \"fox immortal\").\n\nThe etymology of \"xiān\" remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE \"Shiming\", a Chinese dictionary that provided word-pun \"etymologies\", defines \"xiān\" (仙) as \"to get old and not die,\" and explains it as someone who \"qiān\" (遷 \"moves into\") the mountains.\"\n\nEdward H. Schafer (1966:204) defined \"xian\" as \"transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)\" Schafer noted \"xian\" was cognate to \"xian\" 䙴 \"soar up\", \"qian\" 遷 \"remove\", and \"xianxian\" 僊僊 \"a flapping dance movement\"; and compared Chinese \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered man; \"xian\"\" with English peri \"a fairy or supernatural being in Persian mythology\" (Persian pari from \"par\" \"feather; wing\").\n\nTwo linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of \"xian\" involve Arabic and Sino-Tibetan languages. Wu and Davis (1935:224) suggested the source was \"jinn\", or \"jinni\" \"genie\" (from Arabic \"جني\" \"jinnī\"). \"The marvelous powers of the \"Hsien\" are so like those of the \"jinni\" of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, \"jinn\", may not be derived from the Chinese \"Hsien\".\" Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary (2007:527) suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between \"xiān\" (Old Chinese *\"san\" or *\"sen\") \"'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air\" and Tibetan \"gšen\" < \"g-syen\" \"shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air\".\n\nThe word \"xiān\" is written with three characters , , or , which combine the logographic \"radical\" \"rén\" (人 or 亻 \"person; human\") with two \"phonetic\" elements (see Chinese character classification). The oldest recorded \"xiān\" character 僊 has a \"xiān\" (\"rise up; ascend\") phonetic supposedly because immortals could \"ascend into the heavens\". (Compare \"qiān\" 遷 \"move; transfer; change\" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern \"xiān\" character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a \"shān\" (山 \"mountain\") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper (1993:164) interprets \"'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain.' The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature.\"\n\nThe \"Classic of Poetry\" (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as \"xiānxiān\" (僊僊 \"dance lightly; hop about; jump around\"), and rhymed with \"qiān\" (遷). \"But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering.\" (tr. James Legge) Needham and Wang (1956:134) suggest \"xian\" was cognate with \"wu\" 巫 \"shamanic\" dancing. Paper (1995:55) writes, \"the function of the term \"xian\" in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, \"to live for a long time\" has no etymological relation to \"xian\", it may be a later accretion.\"\n\nThe 121 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\", the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for ( \"name of an ancient immortal\"). It defines 僊 as \"live long and move away\" and 仚 as \"appearance of a person on a mountaintop\".\n\nThis section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe \"xian\" \"immortals; transcendents\". While the early \"Zhuangzi\", \"Chuci\", and \"Liezi\" texts allegorically used \"xian\" immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the \"Shenxian zhuan\" and \"Baopuzi\" took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity. On one the hand, \"neidan\" (內丹 \"internal alchemy\") techniques included \"taixi\" (胎息 \"embryo respiration\") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and Tao Yin exercises (which later evolved into Qigong and T'ai chi ch'uan). On the other hand, \"waidan\" (外丹 \"external alchemy\") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like inedia.\n\nThe earliest representations of Chinese immortals, dating from the Han Dynasty, portray them flying with feathery wings (the word \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered person\" later meant \"Daoist\") or riding dragons. In Chinese art, \"xian\" are often pictured with symbols of immortality including the dragon, crane, fox, white deer, pine tree, peach, and mushroom. \nBesides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of \"xian\". \"Xian\" (仙) occurs in the \"Chunqiu Fanlu\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Qian fu lun\", \"Fayan\", and \"Shenjian\"; \"xian\" (僊) occurs in the \"Caizhong langji\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Guanzi\", and \"Shenjian\".\n\nTwo circa 3rd century BCE \"Outer Chapters\" of the \"Zhuangzi\" (莊子 \"[Book of] Master Zhuang\") use the archaic character \"xian\" 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about \"Cloud Chief\" (雲 將)  and \"Big Concealment\" (鴻濛) that uses the \"Shijing\" compound \"xianxian\" (\"dance; jump\"):\nBig Concealment said, \"If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!\"<br>\"Then what should I do?\" said Cloud Chief.<br>\"Ah,\" said Big Concealment, \"you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!\"<br>\"Well, then—mind‑nourishment!\" said Big Concealment. \"You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves.\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!\" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11, tr. Burton Watson 1968:122-3)\n\nChapter 12 uses \"xian\" when mythical Emperor Yao describes a \"shengren\" (聖 人 \"sagely person\").\nThe true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12, tr. Watson 1968:130)\n\nWithout using the word \"xian\", several \"Zhuangzi\" passages employ \"xian\" imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE \"Inner Chapters\", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).\nLieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1, tr. Watson 1968:32) \n\nSecond is this description of a \"shenren\" (神人 \"divine person\").\nHe said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the Four Seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1, tr. Watson 1968:33) \n\nThe authors of the \"Zhuangzi\" had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complimentary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (\"changshengbulao\" 長生不老 \"live forever and never age\") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.\nChuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\" said Hui Tzu. \"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?\"\n\nChuang Tzu said, \"You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.\"<br>\"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18, tr. Watson 1968:191–2) \n\nAlan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.\nMany conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the \"Zhuangzi\". (1995:100) \n\nThe 3rd-2nd century BCE \"Chuci\" (楚辭 \"Lyrics of Chu\") anthology of poems uses \"xian\" 仙 once and \"xian\" 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist \"xian\" immortals Chi Song (赤松 \"Red Pine\", see Kohn 1993:142–4) and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under Shennong, the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of King Ling of Zhou (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen.\n\nThe \"\"Yuan You\"\" (遠遊 \"Far-off Journey\") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.\nMy spirit darted forth and did not return to me,<br>And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.<br>Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,<br>And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.<br>In emptiness and silence I found serenity;<br>In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.<br>I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:<br>I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.<br>I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,<br>And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.<br>They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,<br>Leaving a famous name that endures after them. (tr. Hawkes 1985:194) \n\nThe \"\"Xi shi\"\" (惜誓 \"Sorrow for Troth Betrayed\") resembles the \"\"Yuan You\"\", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. \"Though unoriginal in theme,\" says Hawkes (1985:239), \"its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive.\"\nWe gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad people<br>As we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.<br>In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:<br>There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.<br>The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:<br>I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.<br>In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,<br>Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.<br>But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,<br>Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning. (tr. Hawkes 1985:240) \n\nThe \"\"Ai shi ming\"\" (哀時命 \"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.\nFar and forlorn, with no hope of return:<br>Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.<br>Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;<br>Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.<br>I enter into friendship with Red Pine;<br>I join Wang Qiao as his companion.\nWe send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;<br>The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.<br>Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;<br>Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure. tr. Hawkes 1985:266) \n\nThe \"\"Li Sao\"\" (離騷 \"On Encountering Trouble\"), the most famous \"Chuci\" poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist \"xian\".\n\nSome other \"Chuci\" poems refer to immortals with synonyms of \"xian\". For instance, \"\"Shou zhi\"\" (守志 \"Maintaining Resolution), uses \"zhenren\" (真人 \"true person\", tr. \"Pure Ones\" above in \"\"Yuan You\"\"), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as \"zhen xianren\" (真仙人 \"true immortal person\").\nI visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,<br>Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,<br>Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,<br>Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,<br>Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,<br>Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life. (tr. Hawkes 1985:318) \n\nThe \"Liezi\" (列子 \"[Book of] Master Lie\"), which Louis Komjathy (2004:36) says \"was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)\", uses \"xian\" four times, always in the compound \"xiansheng\" (仙聖 \"immortal sage\").\n\nNearly half of Chapter 2 (\"The Yellow Emperor\") comes from the \"Zhuangzi\", including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).\nThe Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. (tr. Graham 1960:35) \n\nChapter 5 uses \"xiansheng\" three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers Tang (湯) of the Shang Dynasty and Ji (革) of the Xia Dynasty.\nT'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'<br>—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named \"The Entry to the Void\". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.<br>'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' (tr. Graham 1960:97–8) \n\nPenglai Mountain became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the elixir of life supposedly grew, and is known as Horai in Japanese legends. The first emperor Qin Shi Huang sent his court alchemist Xu Fu on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).\n\nHolmes Welch (1957:88–97) analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a \"hygiene school\" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and Five Elements philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of \"immortality\". This is what he concludes about \"xian\".\nIt is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word \"hsien\", or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the \"hsien\" in later times, nonetheless the \"hsien\" ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the \"natural\" powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a \"genre\" which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it. (Welch 1957:95) \n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals\") is a hagiography of \"xian\". Although it was traditionally attributed to Ge Hong (283–343 CE), Komjathy (2004:43) says, \"The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Shenxian zhuan\", there are four schools of immortality:\n\nQì (气—“energy”): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can\n\n\"...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.<br>But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation].\" (Campany 2002:21) \n\nFàn (饭—“Diet”): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the \"Sān Shī Fàn\" (三尸饭—“Three-Corpses food”)—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, leeks, and scallions) and grains. The \"Shenxian zhuan\" uses this story to illustrate the importance of \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\":\n\"During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of Qin Emperor Ziying. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']<br>The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent.\" (Campany 2002:22–23) \n\nFángzhōng Zhī Shù (房中之术—“Arts of the Bedchamber”): Sexual yoga. (Campany 2002:30–31) According to a discourse between the Yellow Emperor and the immortaless \"Sùnǚ\" (素女—“Plain Girl”), one of the three daughters of Hsi Wang Mu,\n\nThe \"White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress \"Toppest\") Manual\", a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,\n\nDān (丹—\"Alchemy\", literally \"Cinnabar\"): Elixir of Immortality.(Campany 2002:31)\n\nThe 4th century CE \"Baopuzi\" (抱朴子 \"[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity\"), which was written by Ge Hong, gives some highly detailed descriptions of \"xian\".\n\nThe text lists three classes of immortals:\n\n\nThese titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was Fei Changfang, who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution. (Campany 2002:52–60)\n\nGe Hong wrote in his book \"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\",\nThe [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death. (Hsi 2001:48) \n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 \"Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]\") is associated with Zhongli Quan (2nd century CE?) and Lü Dongbin (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called “Zhong-Lü” (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (\"neidan\"). Komjathy (2004:57) describes it as, \"Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods.\"\n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" lists five classes of immortals:\n\n\nThe \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of \"xian\" who exist between the world of devas (\"gods\") and that of human beings. This position, in Buddhist literature, is usually occupied by asuras (\"Titans\", \"antigods\"), but these beings are of another type. These \"xian\" are not considered true cultivators of \"samadhi\" (\"unification of mind\"), as their methods differ from the practice of \"dhyāna\" (\"meditation\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8477761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8477761", "title": "Hirabah", "text": "Hirabah\n\nḤirābah () is an Arabic word for “piracy”, or “unlawful warfare”. \"Hirabah\" comes from the root \"ḥrb\", which means “to become angry and enraged”. The noun \"ḥarb\" (حَرْب, pl. \"ḥurūb\" حُروب) means “war” and/or “enemy”. In Islamic law, \"ḥirabah\" is a legal category that comprises highway robbery (traditionally understood as robbery with violence or grand larceny, unlike theft, which has a different punishment), rape, and terrorism. \n\n\"Moharebeh\" (also spelled \"muharebeh\") is a term that is treated as interchangeable with \"ḥirabah\" in Arabic lexicons. The related term \"muḥārib\" (محارب) (perpetrator of \"muḥāribah\") has been translated by English language Iranian media as \"enemy of God\". In English-language media sources Moḥarebeh in Iran has been translated variously as \"waging war against God,\" \"war against God and the state,\" \"enmity against God.\" It is a capital crime in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nThe verse 33 of Surah al-Ma'ida of the Qur'an, which is known as \"the \"hirabah\" verse\" (\"ayat al-hiraba\"), specifies punishment for \"those who wage war against Allah and His Prophet and strive to spread disorder in the land\":\n\nThe punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter; \nThe verbal noun form (i.e. \"ḥirabah\") is frequently used in classical and modern books of Islamic jurisprudence, but neither the word ḥirabah nor the root verb ḥaraba occurs in the Quran. (\"Yuḥāribūn\" is the form used in Quran 5:33-4.)\n\nAccording to early Islamic sources, the verse was revealed after some members of the Urayna tribe feigned conversion to Islam in order to steal Muslims' possessions and killed a young shepherd sent to teach them about the faith. In view of the broad and strong language of the verse, however, various state representatives beginning with the Umayyads have asserted that it applied to rebels in general.\n\nThe original meanings of the root \"ḥrb\" are to despoil someones wealth or property, and also fighting or committing sinful act. The Quran \"refers to both meanings\" in verses 2:279 and 5:33-34.\n\nAccording to Islamic scholar Khaled Abou El Fadl, \"Hiraba\" in the Islamic context literally means \"waging war against society\" and in Islamic jurisprudence traditionally referred to acts such as killing noncombatants (\"the resident and wayfarer\"), \"assassinations, setting fires, or poisoning water wells,\" crimes \"so serious and repugnant\" that their perpetrators were \"not to be given quarter or sanctuary anywhere.\" Another source (Brian Murphy) states, \"many Islamic scholars interpret the references to acts that defy universal codes such as intentionally killing civilians during warfare or causing random destruction.\" According to author Sadakat Kadri, \"Most classical jurists\" had established \"a thousand or so years ago\" that Hiraba \"referred specifically to banditry in open country: a uniquely destabilizing threat to civil order in a premodern society.\" The crime is sometimes lumped together with \"fasād fi-l-ʾarḍ\" (spreading corruption in the land), which is mentioned alongside waging \"war against Allah and His Prophet\" in 5:33-34.\n\nThe inclusion of rape within the purview of \"hirabah\" has had support throughout Islamic history.\n\nThe medieval Zahiri jurist Ibn Hazm defined \"hirabah\" as,\n\n‘One who puts people in fear on the road, whether or not with a weapon, at night or day, in urban areas or in open spaces, in the palace of a caliph or a mosque, with or without accomplices, in the desert or in the village, in a large or small city, with one or more people… making people fear that they’ll be killed, or have money taken, or be raped (hatk al ‘arad)… whether the attackers are one or many.'\n\nIt had significant support from the Maliki jurists.\n\nAl-Dasuqi, for example, a Maliki jurist, held that if a person forced a woman to have sex, his actions would be deemed committing \"hiraba\".\n\nIn addition, the Maliki judge Ibn 'Arabi, relates a story in which a group was attacked and a woman in their party raped. Responding to the argument that the crime did not constitute \"hiraba\" because no money was taken and no weapons used, Ibn 'Arabi replied indignantly that \"\"hirabah\" with the private parts\" is much worse than \"hiraba\" involving the taking of money, and that anyone would rather be subjected to the latter than the former.\n\nIn the Hanafi school of law, the term \"zina\" is taken to refer to illegal sexual intercourse where rape is distinguished as \"zina bil jabr\" to indicate its forced and non-consensual nature whereas fornication and adultery fit \"zina bil ridha\", which indicates consent. Though the terminology uses the term \"zina\", nonetheless, they are two categorically different crimes as rape is treated as a \"tazeer\" (discretionary) crime by the judge and prosecuted based on circumstantial evidence (medical evidence, any number of witnesses, and other forensic evidence). In other words, very similar to how it is treated in contemporary Western law. It is fornication and adultery by mutual consent, or \"zina bil ridha\", which retain their classical \"hadd\" punishments from the Qur'an and sunnah provided there are four witnesses (absent which they too default to \"tazeer\", subject to discretionary punishments such as fining, imprisonment, or lashes). Nonetheless, gang rape or public rape, such as the sort that occurs during war, is still traditionally considered \"hirabah\" as that is more in line with its classical definition as a war crime or crime against civilization and society.\n\nIn keeping with the Quranic verse 5:33 quoted above, \"most classical [Islamic] jurists\" held that the penalty for \"muḥāribah\" was crucifixion (تصليب), cross-amputation (amputation of right hand and left foot) or being banished from the earth (نفى).\n\nAccording to Sadakat Kadri the crimes of waging `war against God and His apostle` (Muḥāribah) and spreading `disorder in the land` (\"fasad fi-l-ard\") were originally punished either by exile or some combination of double amputation, beheading, and crucifixion (what Kadri calls \"islam's equivalent of the hanging, drawing and quartering that medieval Europeans inflicted on traitors\"). This was the only capital penalty permitted rulers by the Quran (in the case of murder the killer's fate was in the hands of the victim's next of kin not the judge during the early years of Islam \"when enemies of the faith and political rebels often looked frighteningly similar\" the crime had broader application including apostasy from Islam but was \"gradually narrowed\" to apply only to \"highway robbery in the open county.\"\n\nThe choice of crucifixion and its method is subject to \"complex and contested rules\" in classical jurisprudence. Most scholars required crucifixion for highway robbery combined with murder, while others allowed execution by other methods. The main methods of crucifixion are:\n\n\nMost scholars limit the period of crucifixion to three days.\n\nRobert D. Crane, a Muslim lawyer who works for the Center for Understanding Islam, has suggested the use of the neologism \"hirabah\" to replace \"jihad\" when referring to Islamic terrorism. Crane, who asserts that \"There is no such thing as Islamic terrorism\", argues that to use \"jihad\" in English is to mirror the language of those terrorists, while the word \"hirabah\" uses the same religious vocabulary to stigmatize them. \"Jihad\" is a broad concept that literally means \"struggle\", while the root word of the neologism, \"hariba\", means \"to become angry and enraged\" and is associated with the demonization of non-Muslims during the Crusades.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia Hirabah is defined as \"Armed Robbery\". \"To prove hirabah, two witnesses must testify or there must be a confession. In addition, an offender can still escape the death\npenalty if he \"repents before he is arrested and willingly places himself in the hands of the authorities.\" \nThe penalty for hirabah in Nigeria is death if a life is taken during the offense. Additionally, the Zamfara penal code (in effect in the North of Nigeria) provides that if life and property are taken during the commission of hirabah, the penalty is crucifixion. \nIn Iran, hiraba is known as \"moharebeh\" and is translated variously in English-language media as \"waging war against God,\" \"war against God and the state,\" \"enmity against God.\"\n\nThe term is widely used by Iran's Islamic Judiciary, citing Sharia law, and is \"usually used against those who take up arms against the state,\" and usually carries the death penalty. The term is used in articles 183 to 196 of Iran's criminal law. The cases that fall under this term typically require involvement in armed criminal activities, e.g: taking up arms for terrorism and disruption of public safety (article 183), membership in groups conducting armed uprising (article 186), supporting groups planning to overthrow the government by force using weapons and explosives (article 187), accepting critical posts a Coup d'etat government. Articles 190-191 state that judge can give a person convicted under one of these crimes capital punishment. Peaceful and unarmed opposition to government does not fall under this term. Typical convicts under the term are members of armed ethnic separatist groups, members of armed drug trafficking groups, and people involved in armed robbery. \n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, \"at least nine people\" convicted of moharebeh by Islamic Revolutionary Courts for \"their alleged ties to armed opposition groups\" were executed in 2014. \n\nBetween the end of early days of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when scores of former officials of the Shah and others were arrested and executed for moharebeh, and the beginning of the 2009 election protests, executions for moharebeh were rare, and usually applied against members of armed opposition/terrorist groups, Kurdish separatists, or common criminals. \n\nIn recent years, Iranians executed after being charged with Moharebeh include Mohammad-Reza Ali-Zamani (2010), Arash Rahmanipour (2010), and Ehsan Fatahian (2009). Others accused, charged or convicted of Moharebeh include Adnan Hassanpour, whose death sentence for Moharebeh was overturned in 2008 on appeal, and Zeynab Jalalian, whose death sentence was commuted to life in prison. Shia cleric Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, known for preaching that religion is separate from politics, was reportedly charged with Moharebeh in 2007 by Iran's Special Court for the Clergy, but had his sentence reduced to 11 years in prison after an appeal.\nStudent demonstrator Mohammad Amin Valian was sentenced to death for Moharebeh in 2009, a sentence overturned by an appeals court in March 2010. In March 2010, the 76-year-old former dean of Tehran University, Mohammad Maleki, was charged with it for alleged \"contact with unspecified foreign groups and working to undermine the Islamic system.\" He was later convicted of lesser charges. Abdolreza Ghanbari, a university lecturer living in Pakdasht, was arrested in the wake of 2009 Ashura protests and convicted in 2010 of “Moharebeh through ties with hostile groups [against] the regime”. A request for pardon of the death sentence was rejected on February 28, 2012. \n\nIn a February 2011 televised address before a group of clerics in the city of Qom, hard-liner cleric Ahmad Khatami accused reformist presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi of Moharebeh as \"leaders of sedition.\" This was not followed up with any charges against the two by the Iranian judiciary. \n\nAbdolfattah Soltani, an Iranian attorney and member of Center for Defense of Human Rights has argued that under Articles 86 and 89 of the Islamic Punitive Laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the accused must \"either have engaged in armed confrontation or he must have been a supporter or a member of an armed group and must have committed effective [deliberate] actions on behalf of that organization.\", conditions that have not been met by defendants such as Valian, who threw stones at militia members. \n\nAccording to at least one journalist (Brian Murphy), the Iranian Islamic regime's use of moharebeh against 2009 election protesters has \"opened deep rifts between ruling clerics and Islamic scholars questioning how an idea about safeguarding Muslims can be transformed into a tool to punish political protesters.\" Ayatollah Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad has reportedly sought to \"rally clerics to oppose the use of moharebeh charges against political protesters.\"\n\n\n"}

It is the highest selling beer in Madagascar and has been described as emblematic of the country. THB is sold nationwide and since 2005 has been exported to such markets as France, Reunion Island, Comoros and Mayotte. The Malagasy beer is produced at two breweries in Madagascar, the first centrally located in Antsirabe and the other in the northern city of Antsiranana. THB Pilsener, the most common variant of THB, has a light taste and is produced from mostly local barley, corn and hops. Star Breweries also produces THB Fresh (a shandy with less than 1% alcohol), THB Special (6.2% alcohol), and THB Lite (1% alcohol). Recent investments in Star Brewery infrastructure have allowed a 20% increase in production since 2011.\n\nAfter advertising alcohol in the media was banned under former President Marc Ravalomanana, Star Breweries has increasingly promoted THB through unconventional means. These have included sponsoring the THB Champions League, Madagascar's national football championship, and holding annual beer festivals. In addition, THB is a regular sponsor of local musicians through major annual festivals and tours. Star Breweries has also hired musicians to perform in music videos specifically created to promote the beer. In 2014 the THB label was significantly redesigned, and in 2015 a new slogan, \"THB eo foana e!\" (\"THB always!\") was promoted alongside the beer's longstanding trademark \"Soa Ny Fiarahantsika\" (\"The Pleasure of Being Together\"). The beer is regularly promoted by Malagasy musical stars and other public figures.\n\nIn 1953 the French company Rochefortaise launched \"Société Tananarivienne d’Articles Réfrigérés (STAR)\" (Antananarivo Company of Refrigerated Products) and its associated factory in Antananarivo, Madagascar, for the exclusive production and distribution of Coca-Cola in Madagascar. In 1957, a brewer was recruited to develop a local beer. After developing 17 different recipes, he travelled throughout the island to test each one using primarily local ingredient; the best of these was a pilsener chosen as the recipe to be produced at a Star brewery to be established in Antsirabe. The company first began producing Three Horses Beer (THB) in 1958.\n\nIn 1968 Star Breweries opened a factory in Antsiranana for the production and distribution of THB as well as Coca-Cola and other carbonated beverages throughout the island's northern region. In 1980, Star Breweries became partly state owned; in 1989 Rochefortaise sold Star Breweries to Groupe Fraise, and the company obtained fully privatized status one year later. In 2005, the production of THB in cans began at the Star brewery in Antsirabe. In 2011 Groupe Fraise sold Star Breweries to French brewer Castel.\n\nIn the Malagasy market, THB Pilsener remains the most popular Malagasy brand of beer, and the most popular of any brand of beer sold in Madagascar. It is estimated that four liters per person are sold each year in Madagascar. THB has been described as an \"emblem\" of the country and a \"national symbol\". One Malagasy journalist described THB as symbolic of \"Fihavanana Malagasy\", a cultural value that emphasizes the importance of brotherhood and friendship.\n\nTHB won its first international award in 1980 with a gold medal, at the International Beverage Competitions, in Vienna. \nThen later in 2004, came another gold medal at the Monde Sélection de Bruxelles (International Beverage Competition in Brussels, Belgium). \nIn 2010, THB Pilsener was again recognized at this event, receiving the silver medal. THB Pilsener won a gold medal at the same competition in 2012, and the silver medal in 2015. THB Fresh also won a gold medal at the Monde Sélection de Bruxelles in 2012.\nMore recently, THB Pilsner won another gold medal in 2016 at the \"Monde Selection de Bruxelles\".\n\nTHB Pilsener, the oldest and most popular THB beer, is a 5.4% abv pale lager light in color with a medium body, thin head and balanced, mildly bitter flavor. THB Pilsener is sold in two sizes of returnable brown bottles: and . The pilsener is also sold in and aluminum cans, and has been available on tap at commercial establishments in Madagascar since 2006. Star Breweries also produces THB Fresh, a shandy (locally called \"panaché\"), with less than 1% alcohol. It is only sold in glass bottles. The original Fresh shandy, which has a lemon taste, has also temporarily been offered in several other flavors, including mint, raspberry and apple. Other variants include THB Special, with 6.2% alcohol, and THB Lite, a low alcohol beer (1%).\n\nTHB is produced in two breweries in Madagascar: the original brewery, located in Antsirabe, and a second in Antsiranana. Since its inception, THB has been sold in glass bottles tinted brown to protect the contents from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The Antsirabe factory produces 100 million bottles and 100,000 cans of THB per year. Antsirabe was selected for the original brewery because the water there is low in calcium and other minerals, lending itself well to beer production. Ingredients for the production of THB are sourced throughout the island. Barley grown in nearby Betafo and Fianarantsoa is blended with corn and hops from Toliara to produce the beer. Over 2,500 tonnes of malt and 3,500 tonnes of corn are grown annually in the surrounding Vakinankaratra region for the production of THB. The MALTO collective of 7,000 farmers was formed around 1980 in Antsirabe to grow barley and transform it into malt for Star Breweries beer production. Certain special malts are used to produce variants on the original THB recipe, such as THB Special.\n\nFermentation of THB beer requires approximately eight hours for each mash of 130 hectoliters. The mash is a blend of malt (sprouted barley) and corn in an 80/20 ratio to which water and hops are added. The mash is heated in a vat for around two hours to support fermentation. The product is filtered and then heated to 100 degrees Celsius to concentrate and sterilize it. The beer is then decanted and cooled for an hour at 10 degrees Celsius. Finally, a type of mushroom is added as a leavening and fermenting agent; the beer is allowed to ferment for a full week, and excess carbon dioxide produced by the process is collected for the production of soft drinks and other carbonated beverages at the factory. The beer is allowed to rest in vats for several more days before being filtered once more and then bottled and pasteurized at 62 degrees Celsius for three minutes. The automated bottling process yields crates of THB that are ready for shipment to regional wholesale distribution points.\n\nStar Breweries invested over four million euros into improving its factories in the 2009-11 period, resulting in a 20% increase in production capacity. These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection in the production of its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.\n\nStar Breweries distributes THB through a network of regional wholesalers, who provide the product to local vendors. Orders are typically sent to the factories on a weekly basis and are filled within two weeks. In 2005 Star Breweries shifted manufacturing of THB in aluminum cans from Mauritius to Antsirabe in order to export the beer to international markets with high Malagasy expatriate populations, including France, Reunion Island, Comoros and Mayotte. All exported THB beer was packaged in aluminum cans manufactured at the Antsirabe brewery; canned THB was also made available alongside the traditional glass bottles in markets in Madagascar that same year. In 2006 the Star Brewery, which employs 1,500 staff, was producing 700,000 hectoliters of beer annually out of the total market share of 800,000; 550,000 hectoliters were produced at the Antsirabe Star Brewery alone. The Antsiranana factory employs 140 staff and produced 180,000 hectoliters of beer (24 million bottles) in 2010.\n\nTo create the original label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured the image of three horses. This was done in part because of the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, \"Soa Ny Fiarahantsika\" (\"The Pleasure of Being Together\"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.\n\nAdvertising alcohol on television and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB \"fête de la bière\" (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.\n\nTHB launched its first website in 2008. In 2015, in honor of the 55th anniversary of national independence, Star Breweries launched a new campaign to promote the beer. The company announced a new slogan, \"THB eo foana e!\" (THB always!) to be promoted alongside its historic slogan. A song by the same name, written and performed by BIG MJ and the group Tambour Gasy, and an accompanying music video, will promote the beer and the new slogan.\n"}

It was made renowned at a Hpnotiq launch event by a restaurant bartender at Sean Combs' New York City restaurant, Justin's. A Hpnotiq employee (Hpnotiq spokesperson Antonio Harer) noticed many women but few men drinking his company's liquor, because the men considered the blue, fruity drink to be too effeminate.

The dish, when served atop breads, can also be a canapé.\n\nThe dish is typically prepared by rolling shucked oysters in bacon and baking them in an oven. Modern variations of angels on horseback include skewering and frying. Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback differ from the similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.\n\nAngels on horseback can be served a hors d'œuvre, as a canapé, or as a savoury. Angels on horseback are canapés when served with breads. In England, they are traditionally served as savouries; salty or savoury items served after the dessert meant to cleanse the palate before the serving of digestifs. One cookbook including angels on horseback as a savoury is the 1905 \"Savouries Simplified\", by Constance Peel.\n\nAngels on horseback should not be confused with devils on horseback. The latter dish, which is derived from the former, uses fruit, typically prunes or dates. American and British chefs including Martha Stewart and Martin Blunos recognise the distinction between the dishes, and though food writer John Ayto does too, he notes that the names have often been used interchangeably. This has been traced to a \"Chicago Tribune\" article and James Beard who \"insisted that angels on horseback required ham as a wrapper, and that if bacon were used, what you'd have would be devils on horseback.\"\n\nThe origins of the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French \"anges à cheval\", and there appears to be no significance in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and other sources, is in 1888, in \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\". However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.\n\nReferences to angels on horseback in the United States date to the mid- to late 1890s. One of the earliest references in an American newspaper is an 1896 article from \"The New York Times\", where the dish is suggested as an appetizer; according to the \"Times\", the dish is to be credited to Urbain Dubois, the chef of the German Emperor, then Kaiser Wilhelm II. In this version, the angels on horseback are skewered, sprinkled with cayenne pepper, and broiled. The article suggests serving the dish with lemon and parsley, but without toast. In the 1930s, they are suggested as part of a picnic menu, and in 1948 again as an appetizer. In the 1950s, American newspapers featured the dish with interest, from papers including the \"Chicago Tribune\", with the articles \"For Oyster Treat, Try Angels on Horseback: They're Delectable Appetizer Sunday Menu\", and \"These Angels on Horseback Are Oysters\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nAngels on horseback did achieve a certain popularity in the 1960s in Washington, D.C.; Evangeline Bruce, wife of US ambassador and diplomatic envoy David K. E. Bruce and renowned for her \"Washington soirees\", served them regularly during the Kennedy administration but even there, the name itself was not commonplace, as suggested by the words of gossip columnist Liz Smith: \"Sometimes the oysters were raw, sometimes they were grilled and wrapped in bacon. Then Mrs. Bruce called them Angels on Horseback.\" As late as the 1980s, the \"Chicago Tribune\" published an article calling the dish \"intriguing\", suggesting it had not yet become commonplace in the United States.\n\nPublications from the 1990s onwards discuss angels on horseback as an indulgence or a delicacy with frequency. \"1001 Foods to Die For\" noted it as an indulgence in North American due to the elevation of oysters to a delicacy status. \"The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink\" noted that the luxury of oysters results in cocktail sausages replacing the oysters.\n\nAccording to the classic recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, suggests frying the skewered oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer.\n\nVariations on the preparation and presentation of the angels on horseback vary considerably. In \"Feng Shui Food\", it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. Joanna Pruess's book \"Seduced by Bacon\" includes a recipe for \"Angels and Devils\", with the suggestion that \"a little hot red pepper sauce can transform them from heavenly to hellishly hot tasting, or somewhere inbetween.\" Myles Bader, author of \"The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets\", suggests serving angels on horseback on toast with a lemon wedge or hollandaise sauce. An Italian variant replaces bacon with prosciutto.\n\nIn the James Bond novel \"Doctor No\", Ian Fleming writes of Bond ordering a dinner in the lair of the title character that includes angels on horseback.\n\n\n"}

Although the dish has existed in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, its more recent egg and vegetable-based form originated in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia).\n\nThe word \"\"Shakshouka\"\" () means \"a mixture\" in Arabic slang specifically in Tunisian Arabic. The word is derived from the Arabic verb شَكَّ shakka, meaning \"stick together, clump together, adhere or cohere\".\n\nTomato-based stews were common throughout the Yemen, Ottoman Empire in Egypt, Syria, the Balkans and the Maghreb. These stews were called \"shakshouka\" in the Maghreb. The Ottoman dish \"şakşuka\" was originally a dish of cooked vegetables with minced meat or liver (\"ciġer\"). Tomato and pepper were introduced to the dish later and meatless variations evolved. Jewish communities in the Ottoman Maghreb served a parve vegetarian variation and Tunisian Jews were known for creating spicy versions of egg shakshouka. \n\nThe exact origins of the dish are disputed. According to \"The Jewish Chronicle\", some food historians believe the dish spread to Spain and the greater Middle East from Ottoman Turkey, while others think it originated in Morocco. A third theory is that it hails from Yemen, where it is served with \"sahawiq\", a hot green paste. \n\nAlthough the dish is not native to the Levant, it was brought to Israel by Tunisian Jews as part of the mass Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands, where it has become a staple due to large Tunisian, Algerian and Moroccan communities. In Israel, shakshouka is made with eggs which are commonly poached but can also be scrambled like the Turkish \"menemen\".\n\nShakshouka is a quintessential meal of Arab cuisine (Yemeni, Libyan, Tunisian, Algerian, Moroccan, Egyptian, Saudi, and Levantine) and is traditionally served in a cast iron pan or tajine as in Morocco.\n\nSome variations of shakshouka can be made with lamb mince, toasted whole spices, yogurt and fresh herbs. Others may include salty cheeses such as feta. Spices can include ground coriander, caraway, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper. \n\nIn Israel, shakshouka is made with eggs which are commonly poached but can also be scrambled like the Turkish \"menemen\". A 1979 Israeli cookbook \"Bishul la-Gever ha-Meshuhrar\" includes a recipe for \"Lufgania Shakshuka\". This is shakshouka made with a kosher version of Spam (called \"loof\") that was added to IDF army rations in the 1950s.\n\nAccording to food writer Claudia Roden, Tunisian cooks added artichoke hearts, potatoes and broad beans to the dish. Because eggs are the main ingredient, it is often on breakfast menus, but in Israel, it is also a popular evening meal, and like hummus and falafel, is a national favorite.\n\n"}

Hazelnut butter is also a good source of dietary protein and vitamin E.\n\nRaw food enthusiasts believe the butter made from unroasted hazelnuts possesses greater nutritional value and more beneficial enzymes, both of which would otherwise be destroyed in the roasting process. Some also advocate that butter prepared from raw hazelnuts should remain refrigerated both before and after opening to minimize oxidation and rancidity.\n\nHazelnut butter can be used in dishes that call for peanut butter, and as an alternative for those with peanut allergies. Hazelnut butter contains more than twice as much vitamin E as peanut butter and is higher in cholesterol-reducing monounsaturated fat.\n\n"}

Most recipes involve meat and offal from a calf, though, making sonofabitch stew something of a luxury item on the trail. Alan Davidson's \"Oxford Companion to Food\" specifies meats and organs from a freshly killed unweaned calf, including the brain, heart, liver, sweetbreads, tongue, pieces of tenderloin, and an item called the \"marrow gut\" and lots of Louisiana hot sauce.\n\nThis last item, the \"marrow gut\", was a key ingredient. Davidson quotes Ramon Adam's 1952 \"Come An' Get It: The Story of the Old Cowboy Cook\", which reports that this is a tube, between two of the calf's stomachs, filled with a substance resembling marrow, deemed edible only while the calf is young and still feeding on milk. This marrow-like substance was included in the stew and, according to Adams, was \"what gave the stew such a delicious flavor\". Davidson says this \"marrow gut\" probably was the passage leading to the abomasum as well as the abomasum itself (said to have a \"distinctive flavour of rennin-curdled milk\"). Another possibility is that \"marrow gut\" refers to the calf's thymus, more commonly known as \"sweetbread\". Sweetbread is indeed commonly found in traditional European cookery and many books refer to the use of this ingredient, including for the preparation of stews made with offal. In German it is called \"Kalbsbries\", in French \"Ris de veau\". A French book originally published in 1928 (Ali-Bab, an alias used by Henri Babinski: \"Gastronomie Pratique\") refers to a recipe involving sweetbread but also the spinal marrow (\"cord\"). Babinski is known for having traveled around the world. \n\nThe stew also contained seasonings and sometimes onion. \nBabinski's recipe for eight guests contains the following ingredients, which cook together for about four hours at moderate heat in the oven, the excess of surfacing fat being removed before serving:\nFrank X. Tolbert's 1962 history of chili con carne, \"A Bowl of Red\", discusses sonofabitch stew as well. Tolbert suggests that the chuck wagon cooks borrowed the idea for the stew from the cooking of the Plains Indians. He also specifies a recipe that never includes onions, tomatoes, or potatoes.\n\nIn addition to \"sonofabitch stew\", the dish was known as \"rascal stew\", \"SOB stew\", or fitted with the name of any unpopular figure at the time: for example, \"Cleveland stew\" in honor of Grover Cleveland, a president in disfavor with the cowboys displaced from the Cherokee Strip. \"In the presence of ladies\", reports a 1942 \"Gourmet\" magazine piece, the dish was commonly called \"son-of-a-gun stew\" instead.

Rihaakuru is produced as a by-product of the processing of tuna.\n\nMaldivian travellers introduced Rihaakuru and Bondi to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). Sri Lankans considered these as delicacies and referred to them as Bondi Haluwa and Diya Hakuru (rhyming derivative, of the original Dhivehi term, which means 'liquid jaggery' in the Sinhalese language) respectively. These terms were popular in Sri Lankan households until the latter part of the 20th century, when they gradually disappeared.\n\nRihaakuru is obtained through following a simple but time-consuming procedure. The extract is the result of hours of cooking of tuna in water and salt, while carefully removing the scum (filleyo) that keeps forming. Once the tuna pieces are cooked and ready to eat or store, they will be removed from the water, as well as the bones, heads and fish guts. The pieces of Tuna, so cooked, get eventually processed into Maldive fish. The remaining \"fish-soup\" (Garudhiya) is left with \"Bondi\" (balls of tuna scraps scraped off the bones), and is kept boiling in low fire until most water evaporates. The resulting concentrated fish soup becomes a thick paste which is known in Dhivehi as Rihaakuru.\n\nRihaakuru is eaten pure in the Maldives along with rice, taro, roti or breadfruit. It is also cooked with fried onions, curry-leaves (hikandifaiy) and chilies in order to obtain a delicious variant called \"theluli rihaakuru\" (spiced rihaakuru). In Maldivian cuisine it is also mixed with coconut milk, to obtain a dish called \"rihaakuru diya\".\n\nIn some countries people use Rihaakuru as a sandwich spread, likening its use to other by-product spreads such as Vegemite, Bovril and Marmite . A noticeable consumption of Rihaakuru has been recorded in China, namely in Chinese dishes like Cha Kuay Teow Mee, Fried Vegetables (Kai Lan, Chye Sim and Pak choy) and Hue Muay.\n\nRihaakuru is slightly acidic (pH 5.6-6.2) and is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3 and protein. The histamine concentration of Rihaakuru has been described as being at levels that are regarded as a risk to human health, however Maldivians are mostly immune to any poisoning that may result from this.\n\n"}

It thus held a symbolic power beyond its importance in military strategy, and was a central place in archaic Roman religion.\n\nDuring the regal period, some members of the elite were permitted to live on the \"Arx\", among them the legendary Sabine leader Titus Tatius. After 384 BC, the Senate banned all private dwellings from the Capitoline Hill, including the \"Arx.\" The house of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, a patrician champion of the \"plebs\" who was convicted of seeking kingship, was torn down at this time and later became the site of the Temple of Juno Moneta.\n\nOn the \"Arx\" was located the auguraculum, the open space where the augurs conducted the rituals that determined whether the gods approved of whatever undertaking was at hand, public business or military action. This auguraculum was the stone where the elected monarch, during the Roman Kingdom, was seated by the augurs with his face to the south.\n\nMajor temples on the \"Arx\" include that of Juno Moneta (established 344 BC), where the mint was located; Concordia (217 BC); Honor and Virtue; and Vediovis. Jupiter, however, was the god of the \"Arx\".\n\nThe Romans also referred to the citadel of other cities as an \"arx\" (plural \"arces\"). Excavations in Cosa, Tuscany, conducted in 1948–54 and 1965–72, uncovered the settlement's \"arx\". Frank E. Brown and his team studied the site extensively when they began the Cosa excavations in 1948. The citadel was a fortified hill on which were built several temples, including the so-called \"capitolium\" of Cosa. \n\nIn Lavinium, south of Rome, Castello Borghese is thought to be the possible site of the Roman-era \"arx\" constructed in the port city.\n\nThe arx of Londinium was located in the northwest corner of the present-day City of London, south of Cripplegate. It was constructed around 120 and dismantled around the time of Diocletian.\n\n"}

A scoop may be a new story, or a new aspect to an existing or breaking news story. It may be unexpected, surprising, formerly secret, and may come from an exclusive source. Events witnessed by many people generally cannot become scoops, (\"e.g.\", a natural disaster, or the announcement at a press conference). However, exclusive news content is not always a scoop, as it may not provide the requisite importance or excitement. A scoop may be also defined retrospectively; a story may come to be known as a scoop because of a historical change in perspective of a particular event. Due to their secret nature, scandals are a prime source of scoops (\"e.g.\", the Watergate scandal by \"Washington Post\" journalists Woodward and Bernstein).\n\nScoops are part of journalistic lore, and generally confer prestige on the journalist or news organization.\n\nThe word \"scoop\" is of American origin, first documented in 1874. As a verb, meaning to beat someone in reporting first, it is first recorded in 1884.\n\nMore generally, a scoop is the first discovery or the first report of something important.\n\nIn some of John le Carré's spy novels, a scoop is new information of major strategic importance, not, of course, intended for publication.\n\nA scoop in the scientific community is a report by one group before another, giving them scientific priority.\n\n"}

Literally translated, \"ginataan\" means \"done with coconut milk\". Due to the general nature of the term, it can refer to a number of different dishes, each called \"ginataan\", but distinct from one another.\n\n\"Ginataan\" usually refers to viands, which are eaten with rice during the major meals of the day. It normally follows the form \"\"ginataan na/ginataang\" + (whatever it is cooked with)\" or \"(dish name) + \"sa gatâ\"\". For example, \"ginataang hipon\" refers to shrimp cooked in coconut milk, \"ginataang gulay\" to an assortment of vegetables cooked in coconut milk, \"ginataang alimango\" is mud crabs cooked in coconut milk, while \"ginataang manok\" is chicken cooked in coconut milk. Coconut milk can also be added to existing dishes, as in \"ginataang adobo\" (known more commonly in Tagalog as \"adobo sa gatâ\").\n\nThere are other dishes that are known by their own unique names, such as Bicol Express, \"laing\" and variants of \"pinakbet\", which nonetheless fall under the \"ginataan\" category because they use coconut milk as one of the main ingredients.\n\nVarious sweet desserts may also simply be called \"ginataan\", especially in the northern Philippines. For example, the Visayan \"binignit\", a soup made with coconut milk, tubers, tapioca pearls, and sago is simply called \"ginataan\" in Tagalog (a shortened form of the proper name, \"ginataang halo-halo\"). This soup is also called \"\"giná-tan\"\" in Bikolano, \"\"ginettaán\"\" in Ilokano, and \"\"ginat-ang lugaw\"\" in Hiligaynon. If gummy balls made of pounded glutinous rice are added, it becomes a dish called \"ginataang bilo-bilo\" or simply \"bilo-bilo\". \"Ginataang mais\" is another example of a dessert soup; a warm, sweet, thick gruel made with coconut milk, sweet corn and glutinous rice.\n\nDishes considered under the \"ginataan\" category include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

It has been cited as an example of an untranslatable word, as there is no single exact English equivalent. It carries much cultural baggage in Russia and has been discussed at length by various writers.\n\nIt is derived from the adjective \nпошлый.\n\nIt has been defined as \"petty evil or self-satisfied vulgarity\", while Svetlana Boym defines it briefly as \"obscenity and bad taste\".\n\nBoym goes on to describe it at more length:\nEarly examinations of \"poshlost\" in literature are in the work of Nikolai Gogol. Gogol wrote (of Pushkin),\nIn his novels, Turgenev \"tried to develop a heroic figure who could, with the verve and abandon of a Don Quixote, grapple with the problems of Russian society, who could once and for all overcome 'poshlost’, the complacent mediocrity and moral degeneration of his environment\". Dostoyevsky applied the word to the Devil; Solzhenitsyn, to Western-influenced young people.\n\nD. S. Mirsky was an early user of the word in English in writing about Gogol; he defined it as \"'self-satisfied inferiority,' moral and spiritual\". Vladimir Nabokov made it more widely known in his book on Gogol, where he romanized it as \"poshlust\" (punningly: \"posh\" + \"lust\"). Poshlust, Nabokov explained, \"is not only the obviously trashy but mainly the falsely important, the falsely beautiful, the falsely clever, the falsely attractive. A list of literary characters personifying \"poshlust\" will include... Polonius and the royal pair in \"Hamlet\", Rodolphe and Homais from \"Madame Bovary\", Laevsky in Chekhov's 'The Duel', Joyce's Marion [Molly] Bloom, young Bloch in \"Search of Lost Time\", Maupassant's 'Bel Ami', Anna Karenina's husband, and Berg in \"War and Peace\"\". also listed\nAzar Nafisi mentions it and quotes the \"falsely\" definition in \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\".\n\nNabokov often targeted \"poshlost\" in his own work; the Alexandrov definition above refers to the character of M'sieur Pierre in \"Invitation to a Beheading\".\n\nAnother notable literary treatment is Fyodor Sologub's novel \"The Petty Demon\". It tells the story of a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. James H. Billington said of it:\nRichard Taruskin summarized poshlost as \"highfalutin bad taste,\" applying the term to a performance of the Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev).\n\n"}

Some mattress protectors also provide protection to the person sleeping on the mattress from allergens and irritants such as dust mites, bed bugs, mold, and dead skin (like dandruff).\n\nAlthough the surface of a mattress can be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner, it is very difficult to completely remove stains from most standard mattresses. An unprotected mattress can become marked or stained quite quickly as natural perspiration produced throughout the night passes through a standard cloth sheet and creates a characteristic yellowish-brown tidemark where it has been absorbed into the upper surface of the mattress. Mattresses are also susceptible to many other contaminant.\n\nThe simplest form of a mattress protector is a lightly quilted fitted sheet. It provides minimal protection against liquids and little or no protection from dust mite allergens.\n\nIn addition to conventional natural fabrics, new forms of synthetic protector or topper have appeared over the years including memory foam and spacer fabrics. These are more expensive than conventional protectors but add the advantages of pressure relief and in the case of the latter, the ability to be washed.\n\nWaterproof mattress protectors keep the mattress clean by securing it from absorbing body excretions (such as sweat) or other liquids resulting from spills. These can take the form of flat rubberized flannel pads (commonly used under a bedsheet for infants) or special breathable fitted covers. The plastic pads are hot to sleep on and change the feel of the mattress. A urethane laminate on cotton that has good wicking properties is an alternative to a rubberized flannel pad. A protector with a thin laminate that is not pulled too tightly across the bed will not change the feel of the bed. Also, the laminate is still breathable which means that it will not trap body heat.\n\nMost mattress warranties are voided if the mattress gets a stain, so most sleepers use mattress pads to prevent stains.\n\nThe use of a mattress protector is often recommended to individuals who are known to be susceptible to certain kinds of allergies, especially dust mites. Dust mites produce waste products that irritate the lining of the airways and lungs and particularly with children can bring on allergic reactions, asthma and can irritate skin conditions such as eczema. A full zippered encasement allergen filtration mattress protector can provide an extra layer of protection between the user and their mattress, filtering allergens that are known to trigger allergy and asthma symptoms.\n\nFor protection against bed bugs, the mattress and box spring must both be fully enclosed with no possible openings. Zippered cases are commonly used for this purpose. This prevents new bed bugs from getting into the mattress and box spring, and traps any bed bugs that are already inside. Mattress protectors must be left on for at least a full year to make sure that the trapped bed bugs and their eggs die. If the cover is taken off early, the bed bug infestation may relapse.\n\nWaterproof mattress protectors also reduce allergy symptoms by reducing the ability of mold to grow in a mattress. Mattress protectors which can be easily disinfected are commonly used in children's nurseries and health care facilities.\n\nA 2002 Norwegian study has found that foam mattresses are 4 to 8 times more likely to host dust mite feces than spring mattresses.\n\nThere are different types of mattress protectors. Encasements are shields that protect the mattress directly, typically from bed bugs, and are often used in hotels. Protectors are used to protect the mattress from bed-wetting or allergic situations. In contrast, mattress pads and mattress toppers are primarily used to provide comfort features for the user. Pads are thinner, while the thicker toppers tend to be more comfortable and expensive.\n\nIn hospital or other medical settings, a disposable underpad may be used to absorb blood and other bodily fluid, in concert with a hospital gown. This is sometimes light blue and known as chux pad, after an old brand name for a disposable diaper.\n"}

It is a staple food in Western Africa. It originates from the Mandinka and Bambara people of Mali. Variants of the dish appear in the cuisine of nations throughout West Africa and Central Africa. It is very similar to groundnut soup. It may have a thicker consistency. Made from lamb, beef, chicken, or without meat, maafe is cooked with a sauce based on groundnuts, especially peanut butter/paste, and tomatoes. Peanut paste is sometimes used as an ingredient. Groundnut stew is sometimes prepared with the addition of meat, such as chicken, and vegetables. In Ghana, groundnut stew is often accompanied with fufu.\n\nThe dish originated with the Mandinka and Bambara people of Mali.

In Senegal \"domodah\" or \"domoda\" is another dish different from \"mafe\". It is a favorite dish among several Senegal and Gambia ethnic groups. With the huge expansion of groundnut cultivation during the colonial period, Maafe has also become a popular dish across West Africa, even outside West Africa such as in Cameroon and France.\n\nRecipes for the stew vary wildly, but commonly include chicken, tomato, onion, garlic, cabbage, and leaf or root vegetables. Other versions include okra, corn, carrots, cinnamon, hot peppers, paprika, black pepper, turmeric, cumin, and other spices. Maafe is traditionally served with white rice (in Senegal, Mauritania and Gambia), \"fonio\" or \"to\" (millet porridge) in Mali, couscous (as West Africa meets the Sahara, in Sahelian countries), or fufu and sweet potatoes in the more tropical areas, such as the Ivory Coast. \"Um'bido\" is a variation using greens, while Ghanaian maafe is cooked with boiled eggs.

Nevertheless, \"sate kambing\" (lamb satay) is a generic term to describes mutton satay in the region, regardless to their specific recipes.\n\nGoats are widely consumed domesticated animal in Indonesia, they can easily be seen roaming the country’s villages or kept as livestock in backyards. In a country with a majority Muslim population, goat meat or mutton is one of the most preferred meats. Goats and muttons are often slaughtered during Eid ul Adha Muslim religious ritual, resulting the goat/lamb dishes such as \"sate kambing\" (lamb satay) and \"gulai kambing\" (lamb curry) will appears and commonly consumed during this Muslim festival.\n\nAlmost all parts of goat's meat could be made as \"sate kambing\" (goat satay), although the prime part would be the hind legs. Some variant might uses goat offals, and it is considered as a delicacy, such as \"sate hati kambing\" that uses goat liver, and \"sate torpedo\" that uses goat testicles, believed to have aphrodisiac property.\n\nThe skewers that being used for \"sate kambing\" (lamb satay) are usually larger and thicker, and made from bamboo, compared to thinner skewers used for chicken satay that usually used mid-ribs of coconut leaf. This is corresponds to the thickness and texture of goat meat that is tougher than chicken. To avoid burning, the skewers are usually being soaked in water first prior of using. The skewered mutton/lamb is then marinated in spices before being placed on a charcoal grill. The marination seasoning would include puréed pineapple juice, sweet soy sauce, ground shallot and galangal. In restaurants or street stall \"warungs\", \"sate kambing\" (lamb satay) are made to order and grilled right away after customer placed their order.\n\nA set meal of \"sate kambing\" (lamb satay) usually consists of the mutton satay itself, commonly served in a thick black-colored sauce made of \"kecap manis\" or sweet soy sauce. Some recipes however, might use peanut sauce instead, although peanut sauce are more commonly used to serve chicken satay. Some people would eat it with common steamed rice, while others might prefer traditional rice cakes like \"lontong\" or \"ketupat\". In some areas, sate kambing (lamb satay) is sold together with another popular food named \"gulai kambing\" (lamb curry), which is a spicy goat meat and offal soup.\n\nSince goat meat has a somewhat distinct and quite strong aroma, those who do not like the smell usually would replace the goat meat\n\nwith lamb or beef. Similar satay recipes might also be made with other kind of meats, e.g. meat of beef, chicken, fish, pork and others.\n\n\n"}

The layered pastry is named after its inventor, Hungarian chef József C. Dobos, a delicatessen owner in Budapest. In the late 1800s, he decided to create a cake that would last longer than other pastries in an age when cooling techniques were limited. The round sides of the cake are coated with ground hazelnuts, chestnuts, walnuts, or almonds, and the hardened caramel top helps to prevent drying out, for a longer shelf life.\nDobos torte was first introduced at the \"National General Exhibition of Budapest\" in 1885; King Franz Joseph I and Queen Elisabeth were among the first to taste it. The cake soon became popular throughout Europe, both for its durability through shipping and for its unique appearance. With its flat, shiny, caramel glazed top, it was simple but elegant, as opposed to the more intricate cakes of the age. It was notable for its use of fine chocolate buttercream, which was very little known at the time; cake fillings and frostings were usually made with cooked pastry cream or whipped cream. Dobos had discovered buttercream while traveling in France but he invented the batter of the cake. \n\nNotably, the cream incorporated cocoa butter for extra smoothness. During his lifetime, the cake was often imitated, but never reproduced. Dobos traveled to other countries in Europe to introduce his cake, and soon began exporting the product in specially designed wooden boxes. Near the end of his career, in 1906, Dobos donated his recipe to the Pastry and Honey-Makers' Guild.\n\nThe history of the Dobos torte is illustrated at the Dobos Chocolate Museum in Szentendre, a town 20 kilometers northwest of Budapest.\n\nMany cookbooks include a recipe for Dobos torte and these can vary significantly.

The term originates from the Acadian French word meaning \"clangour\" or \"din\". The practice is intended to demonstrate the vitality and solidarity of Acadian society, and to remind others of the presence of Acadians. It originated in the mid-twentieth century, likely inspired by an ancient French folk custom.\n\nTintamarre is a recent tradition established by people of Acadian descent in Canada in the mid-20th century, although it is believed to have been inspired by the ancient French folk custom of \"Charivari\". In 1955, during the commemorations of the 200th anniversary of the Expulsion of the Acadians, the Archbishop of Moncton, Norbert Robichaud, circulated an instruction sheet for the marking of the event. He advised families to kneel in outdoor prayer once the church bells began to ring, and he wrote:\n\nRené Lévesque, a Radio-Canada journalist was in Moncton covering the commemoration of the Acadian deportation, and described the \"tintamarre\" in his report:\n\nIn 1979, the \"Société Nationale des Acadiens\" sought to revive the Tintamarre for the celebrations in Caraquet, New Brunswick of the 375th anniversary of the founding of Acadia. Organizers urged celebrants to reaffirm their Acadian identity loudly and clearly, so as to emphasize the slogan of the celebrations: \"On est venus c'est pour rester\" (\"We've come back and we're here to stay\"). In 1980, although there were no official efforts to organize any noisemaking, spontaneous Tintamarres were reported in Caraquet and in other Acadian communities in New Brunswick. By 1984, area newspapers noted discussions of holding \"traditional Tintamarres\" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Flag of Acadia, even though the \"tradition\" was only a few decades old.\n\nThe Tintamarre held during the 2009 \"Festival acadien\" in Caraquet involved 40,000 participants.\n\nAlong with the Acadian flag and the hymn \"Ave Maris Stella\", the Tintamarre has become widely recognized as an Acadian symbol. It has become an important part of National Acadian Day celebrations in Canada and of any other events affirming Acadian identity and accomplishments. In 2006, a Tintamarre was held to help inaugurate a new medical training program at the Université de Moncton; when asked why noisemaking had been included in an academic event, organizers explained that the Tintamarre was \"an essential Acadian custom\".\n\nA number of communities in Atlantic Canada, including Bouctouche, Moncton, Summerside, Caraquet, Clare and Chéticamp, hold annual Tintamarres, with the provincial governments of both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia promoting these events as tourist attractions. The tradition has extended beyond Acadia, with Tintamarres being held to celebrate the Franco-Ontarian community in Hawkesbury, Ontario, to launch the annual \"Semaine de la Francophonie\" in Toronto, and to mark Acadian Week in the town of Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados, France. A Tintamarre was held on the Saint Leonard – Van Buren International Bridge on the Canada–United States border as part of the 2014 Acadian World Congress, which took place in the border counties of Aroostook in Maine, Témiscouata in Quebec, and Victoria, Madawaska and Restigouche in New Brunswick. The largest tintamarre parade is actually held in Bouctouche, New Brunswick, while in Caraquet, New Brunswick people gather in the streets to make noise, making more like a “foire” meaning a fair or festival.\n\n"}

Unlike in many other Pacific cultures, the official chiefly positions are not allocated according to any strict primogeniture, but rather are elected from all eligible males within certain kạinaga (family or clan groups) to whom the chiefly title belongs.\n\nIn modern Rotuma, gagaja is the major traditional leadership position, other than mata or district representatives. Gagaja exist at two levels:\n\nThese are the district chiefs, who represent each of the seven districts on the Rotuma Island Council, the main deliberative body for the island of Rotuma. In addition to these duties, they oversee the day-to-day life of the district, assembling villagers to assist in large projects, which he organises with the consensus given by villagers in village meetings, which he chairs. The district chiefs are ranked, and served kava and food in ceremonial settings in an order dictated by their serving rank. The serving rank is determined by the role they played in the last war. Given that Rotuma hasn't seen any war since the Rotuman Religious Wars, this order hasn't changed since 1878. The order is:\n\n\nThis order reflects the Wesleyan Methodist alliance between Noa'tau, Oinafa, Itu'ti'u and Malhaha which won the last conflict, whereas the latter serving of Pepjei and Juju (collectively known as Fag'uta) and Itu'muta indicates that they were defeated as part of the unsuccessful Catholic alliance. Given the inter-district political instability following that war, Rotuma was ceded to Great Britain in 1881 at the behest of the English Wesleyan missionaries.\n\nMany chiefly positions come with titles, known as 'as togi, which belong to the chiefly mosega of the district. The mosega (literally 'bed') is a group of often three or four clans (kạinaga) who are descendants of the original ancestral title-holder. Upon the death of a chief, the new chief is selected from amongst the members of the mosega to whom the title belongs. Ideally the title should evenly rotate amongst the kạinaga of the chiefly mosega, however the modern process is often politicized.\n\nThe second ranking title in each district is the fạufisi, who acts as an administrative official together with the gagaj 'es itu'u, and deputizes for him in his absence.\n\nThe ho'aga ('village') is an administrative unit consisting of clusters of households forming cooperating working groups, and these work efforts are directed by the fa 'es ho'aga ('man with village' in the Rotuman language). Fa 'es ho'aga are appointed from the chiefly mosega of the village and the position also usually comes with an ‘as togi (chiefly title).\n\nIn Christianity, Gagaja is often translated as meaning 'Lord', as in \"Lord God\" (\"Gagaj Aitu\").\n\n"}

A roulade, like a braised dish, is often browned then covered with wine or stock and cooked. Such a roulade is commonly secured with a toothpick, metal skewer or a piece of string. The roulade is sliced into rounds and served. Of this common form, there are several notable dishes:\n\nIn Italian cuisine, roulades are known as \"Involtini\" (singular \"involtino\"). \"Involtini\" can be thin slices of beef, pork, or chicken rolled with a filling of grated cheese (usually Parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano), sometimes egg to give consistency and some combination of additional ingredients such as bread crumbs, other cheeses, minced prosciutto, ham or Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, garlic, spinach, \"pignoli\" (pine nuts), etc. \"Involtini\" (diminutive form of \"involti\") means \"little bundles\". Each involtino is held together by a wooden toothpick, and the dish is usually served (in various sauces: red, white, etc.) as a second course. When cooked in tomato sauce, the sauce itself is used to toss the pasta for the first course, giving a consistent taste to the whole meal.\n\nIn southern parts of Italy such as Sicily, where fish are a more plentiful element of cuisine, involtini can sometimes be made with fish such as swordfish. This term encompasses dishes like Braciole (a roulade consisting of beef, pork or chicken usually filled with Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs and eggs) and saltimbocca.\n\nSome roulades consist of cake (often sponge cake) baked in a flat pan rolled around a filling. Cake rolled around jam, chocolate buttercream, nuts or other fillings, is an example of a sweet roulade like the bejgli or the Swiss roll. The bûche de Noël or \"Yule log\" is a traditional French Christmas cake roll, often decorated with frosting made to look like bark. \n\nAnother form of non-meat roulade consists of a soufflé-type mixture baked in a flat pan rolled around a filling.\n\n"}

By 2050, these proportions will increase to 21% and 36%.\n\nGeriatric nurses are expected to be skilled in patient care, treatment planning, education, mental health, and rehabilitation. They also take on many roles in the workplace. The main responsibility is as a caregiver. They can also be advocates, counselors, and educators for their patients.\n\nGerontological nursing draws on knowledge about complex factors that affect the health of older adults. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to have one or more chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, hearing impairment, or a form of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. As well, drug metabolism changes with aging, adding to the complexity of health needs.\n\nGerontological nurses work in a variety of settings, including acute care hospitals, rehabilitation, nursing homes (also known as long term care homes and skilled nursing facilities), assisted living facilities, retirement homes, community health agencies, and the patient's home.\nThe conditions of the geriatric patient's health determines what type of facility one should reside in. Assisted living facilities are also known as senior retirement homes, and they provide care services depending on health conditions. Skilled nursing, otherwise known as a nursing home, is a place where they can reside and get provided with 24/7 cares. Older adults have been referred to as \"the core business of healthcare\" by gerontological nursing experts. Population aging and the complexity of health care needs of some older adults means that older adults are more likely than younger people to use health care services. In many settings, the majority of patients are older adults. Thus, experts recommend that all nurses, not only those identified as gerontological nurses, need specialized knowledge about older adults. This position was endorsed by 55 US nursing specialty organizations.\n\nIncluding, GAPNA (formerly NCGNP) which was founded in 1981, by a group of Gerontological Nurse Practitioners with the intention of offering the first continuing education conferences designed specifically to meet the needs of advanced practice nurses providing care for older adults. Currently, GAPNA represents the interests of all advanced practice nurses who work with older adults. These advance practice nurses are active in a variety of settings across the continuum including primary, acute, post-acute and long-term care. GAPNA an organization for advanced practice nurses seeking continuing education in gerontological care as well as networking and peer support from experienced clinicians.\n\nThe last few decades have brought in more interest in older people as their numbers in society grow. More people than ever before are surviving to their senior years which substantially makes the demand for more working nurses in gerontology. Viewing aging as a natural process also develops more positive attitudes towards working with older adults.\n\nThe terms Gerontology and Geriatrics are often used interchangeably, but there are differences between the two. Gerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of ageing. Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people.\n\nGerontological Nurses need to know how to care for illnesses that affect the aging, the other factors affect aging, and how these impact people.\n\nAlthough nurses published articles about care of older adults as early as 1904, the specialty of gerontological nursing emerged beginning in the 1950s, with the publication of the first gerontological nursing textbook. Pioneers in the field of gerontological nursing include Vera McIver, Doris Schwartz, Mary Opal Walanin.\nA geriatric nursing specialty group was formed by the American Nurses Association in 1966, with the name changed to the Gerontological Nursing Division in 1976. In the US, the National Gerontological Nursing Association was founded in 1984 and in 1985 the Canadian Gerontological Nursing Association was founded. Standards of practice for gerontological nursing were published by the American Nurses Association in 1971. In the US, certification for geriatric nurse practitioners and clinical specialists were available in 1984.\n\nThe specialty has advanced significantly since the 1990s through large scale education and practice development initiatives funded by the John A. Hartford Foundation, including the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing at New York University. Significant efforts to enhance nursing education have been made in the last decade. In 2010, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing and the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing published the Recommended Baccalaureate Competences and Curricular Guidelines for the Nursing Care of Older Adults. Between 2007 and 2009 the Geriatric Nursing Education Consortium created teaching tools and trained educators in the US to improve gerontological content in nursing education.\n\nGerontological nursing includes generalist and specialist practice. A generalist is a registered nurse or Licensed Practical Nurse. A gerontological nurse specialist is an advanced practice nurse or nurse practitioner who has graduate education in gerontological nursing.\n\nSpecific education in gerontological care is important for all nurses, even those who work outside of long-term care, because older adults make up a significant portion of patients across specialties. However, additional certification in Gerontological care is uncommon for registered nurses, with less than 1% being certified. Fewer than 3% of advance practice nurses in the United States have this certification.\n\nRegistered nurses have the option of becoming certified in gerontological nursing. National nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center and the Canadian Nurses Association offer certification in gerontological nursing. Requirements for maintaining certification vary. The American Nurses Credentialing Center lists requirements as including 2 years experience as an RN, 2,000 hours of clinical experience and 30 hours of continuing education, both within the specialty of gerontological nursing. Post graduate certificates in gerontological nursing are also available by completing continuing education courses through colleges and universities.\n\nMost often times, gerontological nursing is often ignored within baccalaureate educational programs, with only 1/3rd of all schools requiring a specific course in geriatrics. This is due to educational programs focusing more attention on the sick rather than the well, who are more representative of the older population. 1/4th of all nursing programs in the United States do not have a gerontological staff member.\n\nTo better identify those who are most qualified and experienced in managing patient care, there is an APRN Specialty Certification in Gerontology. This APRN Gerontological Specialist Certification (GS-c) distinguishes APRNs who possess expert knowledge, experience, and skill in managing the complex health needs of older adults.\n\nThe nursing shortage continues to affect all aspects of nursing, and gerontological nursing is no exception. It is estimated that 50-150% more nurses will be needed in this speciality in the next decade. Often times nursing students do not express a desire to work in gerontological nursing as their specialty. This can be due to negative stereotypes, misconceptions, and attitudes toward the aging that are common among nursing students. Gerontological nursing can be unpopular because geriatric nurses are sometimes perceived to be somewhat inferior in capabilities, or not good enough for other specialties. Facilities have also discouraged competent nurses from working in these settings by paying low salaries.\n\nGeriatric care facilities face a problem of staff retention of both professional workers (including registered nurses) and paraprofessionals (including nursing assistants). The American Healthcare Association found a turnover rate of 65% for registered nurses working in nursing homes.\n\nBurnout among nurses in geriatric care is common. Physical stressors, such as frequent heavy lifting, and emotional stressors, such as regularly encountering death, all contribute.\n"}

The beer was first brewed in 1919 under its former name, \"Foster's Crown Lager\".\n\nCarlton & United Breweries has promoted Crown Lager (known colloquially as a \"crownie\") with the story that it was originally brewed in 1919 as \"Foster's Crown Lager\" and was initially only available to visiting dignitaries that visited Australia. During the first royal visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Australia in 1954, Carlton & United Breweries marked the occasion releasing Crown Lager. The company is currently re-investigating this history following claims that Foster's Crown Lager was brewed prior to 1919 and that it was widely available to the public prior to 1954.\n\nCrown lager is recognisable by its uniquely shaped bottle and by its 1954-trademarked logo that has only changed four times in the history of the beer, and remains one of Australia's most popular premium lagers. The unique bottle shape and label was designed by Eveline Annie Harvey (22 May 1910 — 5 August 2008), a commercial artist working in Melbourne who was also responsible for many other well-known labels during the period, such as Monbulk Jam and others. Harvey was the artist chosen by General Douglas McArthur to draw critical and highly secretive maps during the war. Harvey produced the Crown Lager artwork at print size using only a (single haired) paintbrush and exceptional skill as were the methods of the time.\nIn 2003, former Foster’s President and CEO Ted Kunkel declared that in that year in a speech that 2003 would be the 50th anniversary for Crown Lager. Kunkel had also announced that the beer continued to show high growth, concluding the beer was still Australia's leading premium beer. Crown Lager was originally produced as an export beer—the current bottle shape and label remain mostly identical to Harvey's original artwork except that the word 'Export' has been removed. Crown Lager has marketed itself as a premium beer in the Australian market. As such it has formed an affiliation with Golf Australia to create the Crown Lager Social Golf Club.\n\nIn 2006 CUB released two alternative types of beer under the crown banner.\n\n\"Crown Gold\" is a Mid-strength beer, available only in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The ale was launched in 2014 to hold its market share in an increasing competitive beer market. Crown Lager sales in the March 2014 results had shown that it had declined in the past year.\n\n\n\n"}

It was formerly possible to find an oblong version, known as a \"cottage brick\", and common in the London area.\n\nCottage loaves, while formerly common, are now rarely found in bakeries, as they are relatively time-consuming and difficult to make, and in common with other round loaves are less convenient for slicing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8875410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8875410", "title": "Chinese chicken salad", "text": "Chinese chicken salad\n\nChinese chicken salad is a salad including chopped chicken and Chinese culinary ingredients that are common in parts of the United States. Though many variations exist, common features of Chinese chicken salads include lettuce, cabbage, chicken (typically breast meat), deep-fried wonton skins or rice vermicelli and nuts (sliced almonds, cashews or peanuts). A basic vinaigrette for the salad includes ingredients like vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar (or citrus juice). Optional seasonings include dry hot mustard, sesame seeds, coriander and raw ginger or pickled ginger. In restaurants, Chinese chicken salad may be more embellished and offered as an American-style entree salad, similar to Caesar, Chef, and Cobb salads.\n\nThe Chinese chicken salad that is popular in the US seems to be a product of pan-Asian cuisine or fusion cuisine influences, rather than having roots in Chinese cuisine. Reasoning for that theory is that green lettuce salad is a dish of primarily Western origins.\n\nMany non-Western world cultures also have salads of various sorts as part of their traditional cuisines. In \"Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads\", Sylvia Lovegren writes, \"There are many different types of cold chicken salad in China, although most of them seem to originate in Szechwan. But the Chinese chicken salad being consumed ... by the fashionable set, probably originated in California.\" In \"Hollywood Dish\", Akasha Richmond writes, \"Hollywood gave rise to more salads than just the Caesar and Cobb. The 1960s produced the Chinese Chicken Salad, which was made popular at Madame Wu's in Santa Monica. Cary Grant asked her to put it on the menu after eating it at another restaurant.\"\n\nAccording to a website about Sylvia Cheng Wu, who is popularly known by her alias \"Madame Wu\", \"She came up with something better, using a recipe she vaguely remembered having encountered in Shanghai. It was a blend of shredded chicken, fried vermicelli, green onions and toasted almonds. Madame Wu’s soon became known for her Chinese chicken salad, now an American luncheon classic.\" But, the popularity of Chinese Chicken salad was not necessarily mainstream yet, although perhaps intimated and attempted throughout the years and generations.\n\nIn the United States, many common cookbooks from circa 1900 to the 1950s would include chicken salad; but, for many of them, that would often presume a bound salad with chopped vegetables and mayonnaise, typically without lettuce. For example, \"The Settlement Cookbook\" by Mrs. Simon Kander, published as early as 1910, includes a simple \"Lettuce salad\" with chopped onion and French or German dressing; but, no Chinese, Asian or Oriental salad of any kind. Similar bound chicken salads were found in \"Joy of Cooking\" as of the 1974 editions (first published as of 1931). It was by 1950s that main course type salads started to appear in books like \"Better Homes & Gardens, New Cook Book\"; whereas, that often included Caesar salad along with the usual bound chicken salad, but no Asian-styled or -flavored salads. The \"Good Housekeeping Cookbook\" introduced a \"Sesame-Spinach Salad,\" with soy sauce and salad oil, although not with sesame oil; whereas, this introduced something closer to Asian flavors, such as comparatively to what also included a few curry salads and still others that were similar to \"Better Homes\". The next generation of ever more exotic and main course salads were on the way.\n\nWith intimations of Asian-style lettuce salads appearing by the 1950s and into the 1970s, publishers like California's Sunset Magazine stated in their popular cookbooks and guides that \"You'll find such classics as Caesar, Waldorf, and Crab Louis; international favorites with exotic names like Tabbuli and Antipasto; satisfying whole-meal salads like Shrimp-stuffed Avocados and Taco Salad...\" and so on. Suddenly, sesame seeds went from just being a garnish on a salad, to being an ingredient for a recipe of \"Sesame Seed Dressing\" (p. 6); but, more over, and indeed, there was now a recipe for \"Chinese Chicken Salad\" (p. 35).\n\n\"Sunset's\" recipe for Chinese Chicken appeared similarly as to what it's known as today, including: soy sauce; salad oil; garlic and ginger; (relatively exotic) Chinese five-spice or (more common substitute) ground cinnamon); broiler fryer chicken (marinated in sherry wine); sesame seed; shredded iceberg lettuce; green onions; coriander (cilantro); cashews or peanuts; and lemon dressing. It was noted therein, that \"Many variations of this salad vie for popularity. This one, without traditional crisp noodles, is simpler than most...\" since, fried vermicelli noodles is probably difficult to find and make for many homemakers. Most of these recipes had not yet included sesame oil, seemingly still rare to find for most homemakers.\n\nBeyond that, perhaps reflecting the California lifestyle and its eventual approach to the newer California Cuisine that used fresh ingredients and contemporary, multicultural flare, \"Sunset\" also now provided countless other Asian salad recipes, seeming to recognize the new trend and desire: Oriental Cabbage Slaw (p. 24); Oriental Wilted Romaine Salad (p. 25); Chicken in Cantaloupe with Curry Dressing (no lettuce) (p. 33); Hoisin Chicken Salad (p. 36); Oriental Turkey Salad (p. 37); and so on. The new Chinese and other Asian salads were added with a broad arrangement of other main salads, although perhaps not authentic, they were nevertheless styled and inspired by exotic cuisines and ingredients. Sunset's salad book and recipes seemed to appeal to Americans's desire for greater variety and international fares.\n\nThe continued popularity of Chinese chicken salad has established its regular feature on many restaurant menus, including from the fast food establishment Wendy's \"Asian Cashew Chicken Salad\" to the upscale \"Chinois Chicken Salad\" by Wolfgang Puck; of which, this later figure is indeed one of the few pioneers of California Cuisine.\nToday's Chinese chicken salad has been developed, but found its contributions from various restaurants, cookbooks and online recipes. As a quick and easy homestyle salad this salad may contain a combination of water chestnuts and mandarin orange slices; as well as use of store-bought instant ramen noodles and a seasoning packet that is used to flavor a vinaigrette dressing. All of these recipes provide variations of the salad's style and theme; all of them representing interpretations from various contributors.\n\nWhile Chinese chicken salad, and its variations, have also been known as \"Asian Chicken Salad\" and \"Oriental Chicken Salad\"; more over, it has as well (sometimes) seen the removal of chicken from the dish and its name (if not adding or substituting other ingredients, like seafood).\n\n"}

Rice taken from a fridge should be heated in its own individual serving amount, but rice that is still not in a fridge (or will not get to it at all) is still out of recommendation to be re-heated whole.\n\nObjects manipulating rice before being put to a fridge especially should be clean with at least a soapy substance, a residues remover soaked in it and running water; preferentially, sterilization methods safe to human domestic use are more efficient. Also, important to note is that the more biological seasoning – except for herbs with antimicrobial activity – a boiled rice pot gets, the more perishable it gets. This is especially true, in general, for vegetables with a higher water content (thus fried onion bits make rice more perishable than ground garlic sofrito, for example, taking into account them being added in similar cooking periods – whether 1. fried before the rice is added to their pot 2. added after the rice's frying is complete 3. added while the rice is boiling 4. added after the already boiled rice is dry, ready to eat).\n\nWith the smallest possible trace of water (dried at room temperature in the case it is washed; effects of using a microwave to make the drops and wetness evaporate might not be desirable), it is put to fry in vegetable oil (a practice known as , literally \"to make a sofrito\") before adding salt, it should be over 100 °C upon adding table salt, water at room temperature is added only a few instants before the rice is almost going to burn, it should be always stirred to make sure the ones at the bottom of the pot do not enter combustion.\n\nWhen water is finally added, it should be given generously, and the rice is then finally put to boil (do not stir it any more time, unless it is desired to make another dish with this rice that includes some form of previously boiling sauce still exposed to heat); in the case it evaporates before the rice is at a texture appropriate to human chewing, more water should be added when noises of vapor bubbles heard coming from the bottom turn more violent than usual as rice finding the overly heated pot contributes to the sounds (it sounds a bit more like deep-frying, though with a more sultry and less \"watery\" characteristic to the sound). Heating is lowered a bit before such a process starts, preferentially (some 5–10 minutes, practice gives use to the right time).\n\nThe second water pouring is added not generously (otherwise it can give a soppy, sticky texture to the rice, aside a brick state, what is especially prone to fungal spoiling – especially so since it should get less heating than the boiling process –, as would putting it to boil a third time to warm it; the standard style rice should ideally be as floppy and al dente pasta-like in texture as it gets), and a kettle is put over the pot. It is done merely with the intent of making the rice at the bottom of the pot not burn. Most of the cooking from now on would actually be steaming rather than boiling. Some people prefer to preemptively add a little less water to the boiling process (without a kettle) to make sure the first water pouring does not last too long and the bottom rice does not get burned while the heating is still considerably high. A small opening should be made separating the kettle from its correct position a few millimeters or centimeters for some 3–8 minutes before the heating is turned off, to make sure the steam gets out and does not condense afterwards (as has been mentioned previously, there are various problems associated with leaving a \"Brazilian\" rice too wet) and/or continues to cook the rice past the right point.\n\nMost of the difference in recipes surrounds around the right time to which the raisins, vegetables and often meat is added to the rice, and whether they are all fried together previously or not.\n\nOther differences include what is added to the rice before the raisins and vegetables (might include garlic, onions, biological coloring and even lentils, soy sauce, MSG or rosemary), how the rice is cooked, and obviously, what to add to the rice.\n\nGiven the many differences between ingredients in such a dish, Brazilians expect the rate of spoiling to be likely higher and instead of lasting at least 2 days out of a fridge as plain rice is generally purposed as, can be stored in refrigeration in the same day it is done. Also unlike plain rice, it can be purposed to be eaten cold.\n"}

It opened its second restaurant in 1977 in Fuk Wing Street, Sham Shui Po. By September 1991 when Fairwood made its initial public offering, it had expanded to 52 locations and operated its own facility for processing food in an effort to lower costs and maintain consistency.\n\nOn 31 December 2008, Fairwood announced that Chan Chee Shing would replace Dennis Lo as CEO of Fairwood Holdings, with Mr. Lo retaining his position as Chairman.\n\nFairwood originally adopted a green color scheme in its first stores and used a happy clown on its logo. Its name literally means \"big happiness\".\n\nThe SARS outbreak in 2003 had a negative impact on the fast food industry in Hong Kong and as a result, Fairwood conducted research and subsequently rebranded itself. It contracted graphics designer Alan Chan to design its new logo, that of a \"jumping man\" which is made to resemble the Chinese character for \"big\" (大). Overnight, Fairwood changed all the signs on its stores.\n\nOn 18 November 2003, Fairwood launched a new flagship store in Causeway Bay. The new store concept, designed by Steve Leung and Yasumichi Morita, featured shades of orange, vinyl material, and an overall vibrant look that was intended to increase the restaurant's appeal.\n\nIn addition to a visual redesign, Fairwood reformulated and improved its signature dishes and released them under the \"Ah Wood\" brand. These dishes included such favorites as curry beef brisket and baked pork chop over rice. Fairwood also banned smoking in all of its restaurants, a first for any fast food chain in Hong Kong at the time. This was before the public smoking ban in indoor areas in Hong Kong in 2007.\n\nIn March 2007, Fairwood announced its plans to increase its restaurant count to 100 in Hong Kong and to 30 in Mainland China by 2010. This expansion will be accompanied by a marketing campaign featuring celebrities in order to attract a more youthful crowd. In addition, Fairwood will expand its menu in its Mainland outlets to better cater to local tastes.\n\nIn 2008, Fairwood opened its first Beijing franchise restaurant at Joy City (西单悦城) located in Xidan.\n\nFairwood serves fast food, including a blend of Chinese, Japanese and Western cuisine. The menu changes throughout the day and is split into 4 meal times: Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea and Dinner. In addition, some items may sell out and be replaced by others. The entire menu is evaluated and rotated on a weekly basis. In all, Fairwood cycles around over 200 dishes.\n\nDishes themselves include staples such as Siu Mei, baked pork chop with rice, curry beef brisket and twists on Western dishes such as fried eggs with luncheon meat, spaghetti bolognaise and baked macaroni with ham. Soups such as Russian borscht are also served. On occasion, more seasonal dishes will be served.

It is also very common throughout the Mediterranean Basin and is found in Provence and Roussillon, France and in the coastal regions of Italy (where the most common variant using salt cod fillets is known as \"filetto di baccalà\") and Greece (where various fish like Mediterranean sand smelt, European anchovy, cod, common sole, greater amberjack and picarel are used). It was also eaten by the Romans in ancient Rome. \n\nIt is made by coating the fish (usually a white fish) in flour and deep-frying it in olive oil, then sprinkling it with salt as the only seasoning. It is usually served hot, freshly fried, and can be eaten as an appetizer (for example with a beer or wine), or as the main course. Usually, it is served with fresh lemon, which is squeezed over the fish or occasionally in escabeche.\n\nIt is also a traditional Shabbat fish dish (usually cod) originating amongst the 16th century Andalusian Jews of Spain and Portugal. The deep-frying of the fish in vegetable oil makes it crisp and light even when eaten cold, and it is a favourite dish for the late breakfast or lunch after synagogue services on Saturday morning.\n\nThere is a general belief that pescado frito was possibly an inspiration for the English fish and chips, brought to England by Spanish Jews; Sephardim began to settle in England in small numbers in the 16th century, and in larger numbers after Oliver Cromwell lifted the formal ban in the 1650s.\n\n"}

The pie is usually made with white, often smoked, fish (for example cod, haddock or halibut) in a white sauce or cheddar cheese sauce made using the milk the fish was poached in. Prawns and hard boiled eggs are other common additional ingredients. It is oven-baked in a deep dish but is not usually made with the shortcrust or puff pastry casing that is associated with most savoury pies (e.g. steak and kidney pie).\n\nIn place of a pastry casing enclosing the pie, a topping of mashed potatoes (sometimes with cheese or vegetables such as onions and leeks added) is used to cover the fish during baking. The dish is sometimes referred to as \"fisherman's pie\" because the topping is similar to that of shepherd's pie, in that it uses mashed potatoes.\n\nThe royal seafood tradition of England started in the time of Henry I, crowned in 1100, when cooks rolled crust over an annual Christmas lamprey pie. A separate tradition of Lenten fish pie required Yarmouth cooks to send the king two dozen pies containing 100 herrings. The customary gifts of fish in crust prevailed in 1530, when the prior of Llanthony, Gloucester, baked eels and carp into a pie for Henry VIII. The presentation of the royal eel pie continued in 1752, when bakers sent one to the Prince of Wales, and again during Queen Victoria's reign.\n\n\n\n"}

Letter sheets derive from the form in which written correspondence was made up before the mid-19th century — letters were written on one or more sheets of paper that were folded and sealed in such a way that the address could be written on the outside.\n\nThe term lettersheet has been used to describe the unstamped folded sheet letters used before envelopes became popular. Envelopes were not used much before the second half of the 19th century, because most countries' postal rates calculated for the extra sheet of paper that made up the envelope, thereby increasing the cost of mailing when an envelope was used.\n\nPre-paid lettersheets issued by postal operators are postal stationery because they bear imprinted stamps, or indicia that indicate pre-payment, as opposed to adhesive stamps that are only printed by postal authorities. Lettersheets that require stamps to be applied have also been produced by private firms that usually have no authority for a pre-paid indicia, so postage must be paid by normal means at normal postage rates. Most country's postal authorities have issued true lettersheets at some stage; however, most have discontinued their use, except in the form of an aerogram, due to the popularity of envelopes.\n\nThe first postal stationery item issued by a government is thought to be the AQ lettersheet issued in 1608 and showing the coat of arms of Venice. In 1790 Luxembourg produced a 25-centime lettersheet. British newspaper publishers printed colourful stamps on paper supplied by the government between 1712–1870 and Australia produced lettersheets two years before the Mulready lettersheets were issued in 1840. During this period envelopes were rarely used. New South Wales issued prepaid lettersheets in 1838 with uninked embossed stamps (making them difficult to see) to prepay postage within the town of Sydney.\n\nPrepaid lettersheets were introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at the same time as the first postage stamps were available for use on May 6, 1840. Part of Rowland Hill's postal reforms were the introduction of prepaid lettersheets and envelopes designed by the artist William Mulready, whose name is always associated with these first lettersheets and envelopes. In the same way that the first postage stamps were issued in two values (Penny Black and Two Penny Blue) both the lettersheets and envelopes were issued in one penny and two penny values in the same black and blue colours as the same value postage stamps.\n\nThe design incorporated Britannia at the centre top with a shield and a reclining lion surrounded on either side by a representation of the continents of Asia and North America with people reading their mail in the two lower corners. Rowland Hill expected the lettersheets to be more popular than the postage stamps but the postage stamp prevailed. Many caricatures were produced by stationery manufacturers whose livelihood was threatened by the new lettersheet. Only six days after their introduction, on May 12, Hill wrote in his journal:\n\nWithin two months a decision had been made to replace the Mulready designed stationery and essentially they were a folly.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, in August 1861, two different size lettersheets were issued by the United States which both had the same three cents imprinted stamp design. The small pink indicium on light blue note lettersheet (205 x 296 mm) was for ladies correspondence and the larger size (256 x 405 mm) was designed for soldiers, ostensibly as a convenient writing paper without the added burden of securing stamps. The suggested use, though practical, did not materialize and they were withdrawn from sales in April 1864.\n\nDespite the abortive attempt to popularize lettersheets in 1861, two cent lettersheets with a picture of President Ulysses Grant were issued on August 18, 1886. They were last produced in 1894, but slow sales of lettersheets continued until 1902. The US has not produced any since, other than air letter sheets or aerograms which became available in 1947 and were likewise discontinued in 2006.\n\nPrivately produced pictorial lettersheets were published by several stationers in New York City and other cities. These lettersheets, predominantly showing bird's-eye views and street scenes, were created to comply with, yet circumvent, postal regulations that, like the United Kingdom's, were based on the number of sheets of paper. These lettersheets were popular because of their 8.5 × 21 inch size that could be folded in half, providing four pages for writing but the Post Office regarded them as one sheet of paper.\n\nSpecial stationery on thin sheets of paper, called \"Air Letter Cards\" were available in Iraq as early as 1933. The sheets were folded to the size of the blue border, and gummed flaps were used to seal the sheet. Douglas Gumbley, director of Posts to the Iraq Government in the 1930s, realised there was a need for a lightweight form for use in the developing air services in, and through, the Middle East because regular overland mail was charged by weight and varied in size and seemed likely to be too expensive for airmail service. He personally copyrighted the product in February 1933 and it was used first in Iraq and later in the British Mandate of Palestine where Gumbley was in charge of postal matters in the late 1930s.\nIn early 1941 the United Kingdom introduced thin, lightweight forms intended for use by their overseas military forces. Known as air letter sheets, they took up much less space than regular letters, and by August the use of these sheets was extended to civilians. Allied POW communications through the Red Cross used a special lettersheet inscribed \"Prisoner of War Air Mail\" in English and German or Japanese with a 2½d indicia. The Forces air lettersheets were rated at 3d while the civilian version was imprinted with a 6d stamp.\n\nSeveral other countries adapted the British lettersheet model during the war, while many other countries introduced them after the war. Curiously, the British 6d air letter rate remained in effect until 1966 while other postal rates increased.\n\nSome German POW and concentration camps issued their own special lettersheets for use by the inmates. Towards the end of WWII, at least eight forged German Feldpost lettersheets were printed by the OSS Operation Cornflakes to undermine Axis morale during late 1944 and 1945.\n\nThe aerogram, also written aérogramme, aerogramme, or airletter, also made from a lightweight paper, is the modern equivalent of the WWII lettersheet and most postal operators issue them prepaid, though Ireland, New Zealand and Rhodesia have issued them without an indicium requiring the addition of a postage stamp before mailing.\n\nThe Universal Postal Union adopted the term \"aérogramme\", the French word for air letter, during the 1951–52 13th Postal Union Congress held in Brussels and all countries inscribe this on their air mail lettersheets except for the United Kingdom which still uses the term \"Air Letter\".\n\nNot all lettersheets are aerograms, however. Cuba, for instance, has issued a number of colorful lettersheets that were designed for internal, non-airmail, use in Cuba.\n\n"}

In both English, and the Goidelic languages, the word was borrowed in the sense of a monastic cell. In English, the word \"cell\" has also taken on the additional meaning of a room in a prison.\n\nThe word, in its various forms, can be found in Irish and Scottish Gaelic too. It is often anglicised in Scotland and Ireland as \"Kil-\" e.g. Kilmarnock, Kildare etc.\n\nColumba is known as \"Columb Killey\", where \"killey\" is the genitive of \"keeill\" in Manx. Calum Cille etc. in the other Goidelic languages.\n\nArchaeologically, it is used for a specific type of small simple chapel found on the Isle of Man and built between the 6th and 12th centuries. Some similar sites have been identified on Islay and Gallarus Oratory.\n\nThe earliest versions of the structures are all thought to have been lost, and only their later replacements (mostly in use between the 8th and 12th centuries) survive. These survivors vary in size and arrangement, and include examples constructed in unhewn or roughly worked stones, stone-revetted turf and timber-laced rubble. Beneath some sites remnants of clay daub have been found (Megaw 1978:298), while traces of wall plaster have also been discovered. Keeills may have fallen out of use following the arrival of Viking settlers on the Island, but were then re-established, on the same sites in some cases, once the Vikings had converted to Christianity.\n\nA number of keeills were built on a natural or artificial mound, often the site of earlier burials or monuments (e.g. Bronze-Age barrow mounds) (Lowe and Reilly 1988) and/or near a spring or holy well (a chibbyr). Many keeills are surrounded by cemeteries, some of which may have originated in pagan society. Some keeills are enclosed by a turf bank. The area of ground bounded by such a bank can vary considerably and may represent earlier, pre-Christian use.\n\nAt least 174 keeills have been recorded on the Island, out of probably over 200, though only 35 can be easily identified today. Records are made up of extant sites, potential remains, place-name records and folk memory. The nature of some of this evidence is sufficient to cast doubt on the reliability of the total record. Most of the sites have either been lost (\"e.g.\" when a later medieval church such as Kirk Maughold or Kirk Christ Malew was built on top of or in place of one), or destroyed when excavated by Victorian and Edwardian antiquarians looking for ground plans and treasure rather than stratigraphy and finds.\n\nWe do know that while different keeills were broadly similar in their layout they varied considerably in size.\n\nCarl J. S. Marstrander, a Norwegian professor who carried out what remains the most extensive survey of keeills on the Isle of Man in the 1930s, described this variation: \n\nMarstrander's inclusion of the notably larger structures he mentions here is now deprecated, in view of their later date.\n\nDetailed work drawing comparisons with sites in the Northern Isles has been undertaken by Lowe (1987), and with those on Islay, by Swift (1987).\n\nThe keeill excavated in 2007 by \"Time Team\" fitted into Marstrander's general pattern, in terms of walls, rectangular shape, lack of identifiable internal divisions, and having a single narrow entrance and an eastern altar.\n\n\n\n"}

The traditional dish is usually served along with boiled potatoes as an accompaniment for pork chops, pork cutlets or other pork dishes, veal and game meats. In some homes, kapusta is served very thin, almost like a soup. In others, its ingredients are thickened with flour or cooked until it becomes nearly as thick as mashed potatoes. It has been described as less sour in flavor compared to German sauerkraut.\n\nCabbage, the primary ingredient, is often pickled, like sauerkraut, which is amplified with a mix of mushrooms and onions and meat—fatty pork—either rib meat, bacon, or occasionally smoked kielbasa.

They were first observed in the early 1940s. They consist of protons, electrons and HZE ions with energy ranging from a few tens of keV to many GeV (the fastest particles can approach the speed of light, as in a \"ground-level event\"). They are of particular interest and importance because they can endanger life in outer space (especially particles above 40 MeV).\n\nSolar energetic particles can originate either from a solar-flare site or by shock waves associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, only about 1% of CMEs produce strong SEP events.\n\nSEPs are also of interest because they provide a good sample of solar material. Despite the nuclear fusion occurring in the core, the majority of solar material is representative of the material that formed the solar system. By studying SEP's isotopic composition, scientists can indirectly measure the material that formed the solar system.\n\nTwo main mechanisms of acceleration are possible: diffusive shock acceleration (DSA, an example of second-order Fermi acceleration) or the shock-drift mechanism. SEPs can be accelerated to energies of several tens of MeV within 5–10 solar radii (5% of the Sun–Earth distance) and can reach Earth in a few minutes in extreme cases. This makes prediction and warning of SEP events quite challenging.\n\n\n\n"}

Myth has it that Suchandra and Krita, a married couple, first experimented with fresh yield of rice from their field. And what took shape came to be known as Yamari. The new delicacy was eventually distributed among the villagers. As the food was liked by all, the bread was named Yamari, which literally means 'tasty bread'.\n\nThe myth further states that on the same day the couple offered the god of wealth, Kubera, who was passing by in a disguise, the new delicacy. Following this, Kubera disclosed his real identity and blessed the couple with wealth. He also declared that whoever will prepare Yamari in the form of gods and goddesses on the full moon of December and observe four days of devotion to god, will get rid of poverty.\n\nThe festival of Yomari punhi is celebrated on the second day of the full moon when prayers are offered during which the Yomaris are stored and not eaten on that very day. On the fourth and the final day the people belonging to the Newa community consume the sweet bread as a gift from gods and this practice also marks the end of the festival.\n\n\n"}

Wiser's Whisky is Canada's oldest continuously produced Canadian whisky. The brand was established in 1857, and Hiram Walker & Sons Limited currently produces it at their Windsor, Ontario, distillery. Since 1935, they have been the majority shareholder of Corby Spirit and Wine. Both companies came into ownership of international liquor company Pernod Ricard in 2005.\n\nJohn Philip (J.P.) Wiser was born in 1825 in New York. He was the son of Isaac J. Wiser and Mary Egert. In 1857, Wiser began running the Charles Payne Distillery and Farm in Prescott, Ontario, which was owned by his uncle, Charles Egert, and his uncle's business partner, Amos Averell.\n\nFive years after starting as manager of the distillery, Wiser bought out Egert and Averell to become its sole owner, which was producing 116,500 gallons of whisky a year. Wiser introduced his first bottles of whisky at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Prior to this time, whisky was only sold in casks or barrels. By the time of the U.S. Civil War, J.P. Wiser's Red Letter Rye was sold in Canada, and J.P. Wiser's Canada Whisky was available for export. Wiser's son, Harlow, operated the distillery to an output of 500,000 gallons a year until he died at the age of 36 from a heart attack in 1895.\n\nBy the early 1900s, J.P. Wiser was exporting whisky around the world, and his distillery in Prescott became the third largest in Canada behind Hiram Walker's in Windsor and Gooderham & Worts' in Toronto. Wiser died in 1911, and the distillery was taken over by Albert Whitney, a treasurer who had worked at the distillery for over 50 years.\n\nThe company struggled after the death of J.P Wiser, and at the end of World War I, J.P. Wiser's was sold and merged with Corby, J.M. Douglas and Company Limited and Robert MacNish and Co. Limited of Scotland. In 1935, the company merged with Hiram Walker.\n\nNewest Label Launches\n\nIn keeping with market trends, Wiser's Spiced was launched in fall 2012. Wiser's Small Batch was also launched to replace Wiser's Reserve, with upgraded packaging and advertising. In September 2013, Wiser's Red Letter was re-introduced to celebrate J.P. Wiser's 150th anniversary.\nJ.P. Wiser's in the U.S.\n\nJ.P. Wiser's Rye and J.P. Wiser's Spiced whisky were introduced to the U.S. market in October 2013.\n\nThe J.P. Wiser's brand is advertised with a quote from J.P. Wiser, saying \"Quality is something you just can't rush. Horses should hurry, but whisky must take its time.\"\n\n2014\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\nIn 2008, Wiser's introduced the \"Wiserhood\" campaign created by John St. advertising from Toronto. The campaign focuses on The Wiserhood, the \"Society of Uncompromising Men\", represented by a group of dapper men who recognize a small victory for men everywhere.\n\nThe campaign resumed in 2010, introducing a \"Slow Clap App\" and more TV spots. After three years, the Wiserhood took a hiatus.\n\nIn 2013, Wiser's launched a modified version of the campaign with social media components. \"Wiser's Wants You!\" is a Facebook-hosted contest that encouraged entrants to audition for a role in a Wiserhood TV spot.\n\nAn article published by The Globe and Mail on April 7, 2011 described a back-and-forth between Michael Bliss (Order of Canada, Royal Society of Canada) and Corby Spirit & Wine president, Patrick O'Driscoll. Allegedly, Bliss said a Wiserhood commercial (in which a bored man on a date at an art gallery begins touching fine art in order to get kicked out of the gallery) was tasteless and suggested it contravened the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards by encouraging the desecration of art. O'Driscoll replied it was intended to be humorous and outlined Corby's support of Canada's artistic community.\n\nHiram Walker & Sons Distillery\n\nSince the 1980s, J.P. Wiser's Whisky has been distilled and bottled at the Hiram-Walker & Sons distillery in Windsor, ON and aged in the Pike Creek area of Lakeshore. Hiram Walker & Sons has the largest distillery capacity in North America with 39 fermenters, producing approximately 55 million liters of absolute alcohol and 60 - 70% of all Canadian whisky. About 75% of this whisky is sold to independent bottlers in Canada and abroad.\n\nThe manufacturing process distils 180,000 litres of alcohol every 24 hours and operates 24 hours a day, five days a week and every second weekend to produce a variety of alcohol products. In a year, the facilities handle more than five million cases of spirits. Hiram Walker & Sons holds 1.6 million barrels of spirits in their maturing warehouse, which are blended and eventually bottled on four high-speed lines. The distillery is the only \"grain to glass\" distillery in Ontario, with over 50 bottle molds available.\n\nIn recent years, the distillery has launched environmental initiatives, including reducing the amount of water diverted to waste by 60%, reducing waste water contaminant by 90% and reducing overall energy consumption by 40%.\n\n\nJ.P. Wiser had high standards for his signature product, aiming to refine the process for making Canadian whisky and raise above the impure and under-aged whiskies of the time. He soon became known for being blended with exacting care and aged to perfection in white oak barrels.\n\nCanada's Food and Drugs Act requires whisky labeled as \"Canadian Whisky\" be mashed, distilled and aged three years in wooden casks of less than 700 L. Due to the openness of this definition, a Master Blender is free to be innovative in comparison to other whiskies around the world. Today, J.P. Wiser's follows a process similar in tradition to that established from J.P. Wiser's original whiskies:\n\n\nDr. Don Livermore has been the J.P. Wiser's Master Blender since early 2012. He took over from his mentor, former Master Blender David Doyle—with whom he helped influence the J.P. Wiser's Legacy label. After beginning his career with Hiram Walker and Sons Ltd. as a microbiologist in quality assurance, Livermore worked in research and product development for 11 years. He obtained his BSc in microbiology at the University of Waterloo and earned a MSc and a PhD in Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University.\n\nDave Mitton is the co-owner of The Harbord Room, a Toronto bar he opened in 2007 with partners Chris Shiki and Cory Vitiello. In 2012, they expanded operations to include its sister restaurant, THR & Co.

The main ingredients are grape must, nuts and flour. Almonds, walnuts, hazelnut and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.\n\nChurchkhela and its varieties are popular in several countries besides Georgia, such as Iran, Armenia, Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey. In Persian, it's known as \"Lævascæck Adjili\" (لواشک آجیلی). In Armenian, Greek, and Turkish it is known as \"sujuk\", which is actually a dry sausage. To distinguish the two, it is sometimes referred to as \"sweet sujukh\" (քաղցր սուջուխ, \"kaghtsr sujukh\") in Armenian and \"cevizli sucuk\" (\"walnut sujuk\") in Turkish. It is known in Cypriot Greek as \"soutzoukos\" (\"σουτζούκος\" or \"σουτζιούκκος\") and as \"soutzouki\" (σουτζούκι) in Greece. The Cypriot variety is made by dipping strings of almonds into jelly, called palouzes or moustalevria.\n\nChurchkhela is a homemade Georgian product. Georgians usually make Churchkhela in Autumn when the primary ingredients, grapes and nuts, are harvested. It is a string of walnut halves that have been dipped in grape juice called Tatara or Phelamushi (grape juice thickened with flour), and dried in the sun. No sugar is added to make real Churchkhela. Instead of walnuts, sometimes hazelnuts or almonds are used in the regions of west Georgia.\nThe shape of Churchkhela looks like a candle. Georgian warriors carried Churchkhelas with them because they contain many calories. The best Churchkhela is made in Kakheti region, which is renowned as the motherland of wine.\n\nThe juice is placed in a large bronze cauldron and heated slowly. A small amount of a special white earth called \"asproi\" is added to the boiling must and causes impurities to rise to the surface, where they are collected and removed. It is possible to substitute \"asproi\", when not available, with lager beer, which has a similar result. Once the cleansing process is complete, the liquid is left to cool. Next, flour is added while stirring and heating the mixture. When it reaches the right consistency, based on the rate of steam bubbles and the viscosity of the mixture, it is removed from the heat. The mix, called \"Badagi\", is now ready for use in the next step in the process of making Churchkhelas, which consists of preparing the nuts for dipping.\n\nBefore they are threaded, the nuts have to be shelled and dipped into water in order to soften them. Once soft enough, they are strung onto 2-3 meter-long threads. The strings are dipped in the \"Badagi\" mixture until completely covered. This process is repeated several times (usually three times) until the Churchkhelas has the desired thickness. Churchkhelas strings are then left to dry for 5–6 days. They are then ready for consumption or storage, even though some people like to eat it fresh.\n\nChurchkhela is a snack for in-between and is also served as a dessert during the New Year and Christmas celebrations.\n\n"}

This method of meat production is a variant of methods such as the kosher (shechita) and halal (dhabihah) methods, which include a prayer before the strike.\n\n\"Jhatka\" is the method of meat production demanded by many Hindus, Sikhs, and denominational Christians, while Halal is demanded by Muslims, and Kosher by Jews.\n\n\"Jhatka\" ( \"\" ; ) is derived from Sanskrit word \"Jhatiti\" (झटिति) which means \"instantly, quickly, at once\".\n\nJhatka meat is mandated for Sikhs by the tenth Guru:\nAs stated in the official Khalsa Code of Conduct, Kutha meat is forbidden, and Sikhs are recommended to eat the jhatka form of meat.\n\nFor Sikhs, \"jhatka karna\" or \"jhatkaund\" refers to the instantaneous severing of the head of an animal with a single stroke of any weapon, with the underlying intention of killing the animal whilst causing it minimal suffering. The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair-cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the consumption of kutha meat (halal meat).\n\nDuring the British Raj, jhatka meat was not allowed in jails, and Sikh detainees during the Akali movement and beyond had to resort to violence and agitations to secure this right. Among the terms in the settlement between the Akalis and the Muslim Unionist government in Punjab in 1942 was that jhatka meat be continued as a Sikh Martial Heritage.\n\nOn religious Sikh festivals, including Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi, at the Hazur Sahib Nanded, and many other Sikh Gurdwaras, jhatka meat is offered as \"mahaprasad\" to all visitors in a Gurdwara.Though, this practice is considered to be wrong and not acceptable by major sikhs as only lacto-vegetarian langar is supposed to be served inside gurudwaras.\n\nSome Sikh Organizations, such as the Damdami Taksal and Akhand Kirtani Jatha, have their own codes of conduct. These organizations define kutha meat as any type of slaughtered meat, and eating meat of any type is forbidden.\n\nIn the diversity of Hinduism, many Hindus are vegetarians from their belief in Ahimsa (non-injury, non-violence), and to minimize suffering to all life forms, but there is no binding religious dietary law in Hinduism, and the choice is left to the Hindu. Many Shaivite and Shakta Hindus, for example, offer meat and liquor as part of certain ritual worship, and then consume the meat. Hindus who eat meat seek jhatka meat.\n\nAll three methods use sharp knives. In the Shechita and Halal method, the animal is slaughtered by one swift, uninterrupted cut severing the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, and vagus nerves, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out. In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the head and the spine. In the Halal method, a prayer to God (Allah) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during \"Shchita\" meat production, but before every slaughter in \"Halal\" meat production.\n\nIn India, there are many jhatka shops, with various bylaws requiring shops to display clearly that they sell jhatka meat.\n\nIn the past, there has been little availability of jhatka meat in the United Kingdom, so people have found themselves eating other types of meat, although jhatka has become more widely available in the United Kingdom.\n"}

The energies these particles possess are in excess of 10 eV.\n\nUnlike solar or galactic cosmic rays, little is known about the origins of extragalactic cosmic rays. This is largely due to a lack of statistics: only about 1 extragalactic cosmic ray particle per square meter per year reaches the Earth's surface (see figure).\n\nThere are many ideas about which processes may be responsible for cosmic rays with such high energies. In the 'bottom-up' approach, cosmic rays gain more and more energy through electromagnetic processes. Bouncing randomly back and forth in the shock waves of some violent object allows some of the particles to gain energy. Eventually they may build up enough speed that the object can no longer contain them, and they escape. Proposed sites for this type of acceleration include gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Indeed, recent analysis of cosmic ray measurements with the Pierre Auger Observatory suggests a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays of the highest energies of more than 5×10 eV and the positions of nearby active galaxies.\n\nThere are many more possible sources scientists are considering. These include colliding galaxy systems, accretion flow shocks to clusters of galaxies, and more exotic processes from the very early universe, such as the decay of superheavy particles trapped in the galactic halo, or topological defects.\n\nDue to the very low flux of extragalactic cosmic particles received on Earth, little is known about their composition. Most estimates, based on theoretical and numerical models, predict that light atomic nuclei such as protons are the dominant particle type.\n\n\n"}

It is currently available in blue as Rev Energy and Rev Low. It is also available in pink and yellow. Purple, red, and green have been discontinued. The drink is sold in packs of four 330 mL bottles and single 473 mL bottles.\n\nRev was introduced in April, 2000, as a beverage marketed towards rave and nightclub culture.\n\nRev is sold in tall slender plastic bottles which can be resealed.\n\nRev when combined with Jägermeister makes a drink called a \"Rev-Bomb\", a variation of a Jägerbomb. This drink is a \"depth charge\" or \"bomb shot\", which refers to cocktails that are made by dropping a shot glass filled with liquor into another drink.\n\nIn Southern Saskatchewan, the term \"Rev-Bomb\" is used to describe the act of piercing the bottom of the bottle with a knife, covering the hole, then opening the top and chugging the entirety of the drink. This is a form of shotgunning.\n\nA Rev-Bomb is usually sold with a bottle of Rev, half of which is poured into a pint glass and separately accompanied by Jägermeister in a shot glass. The glass of Jägermeister is then dropped into the Rev.\n\nThe effects of a Rev-Bomb are held to be similar to those of a Jägerbomb, which differ from the effects of other alcoholic drinks. This is attributed to the fact that Rev is similar to an energy drink and has a stimulating effect upon the central nervous system, whereas the alcohol has a depressing effect. Consequently, some of the effects of intoxication are masked.\n\nA Brazilian study conducted in 2006 found that combining energy drinks and alcohol \"appears to show us that the use of energy drinks might predispose people to abuse alcohol when its depressant effects — or at least the perception of such effects — are masked by them.\" Professor Roseli Boergnen de Lacerda, who conducted the study, also warned of another possible effect: \"a higher risk of car accidents because they [people who drank energy drinks with alcohol] felt less intoxicated than they were.\"\n\nA further concern is the effect that the stimulant-depressant combination has upon the heart. Alcohol can reduce brain activity, impair heart function, and lead to a heart attack. When combined with an energy drink, its effects may include cardiovascular risks, shortness of breath, and rapid heartbeat. The body’s defenses are weakened by the dehydration caused by the alcohol and caffeine, both of which are diuretics.\n\n"}

This includes all levels of play including Little League World Series, high school, college (NCAA) and professional teams (e.g. NBA Finals or Stanley Cup).\n\nThe tradition began with the New York Giants football team in the mid-1980s. According to several sources, including Jim Burt of the Giants, it began on October 28, 1984, when the Giants beat the Washington Redskins 37–13, and Burt performed the action on Bill Parcells after being angry over the coach's treatment of him that week. Burt insisted that Harry Carson dumped the Gatorade on Parcells, because Carson was a favorite and wouldn't get in trouble. Former Chicago Bears defensive tackle Dan Hampton claims he invented the shower, also in 1984, when the Bears dunked Mike Ditka upon clinching the NFC Central – but that took place a month later in November. The phenomenon gained national attention in the 1986 Giants season. Parcells was doused after 17 victories that season, culminating with Super Bowl XXI.\n\nBoston Celtics coach Doc Rivers was reported to be the first NBA coach to receive a Gatorade shower when his team won the 2008 NBA Finals. Paul Pierce dumped a cooler of red Gatorade over Rivers as the Celtics closed out Game 6 to clinch their first NBA title in 22 years. Then-Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson is the only NBA head coach to receive a Gatorade shower twice, as the Lakers won back-to-back NBA Finals in 2009 (at Amway Arena in Orlando, Florida) and 2010. Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle likewise received the honors when Mavericks celebrated their first NBA championship in 2011. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra received the same treatment from Udonis Haslem when the Heat won the 2012 NBA Finals at the American Airlines Arena in 2012.\n\nGeorge Allen, coach of the Long Beach State football team and a former Hall of Fame NFL head coach, was doused with ice water from a Gatorade bucket as his team celebrated its victory over the University of Nevada on November 17, 1990. Allen became ill shortly afterward and died of ventricular fibrillation six weeks later.\n\nKentucky Wildcats coach Guy Morriss is one of few coaches ever to receive a Gatorade shower and lose a game. This occurred on November 9, 2002, during the Bluegrass Miracle, when LSU defeated Kentucky. Coach Morriss was showered immediately before Marcus Randall threw a Hail Mary pass to Devery Henderson to win on the final play of the game. On November 24, 2018, LSU coach Ed Orgeron received a gatorade shower after an apparent LSU game ending interception. Texas A&M eventually beat LSU 74-72 in 7 overtimes.\n\nMany baseball players give a teammate who has just hit a walk-off home run, or a pitcher who has thrown a no-hitter, a Gatorade shower while they are giving a post-game interview on the field. Salvador Pérez of the Kansas City Royals is known for giving a Gatorade shower to teammates after every home win and notable away wins. Other times, baseball players receive a cream pie to the face in lieu of a Gatorade shower.\n\nThe Australian NRL rugby league club Melbourne Storm's players have given their coach, Craig Bellamy, a Gatorade shower every time they have won the premiership under him, including in 2007, 2009 and 2012.\n\nIn the AFL, players are customarily given a shower if they win in their first game with their club.\n\nIn cricket the Australian cricket team players gave their coach Darren Lehmann a Gatorade shower on two occasions, during post celebrations after his team won the 2013-14 Ashes series and during a post match interview after the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final.\n\nIn 2016, the coach of Brazilian team SE Palmeiras received a Gatorade Shower during his first interview after receiving the 2016 Brasileirão title, also was the first time known that someone received a Gatorade shower in first division of Brazilian soccer ,the team did again after 2018 title.\n\nMany teams do not use Gatorade but instead use water or another substitute; for example, the Florida State Seminoles use Powerade, due to their sponsorship agreement with Powerade manufacturer The Coca-Cola Company and Gatorade's affiliation with rival University of Florida. After Michigan State University's win over Penn State in 2010, Spartan players dumped a Gatorade bucket filled with green and white confetti on head coach Mark Dantonio. This was done because of the cold temperature and Dantonio's heart condition.\n\nThe tradition has become a mainstay of the Super Bowl; so much so that numerous gambling websites have established various 'prop bets' on situations during the game.\n\nAs the tradition has evolved, not all showers are reserved for championship games. Gatorade showers have occurred after key victories that were not championship games, after the defeat of a rival, after the snapping of a losing streak, or after the snapping of an opponent's winning streak.\n\nGenerally, it happens during an interview. Sometimes, the \"victim\" is the journalist. Another variation is shaving cream on the face, with a towel.\n\nIn 2005, ESPN sports business writer Darren Rovell published a book entitled \"First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat into a Cultural Phenomenon\", in which he documented, among other things, the story behind the Gatorade dunking phenomenon.\n\n\n"}

The twelve leeches are kept in small bottles inside the device; when they become agitated by an approaching storm they attempt to climb out of the bottles and trigger a small hammer which strikes a bell. The likelihood of a storm is indicated by the number of times the bell is struck.\n\nDr. Merryweather, honorary curator of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society's Museum, detailed the sensitivity that medicinal leeches displayed in reaction to electrical conditions in the atmosphere. He was inspired by two lines from Edward Jenner's poem \"Signs of Rain\": \"The leech disturbed is newly risen; Quite to the summit of his prison.\" Merryweather spent much of 1850 developing his ideas and came up with six designs for what he originally referred to as \"An Atmospheric Electromagnetic Telegraph, conducted by Animal Instinct.\" These ranged from a cheap version, which he envisaged would be used by the government and the shipping industries, to a more expensive design. The expensive design, which took inspiration from the architecture of Indian temples, was made by local craftsmen and shown in the 1851 Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace in London.\n\nOn 27 February 1851 he gave a nearly three-hour essay to members of the Philosophical Society entitled \"Essay explanatory of the Tempest Prognosticator in the building of the Great Exhibition for the Works of Industry of All Nations.\"\n\nThe tempest prognosticator comprises twelve pint bottles in a circle around and beneath a large bell. Atop the glasses are small metal tubes which contain a piece of whalebone and a wire connecting them to small hammers positioned to strike the bell. In his essay Merryweather described the workings of the device:\nThe leech would have difficulty entering the metal tubes but would endeavour to do so if sufficiently motivated by the likelihood of bad weather. By ringing the bell it would signify that that individual leech is indicating that a storm is approaching. Merryweather referred to the leeches as his \"jury of philosophical councilors\" and that the more of them that rang the bell the more likely that a storm would occur.\n\nIn his essay Merryweather also noted other features of the design, including the fact that the leeches were placed in glass bottles placed in a circle to prevent them from feeling \"the affliction of solitary confinement\".\n\nMerryweather spent all of 1850 testing the device, sending a letter to the president of the Philosophical Society and the Whitby Institute, Henry Belcher, to warn him of an impending storm. The results of 28 of these predictions are kept in the library of Whitby Museum. Merryweather stated in his essay the great success that he had had with the device.\n\nMerryweather lobbied for the government to make use of his design around the British coastline but they instead opted for Robert FitzRoy's storm glass.\n\nThe original device has been lost, but at least three replicas have been made. The hundredth anniversary of the invention brought renewed interest as a replica was made for the 1951 Festival of Britain. This non-working version was made from the description in a printed copy of Merryweather's essay and a copperplate drawing of the original. The device was shown in the Dome of Discovery and given to the Whitby Philosophical Society when the festival ended. Plans and photographs of this replica were then used to create faithful working models, one at Barometer World near Okehampton, Devon, and another at the Great Dickens Christmas Fair in San Francisco.\n\n\n"}

That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners include definite and indefinite articles (like the English \"the\" and \"a\" or \"an\"), demonstratives (\"this\" and \"that\"), possessive determiners (\"my\" and \"their\"), quantifiers (\"many\", \"few\" and \"several\"), numerals, distributive determiners (\"each\", \"any\"), and interrogative determiners (\"which\").\n\nFor examples of determiners and use, see the box on the use in English, English determiners.\n\nMost determiners have been traditionally classed along with either adjectives or pronouns, and this still occurs in classical grammars: for example, demonstrative and possessive determiners are sometimes described as \"demonstrative adjectives\" and \"possessive adjectives\" or as \"(adjectival) demonstrative pronouns\" and \"(adjectival) possessive pronouns\" respectively. These classical interpretations of determiners map to some of the linguistic properties related to determiners in modern syntax theories, such as deictic information, definiteness and genitivity. However, modern theorists of grammar prefer to distinguish determiners as a separate word class from adjectives, which are simple modifiers of nouns, expressing attributes of the thing referred to. This distinction applies particularly in languages like English that use definite and indefinite articles, frequently as a necessary component of noun phrases – the determiners may then be taken to be a class of words that includes the articles as well as other words that function in the place of articles. (The composition of this class may depend on the particular language's rules of syntax; for example, in English the possessives \"my\", \"your\" etc. are used without articles and so can be regarded as determiners, whereas their Italian equivalents \" etc. are used together with articles and so may be better classed as adjectives.) Not all languages can be said to have a lexically distinct class of determiners.\n\nIn some languages, the role of certain determiners can be played by affixes (prefixes or suffixes) attached to a noun or by other types of inflection. For example, definite articles are represented by suffixes in Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Swedish. (For example, in Swedish, ' (\"book\"), when definite, becomes ' (\"the book\"), while the Romanian \" (\"notebook\") similarly becomes \"caietul\" (\"the notebook\").) Some languages, such as Finnish, have possessive affixes, which play the role of possessive determiners like \"my\" and \"his\".\nSome theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. For further information, see .\n\nUniversal Grammar is the theory that all humans are born equipped with grammar, and all languages share certain properties. There are arguments that determiners are not a part of Universal Grammar and are instead part of an emergent syntactic category. This has been shown through the studies of some languages' histories, including Dutch.\n\nDeterminers may be subcategorized as predeterminers, central determiners and postdeterminers, based on the order in which they can occur. For example, \"all my many very young children\" uses one of each. \"My all many very young children\" is ungrammatical because a central determiner cannot precede a predeterminer.\n\nAn article is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. Some example of articles are \"a\", \"an\", \"the\".\n\nDemonstratives are words, such as \"this\" and \"that\", used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. They are usually deictic, which means their meaning changes with context.\n\nPossessive determiners modify a noun by attributing possession (or other sense of belonging) to someone or something, and usually reflect the noun's genitive case. They are also known as possessive adjectives.\n\nQuantifiers indicate quantity. Some examples of quantifiers include: \"all\", \"some\", \"many\", \"few\", and \"no\". Quantifiers are also dependent of a noun. It is important to acknowledge that quantifiers only indicate a vague quantity of objects, not a specific number, such as \"twelve\", \"dozen\", \"first\", \"single\", or \"once\", which would be considered numerals.\n\nDistributive determiners, also called distributive adjectives, consider members of a group separately, rather than collectively. Words such as \"each\", \"any\", \"either\", and \"neither\" are examples of distributive determiners. This type of determiner also depends on a noun. These determiners are not to be confused with distributive pronouns, which can operate without a noun.\n\n\nInterrogatives are used to ask a question, such as \"which\", \"what\", and \"whose\" (personal possessive determiner). These determiners also depend on a noun.\n\nSome modern grammatical approaches regard determiners (rather than nouns) as the head of their phrase and thus refer to such phrases as determiner phrases rather than noun phrases. Under this assumption, every noun in a syntax tree is dominated by a determiner. There are many examples in natural language where nouns appear without a determiner, yet in determiner phrase grammars there must still be a determiner. To account for this, syntacticians consider the head of the determiner phrase to be an unpronounced null determiner. These grammar theories are either based on X-bar theory or descend from it, which requires that every noun has a corresponding determiner (or specifier). In the cases where a noun does not have an explicit determiner (as in \"physics uses mathematics\"), X-bar theory hypothesizes the presence of a zero article, or zero determiner, an X-bar specific form of the null determiner. Noun phrases that contain only a noun and do not have a determiner present are known as bare noun phrases. For more detail on theoretical approaches to the status of determiners, see .\n\nUnder the Universal Grammar theory, most facets of language are inherent, and only idiosyncrasies of languages are learned. Notice that determiners and subsequently their phrases would have to inherently be part of Universal Grammar in order for Determiner Phrase theory and Universal Grammar theory to coexist.\n\nSome theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. See Pronoun: Theoretical considerations. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase.\n\n\n"}

Nachzehrer translates \"after (\"nach\") living off (\"zehren\")\" likely alluding to their living after death or living off humans after death in addition to the choice of \"nach\" for \"after\" which is similar to \"nacht\" (\"night\"). The nachzehrer was prominent in the folklore of the northern regions of Germany, but even in Silesia and Bavaria, and the word was also used to describe a similar creature of the Kashubes of Northern Poland.\n\nA Nachzehrer is created most commonly after suicide, and sometimes from an accidental death. According to German lore, a person does not become a nachzehrer from being bitten or scratched; the transformation happens after death and is not communicable. Nachzehrers are also related to sickness and disease. If a large group of people died of the plague, the first person to have died is believed to be a nachzehrer.\n\nTypically, a nachzehrer devours its family members upon waking. It has also been said that they devour their own bodies, including their funeral shrouds, and the more of themselves they eat, the more of their family they physically drain. It is not unlikely that the idea of the dead eating themselves might have risen from bodies in open graves who had been partly eaten by scavengers like rats. \n\nThe nachzehrer was similar to the Slavic vampire in that it was known to be a recently deceased person who returned from the grave to attack family and village acquaintances. \n\nIt usually originated from an unusual death such as a person who died by suicide or accident. They were also associated with epidemic sickness, such as whenever a group of people died from the same disease, the person who died first was labeled to be the cause of the group's death. Another belief was that if a person's name was not removed from his burial clothing, that person would be a candidate for becoming a nachzehrer.\n\nSuch a belief was found even in the Republic of Venice, where the body of a woman, with a brick in her mouth, was recently discovered in a mass grave of plague-dead people.\n\nThe official killing myth says you can kill a nachzehrer by placing a coin in its mouth, and then chopping off its head. It can be discerned from this that a mere coin in the mouth may result in paralysis as some myths say that a stake through a vampires heart does. \n\nFinding nachzehrer in order to kill them is not difficult; it is characteristic of a nachzehrer to lie in its grave with its thumb in its opposite hand, and its left eye open. Additionally, they are easily found while eating their burial shroud due to the volume they produce in this act. \n\n"}

In Turkey it is made all the year and served especially during Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, as the 10th of Muharrem corresponds to the Day of Ashure. (\"Ashura\" means \"tenth\" in Arabic.) \n\nAshure is one of the limited set of Turkish desserts which contain no animal products. One reason behind it is arguably protesting all kinds of violence and bloodshed. Alevis in Turkey are the prominent group to promote this pudding, traditionally cooking and sharing it following the days of fasting (coinciding Battle of Karbala) in which they abstain from eating meat. In said battle, Hussein ibn Ali and his followers were murdered.\n\nTraditionally, Ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, among others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year as it is calorie rich fare, but now it is enjoyed year-round.\n\nThe word Ashure come from Arabic word Ashura \"\". It means tenth. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. Not only Islamic believing, but also pre-islamic believes related with some semitic stories also connected by Muharram month.\n\nAlso in Turkish, Ash(Aş) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \"Ashur\" meaning mixing. Evliya Çelebi defines the Ashure in his travelbook, \"Ashure is a porridge (aş) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\" \n\nAshure porridge does not have a single recipe, as recipes vary between regions and families.\n\nTraditionally, it is said to have at least seven ingredients. Some say at least ten ingredients in keeping with the theme of \"tenth\", while Alevis always use twelve. Among these are wheat, rice, beans, chick peas, sugar (or other sweetener), dried fruits, and nuts, though there are many variants. However, many renditions add orange and lemon peel to add depth to the pudding. sesame seeds, pomegranate kernels, and cinnamon may be used as garnish, and some variations are flavored with rose water. \n\nIn most cases, it is vegan, and it is one of the well-known and the most popular vegan desserts in Turkish cuisine.\n\nIn anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now call ashure. \n\nTurkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives.\n\nThe Day of Ashure is an important day in the Muslim year, corresponding to the Mosaic Yom Kippur observed by Jews, and is observed by Muslims world over in honor of the prophet Moses. The Tenth of Muharrem Day of Ashura also marks the end of the Battle of Karbala and is a special day of observance in Shia Islam. Among Turkish and Balkan Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment.\n\nAshure represents many cultures' beliefs, Islamic and pre-Islamic alike, and therefore is celebrated to commemorate many spiritual events believed to have happened on this day; for example, it is believed that:\n\n\nThe Armenian version is called \"anuşabur\". Armenians serve it during Christmas and on New Year's Eve. Like \"ashure\" it may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates.\n\nTurkish author Elif Şafak has scenes involving \"ashure\" in \"The Flea Palace\" and \"The Bastard of Istanbul\". In \"The Flea Palace\" Şafak writes, \"As they boiled there on the stove, all the ingredients prattled on in unison but each in its own language,\" and in \"The Bastard of Istanbul\" Mustafa recalls childhood memories of eating the bowls of dessert he had been entrusted to distribute to his neighbors.\n\n"}

{"id": "9179644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9179644", "title": "Multi-threshold CMOS", "text": "Multi-threshold CMOS\n\nMulti-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) is a variation of CMOS chip technology which has transistors with multiple threshold voltages (V) in order to optimize delay or power. The V of a MOSFET is the gate voltage where an inversion layer forms at the interface between the insulating layer (oxide) and the substrate (body) of the transistor. Low V devices switch faster, and are therefore useful on critical delay paths to minimize clock periods. The penalty is that low V devices have substantially higher static leakage power. High V devices are used on non-critical paths to reduce static leakage power without incurring a delay penalty. Typical high V devices reduce static leakage by 10 times compared with low V devices. \n\nOne method of creating devices with multiple threshold voltages is to apply different bias voltages (Vb) to the base or bulk terminal of the transistors. Other methods involve adjusting the gate oxide thickness, gate oxide dielectric constant (material type), or dopant concentration in the channel region beneath the gate oxide. \n\nA common method of fabricating multi-threshold CMOS involves simply adding additional photolithography and ion implantation steps. For a given fabrication process, the V is adjusted by altering the concentration of dopant atoms in the channel region beneath the gate oxide. Typically, the concentration is adjusted by ion implantation method. For example, photolithography methods are applied to cover all devices except the p-MOSFETs with photoresist. Ion implantation is then completed, with ions of the chosen dopant type penetrating the gate oxide in areas where no photoresist is present. The photoresist is then stripped. Photolithography methods are again applied to cover all devices except the n-MOSFETs. Another implantation is then completed using a different dopant type, with ions penetrating the gate oxide. The photoresist is stripped. At some point during the subsequent fabrication process, implanted ions are activated by annealing at an elevated temperature.\n\nIn principle, any number of threshold voltage transistors can be produced. For CMOS having two threshold voltages, one additional photomasking and implantation step is required for each of p-MOSFET and n-MOSFET. For fabrication of normal, low, and high V CMOS, four additional steps are required relative to conventional single-V CMOS.\n\nThe most common implementation of MTCMOS for reducing power makes use of sleep transistors. Logic is supplied by a virtual power rail. Low V devices are used in the logic where fast switching speed is important. High V devices connecting the power rails and virtual power rails are turned on in active mode, off in sleep mode. High V devices are used as sleep transistors to reduce static leakage power.\n\nThe design of the power switch which turns on and off the power supply to the logic gates is essential to low-voltage, high-speed circuit techniques such as MTCMOS. The speed, area, and power of a logic circuit are influenced by the characteristics of the power switch. \n\nIn a \"coarse-grained\" approach, high V sleep transistors gate the power to entire logic blocks. The sleep signal is de-asserted during active mode, causing the transistor to turn on and provide virtual power (ground) to the low V logic. The sleep signal is asserted during sleep mode, causing the transistor to turn off and disconnect power (ground) from the low V logic. The drawbacks of this approach are that:\n\n\nIn a \"fine-grained\" approach, high V sleep transistors are incorporated within every gate. Low V transistors are used for the pull-up and pull-down networks, and a high V transistor is used to gate the leakage current between the two networks. This approach eliminates problems of logic block partitioning and sleep transistor sizing. However, a large amount of area overhead is added due both to inclusion of additional transistors in every Boolean gate, and in creating a sleep signal distribution tree. \n\nAn intermediate approach is to incorporate high V sleep transistors into threshold gates having more complicated function. Since fewer such threshold gates are required to implement any arbitrary function compared to Boolean gates, incorporating MTCMOS into each gate requires less area overhead. Examples of threshold gates having more complicated function are found with Null Convention Logic and Sleep Convention Logic. Some art is required to implement MTCMOS without causing glitches or other problems.\n"}

They are generally found in higher rainfall flat plateau areas, and have river-like branching forms which in themselves are not very large, but combined add up to a large area. Dambos have been estimated to comprise 12.5% of the area of Zambia. Similar African words include \"mbuga\" (commonly used in East Africa), \"matoro\" (Mashonaland), \"vlei\" (South Africa), \"fadama\" (Nigeria), and \"bolis\" (Sierra Leone); the French \"bas-fond\" and German \"Spültal\" have also been suggested as referring to similar grassy wetlands.\n\nDambos are characterised by grasses, rushes and sedges, contrasting with surrounding woodland such as Miombo woodland. They may be substantially dry at the end of the dry season, revealing grey soils or black clays, but unlike a flooded grassland, they retain wet lines of drainage through the dry season. They are inundated (waterlogged) in the wet season but not generally above the height of the vegetation and any open water surface is usually confined to streams, rivers and small ponds or lagoons at the lowest point, generally near the centre.\n\nThe name dambo is most frequently used for wetlands on flat plateau which form the headwaters of streams and rivers. The definition for scientific purposes has been proposed as “seasonally waterlogged, predominantly grass covered, depressions bordering headwater drainage lines”.\n\nThe problem with the preceding definition is that the word may also be used for wetlands bordering rivers far from the headwaters, for example the dambo of the Mbereshi River where it enters the swamps of the Luapula River in Zambia, . \n\nA 1998 report of the FAO distinguished between ‘hydromorphic/phreatic’ dambos (associated with headwaters) and ‘fluvial’ dambos (associated with rivers), and also referred to five geomorphological types in Zambia’s Luapula Province: \"upland\", \"valley\", \"hanging\", \"sand dune\" and \"pan\" dambos.\n\nDambos are fed by rainfall which drains out slowly to feed streams and rivers, and are therefore a vital part of the water cycle. As well as being complex ecosystems in themselves they also play a role in the biodiversity of the region.\n\nThere is a popular idea that dambos act like sponges to soak up the wet season rain which they release slowly into rivers during the dry season thus ensuring a year-round flow, but this is opposed by some research which suggests that in the middle to late dry season the water is actually released from aquifers. Springs are seen in some dambos.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that it may take a long time, perhaps several years, for water from a heavy rainy season to percolate through hills and emerge in a dambo, creating lagoons there or a flow in downstream rivers which can't be explained by the previous year's rainfall. Dambos may be involved, for instance, in explaining puzzling variations in water level or flow in Lake Mweru Wantipa and Lake Chila in Mbala. \n\nTraditionally, dambos have been exploited:\n\nMore recently, they have been used for fish ponds and growing upland rice. Efforts to develop dambos agriculturally have been hampered by a lack of research on the hydrology and soils of dambos, which have proved to be variable and complex. \n\nA good example of a dambo can be seen at (30 km south of Mansa, Zambia) in a forest reserve. Unlike in the neighbouring areas which have been cleared for farming and charcoal-burning, the dambo contrasts well with the undisturbed Miombo woodland canopy. Note also that headwater dambos have a branching structure like rivers. Most of the dambos have roughly the same width and form the same sort of pattern.\n"}

These were cooked until the flavours had blended, when a top layer of egg and milk was added. When the latter had set, the dish was ready to be served. C. Louis Leipoldt, a South African writer and gourmet, wrote that the recipe was known in Europe in the seventeenth century.\n\nThe origin of the word Bobotie is contentious. The Afrikaans etymological dictionary claims that the probable origin is the Malayan word boemboe, meaning curry spices. Others think it to have originated from \"bobotok\", an Indonesian dish which consisted of totally different ingredients. The first recipe for bobotie appeared in a Dutch cookbook in 1609. Afterwards, it was taken to South Africa and adopted by the Cape Malay community. It is also made with curry powder leaving it with a slight \"tang\". It is often served with sambal. The dish has been known in the Cape of Good Hope since the 17th century, when it was made with a mixture of mutton and pork.\n\nToday, bobotie is much more likely to be made with beef or lamb, although pork lends the dish extra moisture. Early recipes incorporated ginger, marjoram and lemon rind; the introduction of curry powder has simplified the recipe but the basic concept remains the same. Some recipes also call for chopped onions and almonds to be added to the mixture. Traditionally, bobotie incorporates dried fruit like raisins or sultanas. It is often garnished with walnuts, chutney and bananas. Although not particularly spicy, the dish incorporates a variety of flavours that can add complexity. For example, the dried fruit (usually apricots and raisins/sultanas) contrasts the curry flavouring. The texture of the dish is also complex, the baked egg mixture topping complementing the milk-soaked bread which adds moisture to the dish. Bobotie is usually served with \"yellow rice\", which is rice cooked with turmeric.\n\nLeipoldt's recipe book published in 1933 calls for finely minced meat, breadcrumbs, milk, onions and butter and a curry sauce made with spices, sugar, lemon juice, chilli pepper and vinegar. This is baked with a topping of egg and milk.\n\nA 1923 recipe by Mrs S. van H. Tulleken uses mutton, almonds, bitter almond essence, onions, butter, bread, curry powder, lemon juice, eggs and sugar, baked with a custard topping of eggs and milk.\n\nBobotie recipes were transported by South African settlers to other parts of Africa. Today, recipes for it can be found that originated in white settler communities in Kenya, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. There is a variation that was popular among the 7,000 Boer settlers who settled in the Chubut River Valley in Argentina in the early 20th century, in which the bobotie mixture is packed inside a large pumpkin, which is then baked until tender.\n\nBobotie was selected by 2008 Masters golf champion and South African native Trevor Immelman as the featured menu item for Augusta National's annual \"Champions Dinner\" in April 2009. Each year, the reigning champion at The Masters golf tournament, played every year in Augusta, Georgia, hosts the gathering and tends to create a menu featuring delicacies from his home region.\n\nSouth African Bobotie is one of the featured items on the menu; it is also served with turkey and mushrooms. It is listed as gluten free. It is also on the every day menu at the buffet restaurant Boma at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge.\n\n\n"}

SAR responders on horseback are primarily a search resource, but also can provide off-road logistics support and transportation. Mounted SAR responders can in some terrains move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport more equipment, and may be physically less exhausted than a SAR responder performing the same task on foot. Mounted SAR responders typically have longer initial response times than \"groundpounder\" SAR resources, due to the time required to pick up trailer, horse(s), and perhaps also water, feed, and equipment.\n\nPrincipally volunteer units exist in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Iceland.\n\nIn the United States, many counties have specially deputized, usually volunteer, mounted search and rescue groups. Some of these groups date from World War II. Across the United States, SAR groups are in the process of organizing themselves into associations, usually within states. Formal guidelines for MSAR have been established in several states: California, New Mexico, Maine, Maryland, and Virginia. International standards for the mounted searcher have been developed through the ASTM F32 committee for Search and Rescue.\n\nIn Germany, the voluntary humanitarian association Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe (JUH) recently has begun establishing local and regional groups that provide first responder services on horseback. These are modeled after the road-based first aid service of the JUH, except that the horse provides for off-road travel. The first group, established in March 2001 in Harburg, adopted standards of the Deutsche Reiterliche Vereinigung (FN) for first responders at equestrian field sporting events. In 2008, there were 8 groups. Around the same time the German Red Cross briefly recognized a group with a similar function.\n\nA search and rescue horse is a horse trained and used to perform mounted search and rescue. In many cases, the horse is simply a means of transportation for a SAR responder. In other cases, the horse is a full member of the SAR field team. Like a SAR dog, a SAR horse can be trained to search for lost persons, using its keen senses of hearing, scenting, and vision. In addition, some mounted SAR responders work a SAR dog from horseback.\n\nThe primary role of Mounted SAR is in the \"search\" capacity. Riders and horses are normally trained to safely and effectively perform the search function. Riders have training as searchers that includes the detection and protection of clues that may lead to locating the missing person. The mounts used are expected to be calm and reliable.\n\nA common training for searchers mounted on equine is \"Look where the horse looks.\" While there is training available to have the horse or mule perform similarly to a SAR Dog, the majority of Mounted SAR equine and their riders do not have this training. However, the equine's natural senses and behavior are valuable during a search, without particular training, making that animal a viable search partner for clue detection. \nThe horse or mule exhibits behavior to indicate noting \"something\" as part of that animal's natural behavior, and the rider determines if the equine may have noted the presence of a person who may be the missing person, or a clue that might help lead to that person.\n\nSome Mounted SAR riders have additional training specific to searching for clues from the saddle. This valuable skill allows the mounted searcher to move more quickly riding when the clues, such as shoe prints, are visible from the saddle. Riders dismount as needed when a closer view or tracking while walking is more advantageous.\n\nIn a rescue situation today, horses have two main uses: rapid response and subject transport. Both uses occur primarily in areas inaccessible to road-based emergency vehicles: in coastal areas where heavier vehicles tend to become stuck in wet ground or deep sand, and in wilderness areas. In these areas, horses may be used to patrol and in some cases transport people needing assistance. Examples include a volunteer horse patrol at Hampton Beach, New Hampshire.\n\nAs an example of a typical MSAR rapid response, a deployment in northern Germany proceeded as follows.\n\nIn areas where ground-based transport is especially difficult or slow (both urban areas and wilderness), people in need of urgent medical care often are transported by helicopter. In these areas, MSAR teams train in working with helicopters. Training involves identification of suitable landing spots, accustoming horses to helicopters operating in close proximity, and helicopter safety.\n\nTransport in the saddle is used, but has more limited application than a hand carried or animal mounted litter. In the United States transport in the saddle is a method taught and used within the National Park Service in Yosemite National Park and some Mounted SAR personnel have this training.\n\nMules for medical evacuation is also specialized training for combat soldiers in the Animal Packing Course at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center. \"Mountain Medicine instructors have developed special saddles for transporting patients who can sit up and stretchers for patients lying down,\" and these \"saddles\" are created from materials readily available even in third world countries, according to Olive-Drab. Mounted SAR training uses a traditional saddle. A western saddle is shown in the photo.\n\nEquine used as pack animals may also carry medical supplies to support a rescue. Some Mounted SAR units also have pack animals used as resources, but this is more common in more vast wilderness or mountain regions where it is more common to find riders experienced in the use of pack animals. In America, often those members are drawn from professional packers or members of a local unit of Backcountry Horsemen.\n\nHistorically, there were few alternatives to horses for subject transport. Several books and reports have been published, describing transport of sick or injured persons using horses. The equipment described in these publications included a wide variety of special-purpose carts, wagons, and litters. Litters were used to carry passengers between two horses, or on the back of a pack horse or mule (or camel; see Light horse field ambulance).\n\n(*) Note: The “litter” in the picture is not really a litter, designed to protect the patient and to be moved by horses, but a carriage used in hippotherapy;\nthe patient, often multiple disabled, is positioned on a cloth over the back of the horses. The patient will feel all movements and warmth of the horses, which improves (amongst others) blood circulation and health in general.\n\nIn India a pack litter was known as a \"dhooley\". In Europe, and sometimes in the United States, it was known as a \"cacolet\". The pack litter had two major variants: one carried a single person above the pack animal's back; the other carried two persons, one on each side. In the United States Civil War, horses were fitted with litters to transport wounded soldiers from the battlefield. Similar litters, and training manuals for using them, were produced for the United States Army circa World War I. These litters included the 2-person \"Carlisle cacolet\" and the 1-person \"1st Division cacolet\".\n\nThe travois is very stable and difficult to capsize. Apparently not used in Europe, it was widely used in North America by Native Americans from before the Colonial period. After the 1877 Battle of the Clearwater in Idaho, George Miller Sternberg used travois to move wounded soldiers from the battlefield to a hospital 25 miles away. In very rough field conditions, travois are sometimes used even today.\n\n\n"}

Kuttāb means \"writers\", plural \" / \".\n\nIn common Modern Arabic usage, \"maktab\" means \"office\" while \"maktabah\" means \"library\" or \"(place of) study\" and \"kuttāb\" is a plural word meaning \"books\".\n\nIn the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a \"maktab\", which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to higher education), a \"maktab\" was often attached to a mosque. In the 16th century, the Sunni Islamic jurist Ibn Hajar al-Haytami discussed \"Maktab\" schools. In response to a petition from a retired Shia Islamic judge who ran a \"Madhab\" elementary school for orphans, al-Haytami issues a fatwa outlining a structure of \"maktab\" education that prevented any physical or economic exploitation of enrolled orphans.\n\nIn the 11th century, the famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher, Ibn Sina (known as \"Avicenna\" in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the \"maktab\" entitled \"The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children\", as a guide to teachers working at \"maktab\" schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sina described the curriculum of a \"maktab\" school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a \"maktab\" school.\n\nIbn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a \"maktab\" school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics, language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).\n\nIbn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of \"maktab\" schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.\n\nIn medieval times, the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity. The emergence of the Maktab and Madrasah institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval Islamic world.\n\n\n"}

A soundcheck is usually done when a venue is empty, so that the audience does not have to hear the process. \nSoundchecks are usually conducted prior to audience entry to the venue. The sound check may start with the rhythm section, and then go on to the melody section and vocalists. After technical adjustments have been completed by the sound crew, the performers leave the stage and the audience is admitted. Since the acoustics of a venue often change somewhat once it is filled with audience members, the sound engineer often has to make minor modifications to the sound system settings and levels once the audience is there. \n\nIf there is more than one artist performing, soundchecks can be more complicated.\n\nSome acts will do multi-track audio recordings of one or more soundchecks. Those recordings will be used as the sound sources for future soundchecks, to reduce or possibly eliminate the need for the performers to be present.

The name \"magnesium citrate\" is ambiguous and sometimes may refer to other salts such as trimagnesium citrate which has a magnesium:citrate ratio of 3:2.\n\nMagnesium citrate is used medicinally as a saline laxative and to completely empty the bowel prior to a major surgery or colonoscopy. It is available without a prescription, both as a generic and under various brand names. It is also used in the pill form as a magnesium dietary supplement. It contains 11.23% magnesium by weight. Compared to trimagnesium citrate, it is much more water-soluble, less alkaline, and contains less magnesium.\n\nAs a food additive, magnesium citrate is used to regulate acidity and is known as E number E345.\n\nMagnesium citrate works by attracting water through the tissues by a process known as osmosis. Once in the intestine, it can attract enough water into the intestine to induce defecation. The additional water stimulates bowel motility. This means it can also be used to treat rectal and colon problems. Magnesium citrate functions best on an empty stomach, and should always be followed with a full (eight ounce or 25 cl) glass of water or juice to help the magnesium citrate absorb properly and help prevent any complications. Magnesium citrate solutions generally produce bowel movement in one half to three hours.\n\nThe maximum upper tolerance limit (UTL) for magnesium in supplement form for adults is 350 mg of elemental magnesium per day, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In addition, according to the NIH, total dietary requirements for magnesium from all sources (i.e., food and supplements) is 320–420 mg of elemental magnesium per day, though there is no UT for dietary magnesium.\n\nAs a laxative syrup with a concentration of 1.745 g of magnesium citrate per fluid ounce, a typical dose for adults and children twelve years or older is between , followed immediately with a full glass of water. Consuming an adult dose of 10 oz of laxative syrup (@ 1.745 g/oz) implies a consumption of 17.45 g of magnesium citrate in a single 10 oz dose resulting in a consumption of approximately 2.0 g of elemental magnesium per single dose. This laxative dose contains five times the recommended nutritional dose for children. Magnesium citrate is not recommended for use in children and infants two years of age or less.\n\nAlthough less common, as a magnesium supplement the citrate form is sometimes used because it is believed to be more bioavailable than other common pill forms, such as magnesium oxide. However, according to one study, magnesium gluconate is marginally more bioavailable than magnesium citrate.\n\nMagnesium citrate, as a supplement in pill form, is useful for the prevention of kidney stones.\n\nMagnesium citrate is generally not a harmful substance, but care should be taken by consulting a healthcare professional if any adverse health problems are suspected or experienced. Extreme magnesium overdose can result in serious complications such as slow heart beat, low blood pressure, nausea, drowsiness, etc. If severe enough, an overdose can even result in coma or death. However, a moderate overdose will be excreted through the kidneys, unless one has serious kidney problems. Rectal bleeding or failure to have a bowel movement after use could be signs of a serious condition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9346573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9346573", "title": "Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification", "text": "Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification\n\nMultiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a variation of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction that permits amplification of multiple targets with only a single primer pair.\n\nEach probe consists of two oligonucleotides which recognize adjacent target sites on the DNA. One probe oligonucleotide contains the sequence recognized by the forward primer, the other contains the sequence recognized by the reverse primer. Only when both probe oligonucleotides are hybridized to their respective targets, can they be ligated into a complete probe. The advantage of splitting the probe into two parts is that only the ligated oligonucleotides, but not the unbound probe oligonucleotides, are amplified. If the probes were not split in this way, the primer sequences at either end would cause the probes to be amplified regardless of their hybridization to the template DNA, and the amplification product would not be dependent on the number of target sites present in the sample DNA. Each complete probe has a unique length, so that its resulting amplicons can be separated and identified by (capillary) electrophoresis. This avoids the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR. Because the forward primer used for probe amplification is fluorescently labeled, each amplicon generates a fluorescent peak which can be detected by a capillary sequencer. Comparing the peak pattern obtained on a given sample with that obtained on various reference samples, the relative quantity of each amplicon can be determined. This ratio is a measure for the ratio in which the target sequence is present in the sample DNA.\n\nVarious techniques including DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis), DHPLC (Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography), and SSCA (Single Strand Conformation Analysis) effectively identify SNPs and small insertions and deletions. MLPA, however, is one of the only accurate, time-efficient techniques to detect genomic deletions and insertions (one or more entire exons), which are frequent causes of cancers such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), breast, and ovarian cancer. MLPA can successfully and easily determine the relative copy number of all exons within a gene simultaneously with high sensitivity.\n\nAn important use of MLPA is to determine relative ploidy. For example, probes may be designed to target various regions of chromosome 21 of a human cell. The signal strengths of the probes are compared with those obtained from a reference DNA sample known to have two copies of the chromosome. If an extra copy is present in the test sample, the signals are expected to be 1.5 times the intensities of the respective probes from the reference. If only one copy is present the proportion is expected to be 0.5. If the sample has two copies, the relative probe strengths are expected to be equal.\n\nDosage quotient analysis is the usual method of interpreting MLPA data. If a and b are the signals from two amplicons in the patient sample, and A and B are the corresponding amplicons in the experimental control, then the dosage quotient DQ = (a/b) / (A/B). Although dosage quotients may be calculated for any pair of amplicons, it is usually the case that one of the pair is an internal reference probe.\n\nMLPA facilitates the amplification and detection of multiple targets with a single primer pair. In a standard multiplex PCR reaction, each fragment needs a unique amplifying primer pair. These primers being present in a large quantity result in various problems such as dimerization and false priming. With MLPA, amplification of probes can be achieved. Thus, many sequences (up to 40) can be amplified and quantified using just a single primer pair. MLPA reaction is fast, inexpensive and very simple to perform.\n\nMLPA has a variety of applications including detection of mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms, analysis of DNA methylation, relative mRNA quantification, chromosomal characterisation of cell lines and tissue samples, detection of gene copy number, detection of duplications and deletions in human cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, hMLH1 and hMSH2 and aneuploidy determination. MLPA has potential application in prenatal diagnosis both invasive and noninvasive.\n\n"}

The Dardi School constituted both the last great medieval Western martial arts tradition as well as the first great Renaissance tradition, embracing both armed and unarmed combat. No manuscript ascribed to Dardi himself survives, although his tradition became the foundation for the work of Antonio Manciolino and Achille Marozzo, both possibly students of famed Bolognese master Guido Antonio de Luca.\n\nThe Bolognese masters whose treatises have survived shared a greater consistency of style, terminology and pedagogy with each other than with fencing masters of the period from other parts of Italy, thus justifying their treatment as a single school. The Dardi school focused primarily the single-handed side-sword still used for both cutting and thrusting. The side-sword was used in combination with various defensive weapons, including a shield (\"brocchiero\", \"rotella\" or \"targa\"), a dagger, a gauntlet or a cape. The two-handed sword or \"spadone\" was also still taught, although losing its prominence. In addition, instruction on fighting with the poleaxe and other polearms was given.\n\nThe \"Opera Nova\" of Antonio Manciolino was apparently first published in the early 1520s, but only a copy of the likely second edition, \"newly revised and printed\" in 1531, has survived. It was dedicated to Don Luis de Cordoba, the imperial ambassador to Pope Adrian VI from late 1522 to late 1523.\n\nAchille Marozzo's text \"Opera Nova dell'arte delle armi\" (\"New Treatise on the Art of Arms\") was published in 1536 in Modena, dedicated to Count Rangoni. Considered the most important work on Italian fencing of the 16th century, it exemplifies techniques about fighting in a judicial duel with all the major weapons of the times and includes a large section on the conventions and rules of the duel.\n\nThe \"L'Arte della Spada\" (\"Art of the Sword\") treatise by the \"Anonimo Bolognese\" (anonymous master of Bologna), Manuscripts Ravenna M-345 and M-346, is an early 16th-century fencing manual of the Bolognese school. It is dated to the \"very first years of the 1500s\" by Rubboli and Cesari (2005), who would like to ascribe it to the master of Manciolino, while other estimates place it closer to 1550.\n\nAngelo Viggiani's \"Lo Schermo\" was written around 1550 and published posthumously, ca. 1575.\n\nGiovanni dall'Agocchie, \"Dell'Arte di Scrimia\", 1572.

Its defining features are an acidic juice (such as lemon or lime) and carbonated water.\n\nThe first printed reference to \"fiz\" is in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas's \"Bartender's Guide\", which contains six such recipes. The fizz became widely popular in America between 1900 and the 1940s. Known as a hometown specialty of New Orleans, the gin fizz was so popular that bars would employ teams of bartenders that would take turns shaking the drinks. Demand for fizzes went international at least as early as 1950, as evidenced by its inclusion in the French cookbook \"L'Art Culinaire Francais\" published that year.\n\nA gin fizz is the best-known cocktail in the fizz family. A gin fizz contains gin, lemon juice, and sugar, which are shaken with ice, poured into a tumbler and topped with carbonated water. The drink is similar to a Tom Collins, with a possible distinction being a Tom Collins historically used \"Old Tom Gin\" (a slightly sweeter precursor to London Dry Gin), whereas the kind of gin historically used in a gin fizz is unknown.\n\nSimple variations on the gin fizz are \n\nA Ramos gin fizz (also known as a \"Ramos fizz\" or \"New Orleans fizz\") contains gin, lemon juice, lime juice, egg white, sugar, cream, orange flower water, and soda water. It is served in a large non-tapered 12 to 14 ounce Collins glass.\n\nThe orange flower water and egg significantly affect the flavor and texture of a Ramos, compared to a regular gin fizz. The key to making this egg cocktail is dissolving the sugar before adding ice; the sugar acts as an emulsifier, and it and the alcohol \"cook\" the egg white.\n\nHenry C. Ramos invented the Ramos gin fizz in 1888 at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was originally called a \"New Orleans fizz\", and is one of the city's most famous cocktails. Before Prohibition, the drink's popularity and exceptionally long 12-minute mixing time had over 20 bartenders working at the Imperial at once making nothing but the Ramos gin fizz - and still struggling to keep up with demand. During the carnival of 1915, 32 staff members were on at once, just to shake the drink.\n\nThe Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans also popularized the drink, abetted by Governor Huey Long's fondness for it. In July 1935, Long brought a bartender named Sam Guarino from the Roosevelt Hotel to the New Yorker Hotel in New York City to teach its staff how to make the drink so he could have it whenever he was there. The Museum of the American Cocktail has newsreel footage of this event. The Roosevelt Hotel group trademarked the drink name in 1935 and still makes it today. \n\nA traditional sloe gin fizz contains sloe gin (a blackthorn plum flavored spirit), grapefruit juice, simple syrup, egg white, and carbonated water. \nA popular alternative eliminates the egg white. \nThe original recipe is made with grapefruit juice, because of the mixing of recipes you will find many recipes with lemon juice.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

Craddock describes his recipe as \"\"...a variation of the Grapefruit Cocktail...\"\", suggesting that such cocktails were already in common use before his book was written. His recipe consists of nothing but gin, grapefruit juice and ice.\n\nA recipe for a similar cocktail with the name \"Greyhound\" appears in Harper's magazine in 1945 (volume 191, page 461) thus: \"\"The cocktails were made of vodka, sugar, and canned grapefruit juice -- a greyhound. This cocktail was served at Greyhound's popular restaurant chain that was located at bus terminals, called 'Post House'.\"\"\n\nBefore 1945, vodka was an uncommon spirit and most drinks we think of today as \"classic cocktails\" and which call for vodka, originally would have contained gin. As vodka's popularity grew after the War and gin's popularity waned, many of the popular cocktails persisted, albeit with vodka substituted for gin. The most conspicuous of these is the Martini which, before 1945, would invariably have been made with gin.\n\nThe reason that most cocktails during and just after prohibition were prepared with salted or sugared rims is because the quality of adult beverages was not so appealing. Also, more currently, both the greyhounds and the salty dogs are more often ordered / made with vodkas not gins. The root cause of this is for taste preferences and to serve a broader market.\n\nFor the greyhound, twist of lime or lemon.\n\nVodka Greyhound: uses vodka instead of gin.\n\nSalty dog: has a salted rim on the glass and uses vodka sometimes.\n\nDalmatian: has black pepper syrup and vodka.\n\nItalian Greyhound: uses Campari and vodka instead of gin.\n"}

Over the years, the sweet has found home in many Kumaoni stories and folklore, arising from the milieu of Kumaon, as evident from the memoirs of noted Hindi writer.\n\nBal Mithai is made by cooking khoya (evaporated milk cream) with cane sugar, until it becomes dark brown in color, colloquially called \"chocolate\" for its color resemblance.

In January 2015, Slovenia successfully entered it into the register of protected geographical indications (PGIs), despite objections by Austria, Croatia and Germany.\n\nThe noun \"klobasa\" refers to a small sausage generally served whole (in contrast to \"salama\") in Slovene. The adjective \"kranjska\" derives from the region of Carniola (\"Kranjska\" in Slovene, \"Krain\" in German), which used to be a duchy of the Austrian Empire. The earliest mention of the Carniolan sausage in German is found in Katharina Prato's renowned cookbook \"Süddeutsche Küche\" (South German Cooking, 1896, first edition 1858). The Slovene term \"kranjska klobasa\" was first mentioned in the sixth edition of \"Slovenska kuharica\" (Slovene Cookbook) by Felicita Kalinšek in 1912.\n\nThe Carniolan sausage contains at least 75 to 80% pork (aside from bacon), and at most 20% bacon. It may contain as much as 5% water, the sea salt from Sečovlje salt pans, little garlic, saltpetre and black pepper. No other ingredients are permitted. The meat must be cut in small pieces 10 to 13 mm and bacon 8 to 10 mm. The filling is stuffed into pork intestine with a diameter of 32 to 36 mm. They are formed in pairs of lengths and a weight of 180 to 220 grams. Pairs are linked together with a wooden skewer. The sausages are hot smoked and heat-cured at about .\n\nThe \"Käsekrainer\" is a variation of this sausage made with small chunks of cheese. \"Käsekrainer\" contains 10% to 20% cheese (e.g., Emmentaler) cut in small cubes. \"Käsekrainer\" were first made in Austria in the early 1980s. Today they are a standard offering at sausage stands (Würstelstand). \"Käsekrainer\" can be boiled, baked or grilled. It is essential to keep them on low to medium heat; otherwise the outside is burned and the inside is still cold. Care should be taken when preparing them, because the cheese can become quite hot; the sausages should not be cut or poked while cooking, otherwise the melting cheese would be released.\n\nThe sausage can be served with curry on top; mustard, ketchup, and a piece of dark bread or in the most common form in Austria as a \"Käsekrainer-Hot-Dog\". (By \"Hot Dog\" Austrians mean the bun not the sausage.) The bread used is very similar to a French baguette, but shorter ( long). The bun is cut open at one end and a hole is poked into it with a warm metal rod. The next step is to put sauce in the hole. Austrians usually select from the following three: sharp mustard, sweet mustard, and ketchup. Often the choice is ketchup and one – or even both – of the mustards.\n\nKranjska klobasa is known as Kransky in Australia, where it was introduced by post-war immigrants from Croatia and Slovenia in the late 1940s and the 1950s. Cheese Kransky is very popular in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n"}

This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush, but rather fill out the line. Patio sodas were available in the cold-bottle market: grocery and mom-and-pop stores. Advertising for Patio was comparatively scarce; at the time, bottlers were regionally franchised, and related advertising was necessarily local.\n\nIn 1964, Patio Diet Cola became Diet Pepsi. The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi, with the tagline \"Pepsi either way\", which replaced the slogan \"Dances with flavor\".

{"id": "9487577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9487577", "title": "Surgical staple", "text": "Surgical staple\n\nSurgical staples are specialized staples used in surgery in place of sutures to close skin wounds, connect or remove parts of the bowels or lungs. The use of staples over sutures reduces the local inflammatory response, width of the wound, and the time it takes to close.\n\nA more recent development, from the 1990s, uses clips instead of staples for some applications; this does not require the staple to penetrate.\n\nThe technique was pioneered by \"father of surgical stapling\", Hungarian surgeon Hümér Hültl. Hultl's prototype stapler of 1908 weighed , and required two hours to assemble and load.\n\nThe technology was refined in the 1950s in the Soviet Union, allowing for the first commercially produced re-usable stapling devices for creation of bowel and vascular anastomoses. Mark M. Ravitch brought a sample of stapling device after attending a surgical conference in USSR, and introduced it to entrepreneur Leon C. Hirsch, who founded the United States Surgical Corporation in 1964 to manufacture surgical staplers under its Auto Suture brand. Until the late 1970s USSC had the market essentially to itself, but in 1977 Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon brand entered the market and today both are widely used, along with competitors from the Far East. USSC was bought by Tyco Healthcare in 1998, which became Covidien on June 29, 2007.\n\nSafety and patency of mechanical (stapled) bowel anastomoses has been widely studied. It is generally the case in such studies that sutured anastomoses are either comparable or less prone to leakage. It is possible that this is the result of recent advances in suture technology, along with increasingly risk-conscious surgical practice. Certainly modern synthetic sutures are more predictable and less prone to infection than catgut, silk and linen, which were the main suture materials used up to the 1990s.\n\nOne key feature of intestinal staplers is that the edges of the stapler act as a haemostat, compressing the edges of the wound and closing blood vessels during the stapling process. Recent studies have shown that with current suturing techniques there is no significant difference in outcome between hand sutured and mechanical anastomoses (including clips), but mechanical anastomoses are significantly quicker to perform.\n\nIn patients that are subjected to pulmonary resections where lung tissue is sealed with staplers, there is often postoperative air leaks. Alternative techniques to seal lung tissue are currently investigated.\n\nThe first commercial staplers were made of stainless steel with titanium staples loaded into reloadable staple cartridges.\n\nModern surgical staplers are either disposable and made of plastic, or reusable and made of stainless steel. Both types are generally loaded using disposable cartridges.\n\nThe staple line may be straight, curved or circular. Circular staplers are used for end-to-end anastomosis after bowel resection or, somewhat more controversially, in esophagogastric surgery. The instruments may be used in either open or laparoscopic surgery, different instruments are used for each application. Laparoscopic staplers are longer, thinner, and may be articulated to allow for access from a restricted number of trocar ports.\n\nSome staplers incorporate a knife, to complete excision and anastomosis in a single operation. \nStaplers are used to close both internal and skin wounds. Skin staples are usually applied using a disposable stapler, and removed with a specialized staple remover. Staplers are also used in vertical banded gastroplasty surgery (popularly known as \"stomach stapling\").\nWhile devices for circular end-to-end anastomosis of digestive tract are widely used, in spite of intensive research circular staplers for vascular anastomosis never had yet significant impact on standard hand (Carrel) suture technique. Apart from the different modality of coupling of vascular (everted) in respect to digestive (inverted) stumps, the main basic reason could be that, particularly for small vessels, the manuality and precision required just for positioning on vascular stumps and actioning any device cannot be significantly inferior to that required to carry out the standard hand suture, then making of little utility the use of any device. An exception to that however could be organ transplantation where these two phases, i.e.device positioning at the vascular stumps and device actioning, can be carried out in different time, by different surgical team, in safe conditions when the time required does not influence donor organ preservation, i.e. at the back table in cold ischemia condition for the donor organ and after native organ removal in the recipient. This is finalized to make as brief as possible the donor organ dangerous warm ischemia phase that can be contained in the couple of minutes or less necessary just to connect the device's ends and actioning the stapler.\n\nAlthough most surgical staples are made of titanium, stainless steel is more often used in some skin staples and clips. Titanium produces less reaction with the immune system and, being non-ferrous, does not interfere significantly with MRI scanners, although some imaging artifacts may result. Synthetic absorbable (bioabsorbable) staples are also now becoming available, based on polyglycolic acid, as with many synthetic absorbable sutures.\n\nTitanium staples are not suspected of causing nickel reactions because nickel is rarely if ever used in titanium alloys.\n\nWhere skin staples are used to seal a skin wound it will be necessary to remove the staples after an appropriate healing period, usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the location of the wound and other factors. The skin staple remover is a small manual device which consists of a shoe or plate that is sufficiently narrow and thin to insert under the skin staple. The active part is a small blade that, when hand-pressure is exerted, pushes the staple down through a slot in the shoe, deforming the staple into an 'M' shape to facilitate its removal. In an emergency it is possible to remove staples with a pair of artery forceps.\nSkin staple removers are manufactured in many shapes and forms, some disposable and some reusable.\n\n"}

It means \"soup to chase a hangover\" and is also called \"sulguk\" (). It usually consists of dried Napa cabbage, vegetables and meat in a hearty beef broth. One type of haejangguk, Seonjiguk, includes sliced congealed ox blood (similar to black pudding) and another type, Sundaeguk includes a kind of blood sausage made with intestine stuffed with pig's blood and other ingredients.\n\nIn the \"Nogeoldae\", a manual for learning spoken Chinese published in the late Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), the term \"seongjutang\" () appears. It means \"soup to get sober\" and is assumed to be the origin of \"haejangguk\". According to the record, the soup consists of thinly sliced meat, noodles, scallions, and powder of \"\"cheoncho\"\" () in a broth. The composition is same as the basic recipe of a present-day \"haejangguk\".\n\nAlthough \"haejangguk\" is not mentioned in cookbooks written during the Joseon (1392–1910), relevant contents can be seen in genre paintings and documents of the late Joseon. In Shin Yun-bok (b. 1758)'s painting titled \"Jumakdo\" ( \"Painting of the Tavern\"), a scene regarding \"haejangguk\" is well depicted. A group of unemployed children of the rich gather to eat \"haejangguk\" while a \"jumo\" (a female owner of a \"jumak\") ladles boiling soup out of a cauldron.\n\nThis dish seemed to be eaten not only by commoners. According to \"Haedong jukji\" (海東竹枝), poetry collection written by Choe Yeong-nyeon (崔永年 1856∼1935), \"haejangguk\" is referred to as \"hyojonggaeng\" (), which literally means a \"dawn bell soup\". The book states that the area within Namhansanseong is known for making the soup well. The ingredients for the soup are inner parts of Napa cabbage, and \"kongnamul\" (soybean sprouts), mushrooms, galbi, sea cucumber, and abalone. They are mixed together with \"tojang\" (fermented bean paste) and are simmered thoroughly for a day. The cooked soup is then put into a \"hangari\" or earthen crock covered with a pad of cotton and sent to Seoul at night. When the dawn bell rings the time, the soup is delivered to a house of high-ranking officials. The \"hangari\" is still warm and the soup is very good for relieving hangovers. The record suggests that \"hyojonggaeng\" is either the first delivery food to cure a hangover after a banquet held by \"jaesang\" was ended or was used as a bribe.\n\nThere are various types of \"haejangguk\" according to region based on ingredients and recipe that give each variety its own characteristic taste. \"Haejangguk\" of the Seoul region is a kind of \"tojangguk\" (soybean paste soup) made with \"kongnamul\", radish, napa cabbage, scallions, coagulated ox blood, and \"tojang\" in a broth. The broth is prepared by simmering ox bones in a pot with water for hours. The neighborhood of Cheongjin-dong is famous for the Seoul style haejangguk.\n\nIn the city of Jeonju, people eat \"\"kongnamaul gukbap\"\" as a \"haejangguk\". A little lean \"kongnamul\" with the length of an index finger are poached in water diluted with a small amount of salt. Along with the \"kongnamul\", steamed rice, sliced ripe kimchi, scallions and garlic, beef broth, and a small amount of shank are put into a \"ttukbaegi\" (a small earthen pot) over heat and the \"kongnamul\" broth is poured into it. When the ingredients are boiled, a raw egg is cracked over the soup. Once it is served, a mixture of sesame seeds and salt, scallions, minced garlic, chili pepper, and chili pepper powder, and \"saeujeot\" (salted fermented shrimp) are put into the \"haejanguk\" are added according to the diner's taste. It is said that, when eating \"haejangguk\", if the diner drinks a cup of \"moju\" (母酒) made by boiling a fermented mixture of \"makgeolli\" (a type of rice wine), sugar, and wheat flour, the combination would be good to alleviate the hangover.\n\nThere are also \"haejangguk\" with cold soup. On the shore of the East Sea, especially in Uljin County, \"ojingeo mulhoe guksu\" (오징어물회국수) is eaten as a \"haejangguk\". Finely sliced squid like noodles is mixed with a sauce and cold water is poured over it along with ice cubes.\n\n\n\n"}

Hohhot Shaomai is served in the unit of \"Liang\", which means either eight steamed ones served in a steamer tier, or eight fried ones served in a dish. \"Liang\" is equal to 50 grams, being traditionally used as an indication of the total weight of the wrapping. Hohhot Shaomai is commonly served with vinegar and tea, due to its greasiness.\n\nThis is the most well-known variety in the West, which is from the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. As prepared in Cantonese cuisine, \"siumaai\" is also referred to as \"pork and mushroom dumpling.\" Its standard filling consisting primarily of ground pork, small whole or chopped shrimp, Chinese black mushroom, green onion (also called scallion) and ginger with seasonings of Chinese rice wine (e.g. Shaoxing rice wine), soy sauce, sesame oil and chicken stock. Bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and pepper can also be added. The outer covering is made of a thin sheet of lye water dough, which is either yellow or white. The center is usually garnished with an orange dot, made of crab roe or diced carrot, although a green dot made with a pea may be used. The decorative presentations vary.\n\nA fish paste variety of \"siumaai\" is sold as a popular street food in Hong Kong, usually alongside curry fishballs. It is most often eaten with a sweet soy sauce and chili oil.\n\nCalled the chrysanthemum shaomai, this variety is made in Changsha, Hunan province. This shaomai is named so, due to its opening resembling the chrysanthemum flower petal shape with the egg-yolk. It is spicy with pepper and the wrapper is translucent. Filling largely consists of glutinous rice, pork hash, shrimp, Chinese mushroom (otherwise known as shiitake) bamboo shoots and onion.\n\n\"Shaomai\" prepared in the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River, stretching from Shanghai to Nanjing). Filling is similar to \"zongzi\", containing soy sauce, Chinese rice wine e.g. Shaoxing wine, marinated pork pieces in glutinous rice and steamed with pork fat. It is larger in size than the Cantonese version.\n\nIn northern-western China, Uyghur people of Xinjiang adapted the shaomai to two regional varieties. The southern Xinjiang recipes differ slightly from the northern version in terms of ingredients and method. The filling of the northern version consists of mutton or beef, along with green onion and radish, whereas the southern filling primarily uses glutinous rice with smaller amounts of mutton or beef. Minced meat from sheep ribs containing some fat is ideal.\n\nCalled the Yifeng shaomai in the south-eastern Jiangxi province, its distinct flavour comes from a blend of pork mince, bread flour, sesame seed powder, ground pepper and sugar. It is particularly popular in the area of Yifeng Tanshan Tianbao where it is one of the foods eaten during the Chinese New Year celebration.\n\nShanghai shaomai uses glutinous rice, pork mince, Chinese mushroom (otherwise known as shiitake) and onion. The mince, Chinese mushrooms and onion are stir-fried before being made into shaomai which may then also be steamed.\n\n\"Shūmai\" in Japan have shrimp as the main ingredient and neither pork nor beef is used in the dough. Compared to the Chinese shaomai which is usually minced, the meat in Japanese shumai is ground to a paste.\n\n\"Siomay\" or \"siomai\" (sometimes called somay) in Indonesia is pronounced the same way as its sisters and is usually a wonton wrapper, stuffed with filling and steamed. It is served also with steamed potatoes, tofu, hard boiled eggs, steamed bitter gourd and cabbages, all are sliced and topped with peanut sauce and \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce). Because the population of Indonesia is largely Muslim, pork siomay is rare and is usually made from various fish, most commonly wahoo or mackerel tuna. This variant is less common in Western countries.\n\n\"Siomai\" (Visayan and Tagalog: \"siyomay\") in the Philippines is often ground pork, beef, shrimp, among others, combined with extenders like garlic, green peas, carrots and the like which is then wrapped in wonton wrappers. It is commonly steamed, with a popular variant being fried and resulting in a crisp exterior. It is normally dipped in soy sauce with squeezed calamansi (Philippine lime) juice, and a chili-garlic oil is sometimes added to the sauce.\n\nA recent variant on \"siomai\" is wrapped in sheets of laver after the wonton wrappers, which are marketed as \"Japanese.\"\n\n\"Xíu mại\" in Vietnam has minced pork, onion, scallion and shredded bread as the main ingredients and is cooked in tomato sauce. It is usually served in a \"bánh mì\" for breakfast.\n\nShaomai is considered to have originated in Huhhot, between the Ming and Qing dynasties. As described by historical materials, Shaomai was served in tea houses as a secondary product. The name was given \"捎卖\", meaning the product was \"sold as a sideline\", with tea. It is considered to have been brought to Beijing and Tianjin by merchants from Shanxi, causing its later widespread. The name was later transformed into modern forms like \"烧麦\", \"稍美\" and \"烧卖\", changing the characters while keeping the original pronunciation. The product was initially in the form of meat and vegetables wrapped in thin sheets, and was sold weighing only the wrapper, a tradition which is still kept in Huhhot.\n\nIn Huhhot, Shaomai is commonly served as a staple food, especially for breakfast.It is considered a local delicacy in regions around Huhhot.\nSteamed ones are served in steam tiers, and fried ones are served in dishes, with usually 8 per serving. Vinegar is commonly used as appetizer. The dish is commonly consumed with tea.\n\nWithin the dim sum tradition of southern China, \"shaomai\" is one of the most standard dishes. It is generally served alongside \"har gow\", another variety of steamed dumpling containing shrimp, cooked pork fat, bamboo shoots and scallions; collectively these are known as hargow-sieu mai (蝦餃燒賣). Chinese dishes are traditionally eaten using chopsticks.\n\nIn food stalls in Indonesia, \"siomai\" (or \"siomay\" in local dialect) are eaten together with steamed vegetables and tofu, and served with spicy peanut sauce.\n\nIn Philippine food stalls and fast food restaurants, \"siomai\" is eaten as is, with dip, toothpicks to facilitate handling, or with rice (using a spoon and fork).\n\n"}

Recipes vary greatly and can be desserts or savoury courses. They are typically boiled or steamed, though some baked variations and recipes adapted for microwave ovens exist.\n\nExamples include spotted dick, Christmas pudding, treacle pudding, clootie, jam roly-poly and many others. Savoury versions include rabbit, chicken, game and steak and kidney pudding.\n\nThe Paignton pudding was also a variation of suet pudding.\n\nThe suet pudding dates back to at least the start of the 18th century. Mary Kettilby's 1714 \"A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery\" gives a receipt for \"An excellent Plumb-Pudding\", which calls for \"one pound of Suet, shred very small and sifted\" along with raisins, flour, sugar, eggs, and a little salt; these were to be boiled for \"four hours at least\".\n\nChristmas pudding developed from a meat dish. The ancestor of the suet pudding was pottage, a meat and vegetable stew originating in Roman times. This was prepared in a large cauldron, the ingredients being slow cooked, with dried fruits, sugar and spices added. In the 15th century, Plum pottage was a sloppy mix of meat, vegetables and fruit served at the beginning of a meal.\n\nThe name suet pudding refers to the fat mixed with the flour; it is the fat from around the kidneys of mammals. Pudding is a British term for foods using this pastry, and the dishes can be sweet deserts or savory dishes.\n\nIn George Orwell's 1947 essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys,\" recounting the miseries of his preparatory school education, St Cyprian's School saves money by serving distasteful unsweetened suet pudding as a first course to \"break the boys' appetites.\"\n\nIn his 1941 essay \"England Your England\" he has a more benign view of it:\n\n"}

The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, stirring constantly, until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are pureed in a food processor with some of the liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set for a couple of hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set in the same manner as the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried. It may also be sliced and dried to make crackers for deep frying.

In chapter 49 he writes,\n\nPickled walnuts are also mentioned in Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh.\n\nPickled walnuts are still commonly eaten in England, particularly at Christmas served with an English blue cheese such as Stilton. They are also used in recipes, commonly cooked in beef dishes.\n\nPickled walnuts are made from the fruit of both common walnut tree varieties: \"Juglans regia\", the Persian, royal, English or common walnut, and \"Juglans nigra\", the black or American walnut.\n\nThe first stage is to pick the walnuts whilst they are still green and before the shells have set. Most recipes say that late June is about the best time to pick them. The soft walnuts are then soaked in brine (salt water) for at least ten days. The walnuts are then drained and left to dry in the air. Soaking the walnuts in brine causes a chemical reaction to take place and the walnuts turn dark brown to black in colour when exposed to sunlight. The now-black walnuts are then placed into jars and a pickling solution poured over them. This can vary from a straightforward pickling vinegar to a solution containing spices and sugar. The walnuts are sealed and then left in the jars for anywhere between five days and eight weeks depending on which recipe is followed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9576227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9576227", "title": "Baojia system", "text": "Baojia system\n\nThe baojia system () was an invention of Wang Anshi of the Song dynasty, who created this community-based system of law enforcement and civil control that was included in his large reform of Chinese government (\"the New Policies\") from 1069–1076.\n\nThe leaders of the baos were given authority to maintain local order, collect taxes, and organize civil projects. The idea of the system was that it would diminish the government's reliance on mercenaries, and that it would instead assign responsibility of law enforcement to these civil societies. Baojia regulations were issued centrally in 1548, during the Ming dynasty, but the system was not mandatory. Rather, the regulations were more like guidelines for officials who wished to deploy the system in their counties.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the baojia system was expanded across all of China. However, Ju Dongzu has written that the system was \"on the whole ineffective\" during this time, and \"remained a formality\" for several centuries after its introduction.\n\nBeing primarily the system of self-defense, in 1885, \"baojia\" was extended to cover tax collection. This resulted in power abuses and local unrest.\n\nThe baojia system has continued to resonate with Chinese citizens during the 20th century. During the boycott of Japanese products that occurred during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, students modeled their resistance on the baojia system. Ten people swore a collective oath to boycott Japanese products, and to make sure that the other nine members of their group upheld their oath. Each member of the group was to attempt to convert nine outsiders to the cause, forming ten groups of ten, which could come together as a group of one hundred. Finally, ten groups of one hundred could meet to form a one thousand person brigade. As with the traditional baojia system, one member of each group of ten became leader of the group. Although no functional group of one thousand ever existed, there is evidence that the ten person groups played an important role in carrying out the boycott.\n\nDuring the later Republic of China era, Chiang Kai-shek pressed for the reintroduction of the baojia system. He Yingqin argued that the baojia system could be used as the basis for the switch from a mercenary to a compulsory military service. The system had some success, but there was great difficulty in finding qualified and willing \"baozhang\", as the position was unpaid.\n\nThe Japanese also revived the baojia (in Japanese, Tonarigumi) system in Manchukuo on December 22, 1933. In this case, the system's primary purpose was to monitor and control the Chinese citizens. The government instituted a \"lianzuo\" punishment system, in which crimes committed by one family in a \"pai\" would result in punishment for all ten families in that \"pai\". This gave the \"paizhang\" a large incentives to monitor the other families in his \"pai\". The Tonarihumi system was also a self-defense unit and an operational mutual responsibility and surveillance organization. This system lasted until 1937, when the all-out war being waged in East Asia forced the Japanese government to consider more direct and centralized control schemes. On December 1, 1937, a new district and village government system was announced.\n\nIn Taiwan under Japanese rule, the baojia system inherited from the Qing government was adapted into the Hoko system. The system was an effective mechanism in producing domestic stability and social order for the Japanese government.\n\nThe structure of the baojia system changed over time. In Wang Anshi's original system, its basic unit was the \"bao\" (watch), which consisted of ten families. However, during the Ming dynasty, this ten family unit was instead labeled a \"jia\" (tithing), and ten \"jia\" (or one hundred families) made a \"bao\". Each \"jia\" possessed a placard that rotated among the families. The family holding it at a given time was the \"jiazhang\", or tithing captain. Similarly, the captain of the \"bao\" was the \"baozhang\".\n\nThere was a great deal of regional variation in the system. In some areas, \"jia\" had as few as four families or as many as thirteen. Some Jiangnan counties added an intermediary unit called the \"dang\" (compact). This unit consisted of thirty families and had a corresponding \"dangzhang\".\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the system's structure changed again. Ten households made up one \"pai\", ten \"pai\" constituted one \"jia\", and every ten \"jia\" formed a \"bao\". Studies by Philip Huang and Wang Fuming of Baodi County in northeastern Hebei province (now Baodi District, Tianjin) have shown that the lowest quasi-official was the \"xiangbao\", who oversaw about twenty villages and was intended to act as a buffer between the people and the government.\n\nWhen the system was reimplemented in the Republic of China, the structure remained essentially the same, with the exception of the introduction of the \"lianbao\" (associated \"bao\"), a group of several \"bao\" at the district level.\n"}
{"id": "9578721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9578721", "title": "Polish heroin", "text": "Polish heroin\n\n\"Polish\" heroin (also kompot and compote in drug culture slang) is a crude preparation of heroin made from poppy straw. It is an addictive opiate, used recreationally as a psychoactive drug. Poppy straw, like opium, is harvested from the opium poppy (\"Papaver somniferum\"). Polish heroin was used mainly in Central and Eastern Europe prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of communist control of the countries of the Warsaw Pact or Eastern Bloc.\n\nWhile related to opium, Polish heroin more nearly resembles poppy tea in its impurity, but can be very potent. This drug was also considered by Eastern Bloc addicts to be one of last resort when refined heroin, morphine, or other similar drugs were unavailable, as was often the case during the 1950s through the end of the Soviet era. Illicit drug trafficking and clandestine drug manufacture within the communist-governed nations of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia itself, and others was on a much smaller scale and the supply far more erratic and unreliable compared to that of Western nations. Opium poppies, by contrast, were widely available and relatively inexpensive. The drug has been known as early as the 1940s. The drug in its finished state is a bitter brown fluid looking like tea or cola in color.\n\nPolish heroin contains diacetylmorphine (heroin), 6-monoacetylmorphine (active metabolite of heroin), 3-monoacetylmorphine (less-active metabolite of heroin), morphine and small amounts of codeine. The amount of opiates can be high provided that the end product is not overly diluted during production, but the amount of diacetylmorphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine created depends on the skills of people making it and the time and conditions of acetylation.\n\nThe use of the term \"kompot\" or compote refers euphemistically to \"kompot\", a traditional compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed fruit, spices, and sugar. The so-called \"kompot\" method of making a crude opiate \"cocktail\" intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like \"kompot\" is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange resin, acetone, ammonia water and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium poppy pods and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of ammonia water. The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called \"glazura\" - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used in the beginning of the process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, \"kompot\" extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock.\n\nPolish heroin has been in declining use since the break-up of the Soviet Union and its Central and Eastern European satellite states (Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, et al.) as after 1991 the availability of heroin and other drugs smuggled into those countries from abroad increased enormously. Since then, \"kompot\"/\"Polish heroin\" has all but disappeared, except in a few rural areas where cheaper, purer, more potent drugs have not overwhelmed the illicit marketplace.\n\n"}

A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavored with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chili peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and so on. Outside South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.\n\nIndian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through. In South India, coconut and curry leaves are also popular ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. Even within the country, there are variations among regions. In Northern India, where the delicacy may be cooked with extra spice. Additionally, one can find the dish in several small shops as well as five-star restaurants. Depending on the style of preparation, some versions may be sweeter while others will have a creamier taste to them due to the ample use of butter and cashew nut paste.\n\nThis dish was introduced to Trinidad and Tobago by indentured Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces. However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available, the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. As Trinidadians continued to find their own identity in the world, new curry chicken type dishes began forming. \"Curry goat\" and \"curry duck\" have become widely popular. Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, Grenada, and other Caribbean territories with Indian and South Asian influence.\n\nThere are many types of chicken curry in South East Asia. Although most chicken curry comes from India, some other types come from areas close to India also. But all of its origins begin in India. Different countries, as well as the different communities within these countries, produce variations of the curry. Malaysian curry chicken is usually cooked in coconut milk and often contain potatoes, and there are dry and wet versions. In Thailand, chicken may be cooked in green curry, red curry or other varieties of Thai curry.\n\nCountry captain chicken is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern United States. The Hobson-Jobson Dictionary states the following:\n\nThis dish dates back to the early 1800s. A British sea captain stationed in Bengal, India, shared the recipe for this dish with some friends at the major shipping port in Savannah, Georgia. \n\nIn 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from Warm Springs, Georgia served this dish under the name \"Country Captain\" to Franklin D. Roosevelt (the 32nd president of the United States of America) and to General George S. Patton (a distinguished U.S. Army General). Their warm praise and keen liking and love of this dish were factors in reforging the Southern United States classic status. Roosevelt was so fond of Warm Springs, Georgia, that he built his only self-owned home in Warm Springs. It was a medium-sized, six room cottage, that he liked to call \"The Little White House\".\n"}

Described by whiskey writer Jim Murray as \"unquestionably one of the world's great whiskeys\", Green Spot is one of the few remaining bonded Irish whiskeys. Along with Mitchell's older bottling, Yellow Spot, it is one of only two whiskeys specifically produced for and sold by an independent wine merchant in Ireland.\n\nIn 1805, William Mitchell established a bakery and confectionery business on Dublin's Grafton Street. In 1887, the business expanded into the wine and spirit trade at a location on nearby Kildare Street. At the time, it was common practice in Ireland for merchants to purchase distillate in bulk from whiskey distilleries and then mature it themselves in their own casks in bonded warehouses. The merchants had ample supplies of casks due to the importation of wine and fortified wines such as port and sherry. Therefore, it was a natural progression for Mitchell & Son to enter the bonded whiskey trade.\n\nUsing distillate obtained from Jameson's nearby Bow Street Distillery, Mitchell & Son matured whiskey in a mix of casks that had been used to hold both dark and light sherries in their cellars under Fitzwilliam Lane in Dublin. For the first five years of maturation, half of the whiskey was aged in casks that had previously held Oloroso and other darker sherries, with the other half aged in casks that had held lighter finos. This combination prevented the darker wines from overpowering the whiskey. After five years, whiskeys from the respective light and dark sherry casks were then vatted together and allowed to mature for an additional five years in neutral oak.\n\nMitchell & Son's whiskey was originally marketed as \"Pat Whisky\", with the labels featuring the logo of a man on a green background. However, in 1933, it was rebranded as \"John Jameson & Son 10 Year Old Green Seal\" and later became known simply as Green Spot.\n\nMitchell & Son sold a range of whiskeys under the \"Spot\" brand. The name itself originated from Mitchell's practice of marking casks of different ages with a spot of colored paint. There was a 7-year-old Blue Spot, a 12-year-old Yellow Spot, and a 15-year-old Red Spot. However, it was the 10-year-old Green Spot that emerged as the company's most popular whiskey, and it was the only Spot whiskey to remain in continuous production until the present. Although it relaunched in 2012, Yellow Spot ceased bottling for decades in the late 1950s. According to posts on the Irish Whiskey Club's Facebook page in August 2018, Red Spot is set to be relaunched, possibly in October 2018.\n\nIn 1971, Irish Distillers closed its Dublin distilleries (including Bow Street) and consolidated production in Midleton. As a result, the makeup of the whiskey was altered for the first time in known history. This change, coupled with low stocks of maturing whiskey, led Mitchell & Son to make an agreement with Irish Distillers to mature the whiskey onsite in Irish Distillers' own casks, with Mitchell & Son having sole rights to market, sell, and develop the whiskey.\n\nModern Green Spot is slightly younger than the original. Previously a 10-year-old whiskey, it is now a non-age statement whiskey, made from a blend of 7-10-year-old single pot still whiskeys that have matured in a combination of new and refill bourbon casks and sherry casks.\n\nBecause Green Spot is produced in limited quantities (only 12,000 bottles per year) and was historically mainly sold through Mitchell's & Son's Dublin shop, it was previously difficult to obtain outside of Ireland. However, in recent years, distribution of Green Spot has become more widespread. For instance, it was launched in the United States for the first time in 2014 and is now available in retailers across France.\n\nIn recent years, three special bottlings of Green Spot have been released:\n\nIn May 2012, Mitchell & Son re-introduced the Yellow Spot variant based on information in company archives. Bottling of Yellow Spot had previously ceased in the 1950s, but information in original company journals and ledgers allowed Mitchell & Son to determine the original Yellow Spot was a blend of 12-year-old pot still whiskeys that were matured in a combination of Malaga wine casks (which impart a slightly sweet taste), bourbon barrels, and sherry butts.\n\nAlthough Malaga-matured Irish pot still whiskey is a rarity in modern production, when Mitchell & Son checked Irish Distillers' inventory, it found a supply of 12-year-old Malaga-matured pot still whiskey. This allowed Mitchell & Son to re-launch Yellow Spot using the same style of whiskey that was contained in the original.\n\nWhen Mitchell & Son initially relaunched Yellow Spot, the plan was to produce limited batches of 500 cases per annum.\n\nRed Spot was re-introduced to the lineup in November of 2018, again based on old family recipes from before it was discontinued 50 years prior. This bottling is aged in bourbon barrels and sherry butts much like the other Spot Whiskeys, but with the addition of Marsala wine casks as well for a total of at least 15 years.\n\nGreen Spot has received high scores at several international spirit ratings competitions. For instance, Jim Murray, author of the \"Whisky Bible\", rated Green Spot as 94.5/100 in the 2014 edition of the \"Whisky Bible\". In addition, Murray has stated that Green Spot is:\"“...to the true Irish whiskey drinker what the Irish Round Tower is to the archaeologist...Unquestionably one of the world’s great whiskies.”\"More recently, the Green Spot Château Léoville Barton was awarded \"Best single pot still whiskey\" at the 2016 World Whiskies Awards.\n\nBoth Green Spot and Yellow Spot are among a handful of single pot still whiskeys in existence today, with Green Spot being the only one to have remained in continuous production since the early 1900s. (Redbreast, the other long established Irish single pot still whiskey, briefly ceased production in the 1980s). Although once the most popular style of whiskey consumed in the world, pot still whiskey fell out of favor in the 20th century, due in part to the rise of cheaper, less intense blended whiskeys. As a result of declining demand, most Irish whiskeys were either reformulated as blends or discontinued.\n\nSingle pot still whiskeys, which are historically unique to Ireland, are similar to single malts in that they are produced solely from pot still distillate. However, in contrast to malts that only use malted barley in the mash, single pot still whiskeys are produced from a mixed mash that contains both malted and unmalted barley.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9633405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9633405", "title": "Powers (whiskey)", "text": "Powers (whiskey)\n\nPowers is a brand of Irish whiskey. Historically a single pot still whiskey, the flagship \"Powers Gold Label\" brand was the first Irish whiskey ever to be bottled. In recent years, several single pot still variants have been relaunched under the Powers label.\n\nHistorically, Powers Gold Label was the best selling whiskey in Ireland.\n\nIn 1791 James Power, an innkeeper from Dublin, established a small distillery at his public house at 109 Thomas St., Dublin. The distillery, which had an output of about 6,000 gallons in its first year of operation, initially traded as James Power and Son, but by 1822 had become John Power & Son, and had moved to a new premises at John's Lane, a side street off Thomas Street. At the time the distillery had three pot stills, though only one, a 500-gallon still is thought to have been in use.\n\nFollowing reform of the distilling laws in 1823, the distillery expanded rapidly. In 1827, production was reported at 160,270 gallons, and by 1833 had grown to 300,000 gallons per annum.\n\nAs the distillery grew, so too did the stature of the family. In 1841, John Power, grandson of the founder was awarded a baronet, a hereditary title. In 1855, his son Sir James Power, laid the foundation stone for the O'Connell Monument, and in 1859 became High Sheriff of Dublin.\n\nIn 1871, the distillery was expanded and rebuilt in the Victorian style, becoming one of the most impressive sights in Dublin. After expansion, output at the distillery rose to 700,000 gallons per annum, and by the 1880s, had reached about 900,000 gallons per annum, at which point the distillery covered over six acres of central Dublin, and had a staff of about 300 people.\n\nDuring this period, when the Dublin whiskey distilleries were amongst the largest in the world, the family run firms of John Powers, along with John Jameson, William Jameson, and George Roe, (collectively known as the \"Big Four\") came to dominate the Irish distilling landscape, introducing several innovations. In 1886, John Power & Son began bottling their own whiskey, rather than following the practice customary at the time, of selling whiskey directly to merchants and bonders who would bottle it themselves. They were the first Dublin distillery to do so, and one of the first in the world. A gold label adorned each bottle and it was from these that the whiskey got the name \"Powers Gold Label\".\n\nWhen Alfred Barnard, the British historian visited John's Lane in the late 1880s, he noted the elegance and cleanliness of the buildings, and the modernity of the distillery, describing it as \"about as complete a work as it is possible to find anywhere\". At the time of his visit, the distillery was home to five pot stills, two of which with capacities of 25,000 gallons, were amongst the largest ever built. In addition, Barnard was high in his praise for Powers whiskey, noting:\"The old make, which we drank with our luncheon, was delicious, and finer than anything we had hitherto tasted. It was as perfect in flavour, and as pronounced in the ancient aroma of Irish Whisky so dear to the hearts of connoisseurs, as one could possibly desire, and we found a small flask of it very useful afterwards on our travels.\"The last member of the family to sit on the board was Sir Thomas Talbot Power, who died in 1930, and with him the Power's Baronetcy. However, ownership remained in the family until 1966, and several descendants of his sisters remained at work with the company until recent times.\n\nIn 1961, a Coffey still was installed in John's Lane Distillery, allowing the production of vodka and gin, in addition to the testing of grain whiskey for use in blended whiskey. This was a notable departure for the firm, as for many years the big Dublin distilling dynasties had shunned the use of Coffey stills, questioning if their output, grain whiskey could even be termed whiskey. However, with many of the Irish distilleries having closed in the early 20th century in part due to their failure to embrace a change in consumer preference towards blended whiskey, Powers were instrumental in convincing the remaining Irish distilleries to reconsider their stance on blended whiskey.\n\nIn 1966, with the Irish whiskey industry still struggling following Prohibition in the United States, the Anglo-Irish Trade War and the rise of competition from Scotch whiskey, John Powers & Son joined forces with the only other remaining distillers in the Irish Republic, the Cork Distilleries Company and their Dublin rivals John Jameson & Son, to form Irish Distillers. Soon after, in a bold move, Irish Distillers decided to close all of their existing distilleries, and to consolidate production at a new purpose-built facility in Midleton (the New Midleton Distillery) alongside their existing Old Midleton Distillery. The new distillery opened in 1975, and a year later, production ceased at John's Lane Distillery and began anew in Cork, with Powers Gold Label and many other Irish whiskeys reformulated from single pot stills whiskeys to blends.\n\nIn 1989, Irish Distillers itself became a subsidiary of Pernod-Ricard following a friendly takeover.\n\nSince the closure of the John's Lane distillery, many of the distillery buildings were demolished. However, some of the buildings have been incorporated into the National College of Art and Design, and are now protected structures. In addition, three of the distillery's pot stills were saved and now located in the college's Red Square.\n\nIn addition to Powers Gold label, a 12-year old premium blend, and several single pot still whiskeys have been released under the Powers banner in recent years:\n\nIn the 2012 edition of the \"Whisky Bible\", whiskey writer Jim Murray named Power's John's Lane Release \"Irish Whiskey of the Year\" and described it as \"certainly one of the top five world whiskies of the year\".\n\nMore recently, in 2015, Powers Signature Release won a Gold Medal in the category \"Irish Single Pot Still Whiskey\" at the Irish Whiskey Awards.\n\n\n"}

One of the most expensive whiskeys regularly produced by Irish Distillers, since its launch in 1984, Midleton Very Rare has frequently been the recipient of strong reviews and awards.\n\nEach year, a new bottling is specially created by the Master Distiller at the Midleton Distillery, using whiskeys handpicked from the distillery's warehouses. Barry Crockett, the Master Distiller who created the whiskey, and oversaw its production until he retired in 2013, stated that his objective each year was \"to produce the best whiskey possible\". The fact that each vintage differs, and is only released in very limited quantities (typically less than 2,500 cases per annum), makes the whiskey both collectible and expensive.\n\nEach bottle is individually numbered and signed by the Master Distiller, and sold in an accompanying wooden display case.\n\nIn recent years several single pot still whiskeys have been released under the \"Midleton\" banner alongside Midleton Very Rare.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Irish Distillers which owned several distilleries in Ireland, decided to close most of their existing distilleries and to consolidate production at a new purpose-built facility in Midleton. Therefore, as the new distillery needed to replicate several different existing whiskeys it became home to a wide range of maturing whiskey stocks.\n\nIn 1984, Midleton Very Rare was launched to celebrate the whiskeys produced in Midleton. As the new distillery had only been open for about a decade at that stage, the initial vintages contained whiskey from the neighbouring Old Midleton Distillery, which closed when the new distillery opened. However, the newer vintages are produced from whiskeys distilled in the new distillery.\n\nIn September 2014, to commemorate the 30th or Pearl anniversary of Midleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey, Midleton Distillery invited their Master Distiller Emeritus Barry Crockett out of retirement to join his successor and current Master Distiller Brian Nation in producing a special anniversary edition. The whiskey, \"Midleton Very Rare 30th Anniversary Pearl Edition\", was a limited to just 117 bottles, and released at a higher strength (53.1% ABV) than the original.\n\nIn addition to Midleton Very Rare (a blend), several single pot still whiskeys have been released under the \"Midleton\" banner throughout the years:\nRecently, a Midleton single pot still variant was released as an ongoing bottling to celebrate the career of Barry Crockett, the former Master Distiller at Midleton.

It is practiced in North India, taking place in four towns in particular:\n\nThe tradition was first established in 234 BC in Bareilly.\n\nThe towns were first determined by the first cattle of the first march's step. The direction of the step decided the direction of the town and the number of steps decided the distance of the town (one step being equal to 100 miles).\nOriginally, the towns were vast fields of grass and sand; the tradition marked them as places of interest, and so brought about many Hindus, many of whom decided to stay and so towns were set up.\n\nThe actual tradition was started when a guru of a local Mandir in Bareilly decided to pour blessed rosewater over a sacred cow. The cow was deemed sacred as it had provided milk for a baby whose mother had died of malaria. According to the stories passed down generations, the cow began to float. It cried the Goddess of beauty's rāga. The guru kissed the cow on the top of the head, and later went on to live to the age of 130 as he was blessed. The tradition today is thousands of Hindus every two years commuting to the chosen town, typically by foot. A heard of female cattle walk on a circular field of flowers, which has a diameter of approximately 3 miles. They walk through the Falgu river, in Gaya, the river is often diluted with many litres of rosewater, in remembrance of Shringa-Sthan Gauri, the Guru who witnessed the sacred cow who was named Brahman, after the child she had fed.\n"}

Areas where kenkey is eaten are Ghana, eastern Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, western Benin, Guyana (where it is known as \"konkee\"), and Jamaica. It is usually made from ground corn (maize), like sadza and ugali. It is also known in Jamaica as dokunoo, dokono, dokunu (the Asante refer to the same dish as \"dɔkono\"), blue drawers, and tie-a-leaf. In Trinidad it is called \"paime\" (pronounced pay-me) and differs in that it does not contain plantain but may include pumpkin and coconut. In the cuisine of the Caribbean, it is made with cornmeal, plantain, green banana, sweet potato (Asante and Jamaican version, which came from the Asante version) or cassava, wrapped in banana leaves. The food is derived from African cooking traditions.\n\nUnlike ugali, making kenkey involves letting the maize ferment before cooking. Therefore, preparation takes a few days in order to let the dough ferment. After fermentation, the kenkey is partially cooked, wrapped in banana leaves, corn husks, or foil, and steamed. There are several versions of kenkey, such as Ga and Fante kenkey. The Ga kenkey is more common in most parts of Ghana.\n\n\nIn a large container combine the cornflour (or cornflour and grated cassava) with just enough warm water to dampen all of it. Mix well. Cover the container with a clean cloth. Set it in a warm place, such as a warmed oven or on top of the refrigerator, for two to three days or more for best results. Fermentation may take longer than two days, especially in cool climates. (Note: a warmed oven is an oven that has been heated for a few minutes and turned off. The flour should ferment, not cook). When it is properly fermented, it should have a slightly sour, but not unpleasant, aroma, like rising bread dough. Overly fermented cornflour will not taste right.\n\nPrepare the cornflour as described above, and let it ferment for about six hours. Then mix one tablespoon of vinegar into the wet cornflour.\n\nSoak the dry corn in water. After three days, drain and wash the corn in fresh water. Grind it and add some water to make it into a dough with a smooth surface. Keep it in a warm place to ferment for two to three days before using it to prepare the kenkey. Before using it for the preparation, the moldy surface on top should be removed and discarded.\n\nThe water in which the kenkey is boiled serves as a drink when maize or corn husks are used as the wrapper for cooking the kenkey. This water is called \"\"otinshi nu\"\".\n\nNote: Ready-to-use fermented cornmeal dough made especially for banku and kenkey may be available at African grocery stores and should be prepared according to package instructions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9690068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9690068", "title": "Sleep medicine", "text": "Sleep medicine\n\nSleep medicine is a medical specialty or subspecialty devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances and disorders. From the middle of the 20th century, research has provided increasing knowledge and answered many questions about sleep-wake functioning. The rapidly evolving field has become a recognized medical subspecialty in some countries. Dental sleep medicine also qualifies for board certification in some countries. Properly organized, minimum 12-month, postgraduate training programs are still being defined in the United States. In some countries, the sleep researchers and the physicians who treat patients may be the same people.\n\nThe first sleep clinics in the United States were established in the 1970s by interested physicians and technicians; the study, diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea were their first tasks. As late as 1999, virtually any American physician, with no specific training in sleep medicine, could open a sleep laboratory.\n\nDisorders and disturbances of sleep are widespread and can have significant consequences for affected individuals as well as economic and other consequences for society. The US National Transportation Safety Board has, according to Dr. Charles Czeisler, member of the Institute of Medicine and Director of the Harvard University Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, discovered that the leading cause (31%) of fatal-to-the-driver heavy truck crashes is fatigue related, (though rarely associated directly with sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea), with drugs and alcohol as the number two cause (29%). Sleep deprivation has also been a significant factor in dramatic accidents, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the nuclear incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and the explosion of the space shuttle \"Challenger\".\n\nCompetence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a plethora of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional sleep deprivation, \"is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder,\" such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, menstrual-related hypersomnia, idiopathic recurrent stupor, or circadian rhythm disturbances. Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms that can have many causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.\n\nICSD, \"The International Classification of Sleep Disorders\", was restructured in 1990, in relation to its predecessor, to include only one code for each diagnostic entry and to classify disorders by pathophysiologic mechanism, as far as possible, rather than by primary complaint. Training in sleep medicine is multidisciplinary, and the present structure was chosen to encourage a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis. Sleep disorders often do not fit neatly into traditional classification; differential diagnoses cross medical systems. Minor revisions and updates to the ICSD were made in 1997 and in following years. The present classification system in fact follows the groupings suggested by Nathaniel Kleitman, the \"father of sleep research,\" in his seminal 1939 book \"Sleep and Wakefulness\".\n\nThe revised ICSD, ICSD-R, placed the primary sleep disorders in the subgroups (1) dyssomnias, which include those that produce complaints of insomnia or excessive sleepiness, and (2) the parasomnias, which do not produce those primary complaints but intrude into or occur during sleep. A further subdivision of the dyssomnias preserves the integrity of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as was mandated by about 200 doctors and researchers from all over the world who participated in the process between 1985–1990. The last two subgroups were (3) the medical or psychiatric sleep disorder section and (4) the proposed new disorders section. The authors found the heading \"medical or psychiatric\" less than ideal but better than the alternative \"organic or non-organic,\" which seemed more likely to change in the future. Detailed reporting schemes aimed to provide data for further research. A second edition, called ICSD-2, was published in 2005.\n\nMeSH, \"Medical Subject Headings\", a service of the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, uses similar broad categories: (1) dyssomnias, including narcolepsy, apnea, and the circadian rhythm sleep disorders, (2) parasomnias, which include, among others, bruxism (tooth-grinding), sleepwalking and bedwetting, and (3) sleep disorders caused by medical or psychiatric conditions. The system used produces \"trees,\" approaching each diagnosis from up to several angles such that each disorder may be known by several codes.\n\nDSM-IV-TR, the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision\", using the same diagnostic codes as the \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\" (ICD), divides sleep disorders into three groups: (1) primary sleep disorders, both the dyssomnias and the parasomnias, presumed to result from an endogenous disturbance in sleep-wake generating or timing mechanisms, (2) those secondary to mental disorders and (3) those related to a general medical condition or substance abuse.\n\nRecent thinking opens for a common cause for mood and sleep disorders occurring in the same patient; a 2010 review states that, in humans, \"single nucleotide polymorphisms in \"Clock\" and other clock genes have been associated with depression\" and that the \"evidence that mood disorders are associated with disrupted or at least inappropriately timed circadian rhythms suggests that treatment strategies or drugs aimed at restoring 'normal' circadian rhythmicity may be clinically useful.\"\n\nA 16th-century physician wrote that many laborers dozed off exhausted at the start of each night; sexual intercourse with their wives typically occurring in the \"watching period\", after a recuperative first sleep. Anthropologists find that isolated societies without electric light sleep in a variety of patterns; seldom do they resemble our modern habit of sleeping in one single eight-hour bout. Much has been written about dream interpretation, from biblical times to Freud, but sleep itself was historically seen as a passive state of not-awake.\n\nThe concept of sleep medicine belongs to the second half of the 20th century. Due to the rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep, including the growth of the research field chronobiology from about 1960 and the discoveries of REM sleep (1952–53) and sleep apnea (first described in the medical literature in 1965), the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, and in many western nations within the two following decades, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and the treatment of its disorders had been founded. Most sleep doctors were primarily concerned with apnea; some were experts in narcolepsy. There was as yet nothing to restrict the use of the title \"sleep doctor,\" and a need for standards arose.\n\nBasic medical training has paid little attention to sleep problems; according to Benca in her review \"Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia\" (2005), most doctors are \"not well trained with respect to sleep and sleep disorders,\" and a survey in 1990–91 of 37 American medical schools showed that sleep and sleep disorders were \"covered\" in less than two (2) hours of total teaching time, on average. Benca's review cites a 2002 survey by Papp et al. of more than 500 primary care physicians who self-reported their knowledge of sleep disorders as follows: Excellent – 0%; Good – 10%, Fair – 60%; and Poor – 30%. The review of more than 50 studies indicates that both doctors and patients appear reluctant to discuss sleep complaints, in part because of perceptions that treatments for insomnia are ineffective or associated with risks, and:\nAlso, an editorial in the American College of Chest Physicians' (pulmonologists') journal \"CHEST\" in 1999 was quite concerned about the \"Conundrums in Sleep Medicine\". The author, then chair of her organization's Sleep Section, asked \"What is required to set up a sleep laboratory? Money and a building! Anyone can open a sleep laboratory, and it seems that just about everyone is.\" On the accreditation process for sleep laboratories, she continues: \"This accreditation, however, is currently not required by most states, or more importantly, by most insurance carriers for reimbursements... There is also an American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM) that certifies individuals as sleep specialists. This certification presumably makes those individuals more qualified to run a sleep laboratory; however, the certification is not required to run a laboratory or to read sleep studies.\" Her concern at the turn of the century was:\nIn the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag. Guardian.co.uk quotes the director of the Imperial College Healthcare Sleep Centre: \"One problem is that there has been relatively little training in sleep medicine in this country – certainly there is no structured training for sleep physicians.\" The Imperial College Healthcare site shows attention to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and very few other disorders, specifically not including insomnia.\n\nThe World Federation of Sleep Research & Sleep Medicine Societies (WFSRSMS) was founded in 1987. As its name implies, members are concerned with basic and clinical research as well as medicine. Member societies in the Americas are the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), the Sleep Research Society of the United States (SRS), the Canadian Sleep Society (CSS) and the Federation of Latin American Sleep Societies (FLASS). WFSRSMS publishes the \"Journal of Sleep Research\", the \"Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine\", \"SLEEP\" and \"Sleep and Biological Rhythms\" and promotes both sleep research and physician training and education.\n\nThe Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA) provide the well-defined specialty Diploma in Sleep Medicine of the College of Neurologists of South Africa: DSM(SA), which was first promulgated by the Health Professions Council in 2007. The newly formed South African Society of Sleep Medicine (SASSM) was launched at its inaugural congress in February 2010. The society's membership is diverse; it includes general practitioners, ENT surgeons, pulmonologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists and psychiatrists.\n\nWFSRSMS members in Asia include the Australasian Sleep Association (ASA) of New Zealand and Australia and the Asian Sleep Research Society (ASRS), an umbrella organization for the societies of several Asian nations.\n\nThe European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) is a member of the WFSRSMS. The Assembly of National Sleep Societies (ANSS), which includes both medical and scientific organizations from 26 countries as of 2007, is a formal body of the ESRS. The ESRS has published \"European Accreditation Guidelines for SMCs\" (Sleep Medicine Centres), the first of several proposed guidelines to coordinate and promote sleep science and medicine in Europe.\n\nThe American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), founded in 1978, administered the certification process and sleep medicine examination for doctors until 1990. Its independent daughter entity the American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM) was incorporated in 1991 and took over the aforementioned responsibilities. As of 2007, the ABSM ceased administering its examination, as it conceded that an examination process recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) was advantageous to the field. Candidates who passed the ABSM exam in 1978–2006 retain lifetime certification as Diplomates of that organization.\n\nThe American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN), and the corresponding boards of Internal Medicine, of Pediatrics, and of Otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, ENT) now administer collectively the Sleep Medicine Certification exam for their members. Each board supervises the required 12 months of formal training for its candidates, while the exam is administered to all of them at the same time in the same place. For the first five years, 2007–2011, during \"grandfathering,\" there was a \"practice pathway\" for ABSM certified specialists while additional, coordinated requirements were to be added after 2011. The ABPN provides information about the pathways, requirements and the exam on its website. Additionally, there are currently four boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists that administer Sleep Medicine Certification exams. The American Osteopathic boards of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurology & Psychiatry, and Ophthalmology & Otolaryngology grant certificates of added qualification to qualified candidate physicians.\n\nSleep medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within anesthesiology, internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, otolaryngology, psychiatry and neurology in the US. Certification in Sleep Medicine by the several \"Member Boards\" of the ABMS shows that the specialist:\nPulmonologists, already subspecialists within internal medicine, may be accepted to sit for the board and be certified in Sleep Medicine after just a six-month fellowship, building on their knowledge of sleep-related breathing problems, rather than the usual twelve-month fellowship required of other specialists.\n\nSleep dentistry (bruxism, snoring and sleep apnea), while not recognized as one of the nine dental specialties, qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the AASM, and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA). The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep doctors at accredited sleep centers and can provide several types of oral appliances or upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders as well as tooth-grinding and clenching.\n\nLaboratories for sleep-related breathing disorders are accredited by the AASM, and are required to follow the \"Code of Medical Ethics\" of the American Medical Association. The new and very detailed \"Standards for Accreditation\" are available online. Sleep disorder centers, or clinics, are accredited by the same body, whether hospital-based, university-based or \"freestanding\"; they are required to provide testing and treatment for \"all\" sleep disorders and to have on staff a sleep specialist who has been certified by the American Board of Sleep Medicine and otherwise meet similar standards.\n\nThe taking of a thorough medical history while keeping in mind alternative diagnoses and the possibility of more than one ailment in the same patient is the first step. Symptoms for very different sleep disorders may be similar and it must be determined whether any psychiatric problems are primary or secondary.\n\nThe patient history includes previous attempts at treatment and coping and a careful medication review. Differentiation of transient from chronic disorders and primary from secondary ones influences the direction of evaluation and treatment plans.\n\nThe Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), designed to give an indication of sleepiness and correlated with sleep apnea, or other questionnaires designed to measure excessive daytime sleepiness, are diagnostic tools that can be used repeatedly to measure results of treatment.\n\nA sleep diary, also called sleep log or sleep journal, kept by a patient at home for at least two weeks, while subjective, may help determine the extent and nature of sleep disturbance and the level of alertness in the normal environment. A parallel journal kept by a parent or bed partner, if any, can also be helpful. Sleep logs can also be used for self-monitoring and in connection with behavioral and other treatment. The image at the top of this page, with nighttime in the middle and the weekend in the middle, shows a layout that can aid in noticing trends\n\nAn actigraph unit is a motion-sensing device worn on the wrist, generally for one or two weeks. It gives a gross picture of sleep-wake cycles and is often used to verify the sleep diary. It is cost-efficient when full polysomnography is not required.\n\nPolysomnography is performed in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably at his or her usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.\n\nA Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is often performed during the entire day after polysomnography while the electrodes and other equipment are still in place. The patient is given nap opportunities every second hour; the test measures the number of minutes it takes from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep. It is a measure of daytime sleepiness; it also shows whether REM sleep is achieved in a short nap, a typical indication of narcolepsy.\n\nImaging studies may be performed if a patient is to be evaluated for neurodegenerative disease or to determine the obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nWhen sleep complaints are secondary to pain, other medical or psychiatric diagnoses, or substance abuse, it may be necessary to treat both the underlying cause and the sleep problems.\n\nWhen the underlying cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from patient education about sleep hygiene to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies of both younger and older adults have compared CBT to medication and found that CBT should be considered a first-line and cost-effective intervention for chronic insomnia, not least because gains may be maintained at long-term follow-up. Sleep physicians and psychologists, at least in the US, are not in agreement about who should perform CBT nor whether sleep centers should be required to have psychologists on staff. In the UK the number of CBT-trained therapists is limited so CBT is not widely available on the NHS.\n\nBehavioral therapies include progressive relaxation, stimulus control (to reassociate the bed with sleepiness), limiting time-in-bed to increase sleep efficiency and debunking misconceptions about sleep.\n\nPharmacotherapy is necessary for some conditions. Medication may be useful for acute insomnia and for some of the parasomnias. It is almost always needed, along with scheduled short naps and close follow-up, in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.\n\nChronic circadian rhythm disorders, the most common of which is delayed sleep phase disorder, may be managed by specifically-timed bright light therapy, usually in the morning, darkness therapy in the hours before bedtime, and timed oral administration of the hormone melatonin. Chronotherapy has also been prescribed for circadian rhythm disorders, though results are generally short-lived. Stimulants may also be prescribed. When these therapies are unsuccessful, counseling may be indicated to help a person adapt to and live with the condition. People with these disorders who have chosen a lifestyle in conformity with their sleeping schedules have no need of treatment, though they may need the diagnosis in order to avoid having to meet for appointments or meetings during their sleep time.\n\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines and oral appliances are used nightly at home to manage sleep-related breathing disorders such as apnea. In mild cases in obese people, weight reduction may be sufficient, but it is usually recommended as an adjunct to CPAP treatment since sustaining weight loss is difficult. In some cases, upper airway surgery, generally performed by an otolaryngologist/head & neck surgeon or occasionally an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, is indicated. The treatments prevent airway collapse, which interrupts breathing during sleep. A 2001 study published by Hans-Werner Gessmann in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Psychology found that patients who practiced a series of electrical stimulations of suprahyoidal tongue muscles for 20 minutes a day showed a marked decline in sleep apnea symptoms after two months. Patients experienced an average of 36% fewer apnea episodes after successfully completing the treatments. \n\n\n"}

They are usually eaten in bars or taverns as a small snack while hanging out with friends or relatives; thus, they have a strong socializing component, and in the Basque country and Navarre they are usually regarded as a cornerstone of local culture and society. They are related to tapas, the main difference being that pinchos are usually 'spiked' with a skewer or toothpick, often to a piece of bread. They are served in individual portions and always ordered and paid for independently from the drinks. It is not impossible, however, to have the same item called \"pincho\" in one place and \"tapa\" in another.\n\nThey are called \"pinchos\" because many of them have a \"pincho\" (Spanish for \"spike\"), typically a toothpick —or a skewer for the larger varieties— through them. They should not be confused with brochettes, which in Latin America and some parts of Spain are called \"pinchos\" too; in brochettes, the skewer or toothpick is needed in order to cook the food or keep it together.\n\nA typical snack of the Basque Country and Navarre, \"pinchos\" consist of small slices of bread upon which an ingredient or mixture of ingredients is placed and fastened with a toothpick, which gives the food its name \"pincho\", meaning \"spike.\" Pinchos are usually eaten as an appetizer, accompanied by a small glass of young white wine (called \"txikito\", ) or beer (\"zurito\", quarter of a pint). Pinchos are very common in the taverns of the Basque Country, and in other near areas, such as Cantabria, La Rioja, northern Burgos, and Navarre, where a variety of pinchos is usually served on a tray at the bar.\n\nIn this type of pinchos, the toothpick is used to keep ingredients from falling off the bread, as well as to keep track of the number of items that the customer has eaten. Sometimes, differently priced pinchos have toothpicks of different shapes or sizes.\n\nAlmost any ingredient can be put on the bread, but those most commonly found in the Basque Country include fish such as hake, cod, anchovy; tortilla de patatas; stuffed peppers; and croquettes. Pinchos can be very sophisticated, sometimes consisting of very elaborate (and sometimes expensive) fish, seafood, or meats.\n\nPinchos are used as an excuse for socializing. Typically, a group of friends will go from one tavern to another, drinking small glasses of wine or beer and eating pinchos.\n\nPinchos can also refer to \"pinchos morunos\", which consists of pieces of meat, marinated in a mix of paprika and oil called \"adobo\" and roasted on a skewer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9702245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702245", "title": "Malu", "text": "Malu\n\nMalu is a word in the Samoan language for a female-specific tattoo of cultural significance. The malu covers the legs from just below the knee to the upper thighs just below the buttocks, and is typically finer and delicate in design compared to the \"Pe'a\", the equivalent tattoo for males. The malu takes its name from a particular motif of the same name, usually tattooed in the popliteal fossa (sometimes referred to as the kneepit, or poplit) behind the knee. It is one of the key motifs not seen on men. According to Samoan scholar Albert Wendt and tattooist Su'a Suluape Paulo II, in tattooing the term ‘malu’ refers to notions of sheltering and protection. Samoan women were also tattooed on the hands and sometimes the lower abdomen. These practices have undergone a resurgence since the late 1990s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, only the district Paramount Chief's daughter was eligible to wear the malu and it was applied to these young women in the years following puberty. Women with the malu were expected to perform key ceremony tasks and represent their families and villages on ceremonial occasions. However, in 1930, anthropologist Te Rangi Hiroa observed that \"...the tattooing of a girl is often used as an opportunity for a student to try his prentice hand. This is also rendered possible by the fact that there is no fusita (fine mat) passed or any of the ceremony that marks the tattooing of the male. It is often sufficient reward for the novice to have the opportunity of practice and to be well fed during the period occupied by the operation...For the daughter of a high chief, who is to become the village taupou, it can be readily understood that an expert artist would be requisitioned and his reward greater.\" Ceremonial roles are still important in Samoan society and are restricted in similar ways to particular people with the correct qualifications and cultural knowledge, but the significance of the malu has shifted. From at least the 1990s, there has been less emphasis on chiefly qualifications, and women of a variety of backgrounds and ages have been tattooed with the malu. However, the malu is not important to all Samoans, or the only symbol of an individuals commitment or participation in Samoan cultural life. In the Samoan congregations of some churches, men and women have been discouraged from getting tattooed.' In New Zealand and Australia, the malu is increasingly important as a symbol of Samoan cultural identity rather than only a signifier of a persons ability to carry out specific Samoan ceremonial roles. The contemporary meanings and significance of malu are often vigorously contested and in recent years this has become especially noticeable in social media forums when tattooists and tattooed people share photographs of their tattoos. It is clear from these most public debates that the changes in meaning for all forms of Samoan tattooing are being made by the people who wear the images as much as the tattooists who create them.\n\nThere are also accounts of non-Samoan women receiving the malu. One relates to an American named Elsie Bach who worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Samoa in the 1970s. She developed strong relationships with families in the Samoan community, and received a malu and a matai (chiefly) title in acknowledgement.[4] As Samoan tattooists have travelled and worked in the United States and Europe, women from other ethnic backgrounds and nationalities have been tattooed with the malu or elements of it. For some Samoans this practice is controversial and is often a topic of debate in social media discussions.\n\n"}

The word caught on initially as it was short and easier to understand than other possibilities, such as \"automobile carriage\", \"motor carriage\", \"motor vehicle\", or \"auto carriage\". It is now archaic and rarely used. The term \"motor vehicle\" is currently used in legal, transportation planning and academic terminology.\n\nOne of the first publications of the word \"motocycle\" in the United States was when \"The Chicago Times-Herald\" reported on November 29, 1895, of America's first automobile race the day before \n\nIt turns out that Herman H. Kohlsaat, owner of the \"Times-Herald\", and Frederick Upham Adams, a local writer with a mechanical engineering interest, ran a public contest for someone to come up with a unique name to replace \"horseless carriage\" that represented the new motorized transport. The $500 prize for the new name went to the general manager of the New York Telephone Company for the name \"motocycle\" in 1895. He suggested the name \"motocycle\" as being as close to a correct definition as sounding good to defining exactly what it was. He is credited as the first to coin this name that would replace \"horseless carriage.\" It was used then for reports on \"The Times-Herald's\" first automobile race. The name received little public enthusiasm and by the end of the nineteenth century went into discontinuance.\n\nStarting in the twentieth century the name \"automobile\" became popular instead of motocycle in the United States and in Great Britain the motocycle became \"motorcar\" or \"autocar\".\n\nCharles Brady King intended to enter a \"horseless carriage\" in the 1895 \"Times-Herald\" race, but wrote to Adams that although he intended to enter a motocycle with four wheels and a 4-horsepower 100-pound engine, it wasn't quite ready and he would have to withdraw. His motocycle could carry four persons, but for the race there would have been only two in the vehicle to reduce the weight and gain speed. His lightweight motocycle came in at 675 pounds, could seat four people plus cargo, and would probably sell for about $600 in a large quantity production. His motocycle dream, however, did not flourish and was realized by Ford and Olds instead.\n\nIn 1898 \"Modern machinery\" magazine pointed out the merits of gasoline-, electric- and steam-propelled 4-wheeled motocycles (automobiles).\n\nThe term \"motor vehicle\" is defined in legal terms as most self-powered vehicles (i.e. automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, recreational vehicles) on public highways, no matter how many wheels it has or how many passengers it can carry or how much freight it can transport. In the United States these \"motor vehicles\" are registered with the local state Department of Motor Vehicles or Secretary of State.\n\n\n\n"}

The game is played with 28 cards: eight through ace, in all four suits. The ace can be played as a low card, as though it were a seven, or as a high card. The game uses an ante, and is usually played with a no limit structure.\n\nAll players are dealt 2 cards pre-flop and are then allowed to bet. After the flop there is another round of betting. Then one card is flipped (the turn) and there's a third round of betting before the flipping of the last card (the river) and the final round of betting. After betting is done, all players show their cards and whoever has the best hand wins the pot. In some cases the pot has to be split. The poker hand ratings are the same as Texas Hold 'em except that a flush beats a full house.\n\n"}

It is popular not only in Nepal but also in every Gorkhali or Nepalese diaspora household worldwide. The annual production of gundruk in Nepal is estimated at 2,000 tons and most of the production is carried out at the household level. Gundruk is obtained from the fermentation of leafy vegetables (\"saag\"; ). It is served as a side dish with the main meal and is also used as an appetizer. Gundruk is an important source of minerals particularly during the off-season when the diet consists of mostly starchy tubers and maize which tend to be low in minerals.\n\nIn the months of October and November, during the harvest of the first broad mustard, mustard green, radish and cauliflower leaves, large quantities of leaves accumulate — much more than can be consumed fresh. These leaves are allowed to wilt for one or two days and then shredded with a knife or sickle.\nNot only the leaves of the radish but also the roots are also used to make a better quality gundruk. The roots of radish can be mixed with the leaves and smashed together. When it is smashed, care should be taken not to make pieces too small. In mountainous regions of central part of Nepal, the smashed radish and leaves are put into an earthenwares, compressed and the mouth of container is closed tightly. It is then buried in safe and sunny place. It may be placed in an open place. After a few days, the acidity can be tasted or when it is ready, it can readily be known from its smell as well. It is then dried in sunlight. Gundruk prepared in this manner is more tasty, more flavorsome and more acidic.\n\nThe shredded leaves are tightly packed in an earthenware pot, and warm water (at about 30 °C) is added to cover all the leaves. The pot is then kept in a warm place. After a week, a mild acidic taste indicates the end of fermentation and the Gundruk is removed and dried in the sun‹›. This process is similar to sauerkraut or kimchi production except that no salt is added to the shredded leaves before the start of gundruk fermentation. The ambient temperature at the time of fermentation is about 18 °C. \"Pediococcus\" and \"Lactobacillus\" species are the predominant microorganisms active during Gundruk fermentation. During fermentation, the pH drops slowly to a final value of 4.0 and the amount of acid (as lactic) increases to about 1% on the sixth day. It has been found that a disadvantage with the traditional process of Gundruk fermentation is the loss of 90% of the carotenoids, probably during sun-drying. Improved methods of drying might reduce the vitamin loss.\n\n\n"}

Although the dish's name is derived from Huancayo, a city in the Peruvian highlands, this dish is from Lima - Perú. It has become a staple of everyday and holiday cuisine throughout the country.\n\nIt is typically served cold as a starter over lettuce leaves and garnished with black olives, white corn kernels and hard boiled egg quarters.\n\nThe sauce is made of queso fresco (fresh white cheese), vegetable oil, aji amarillo (yellow Peruvian pepper), evaporated milk and salt mixed in a blender. Some recipes call for garlic, onion and crushed saltines. This sauce is also used in many other Peruvian dishes.\n\nIn the south of Peru (Cuzco, Puno, Arequipa) it is served with ocopa rather than Huancaína sauce, made from freshly toasted peanuts, fried onions and tomatoes, aji amarillo, cream or condensed milk, crushed crackers or dried bread, salt, and huacatay (\"Tagetes minuta\").\n\nBecause it is served cold, Papa a la Huancaina is a favorite food of Peruvians to take on picnics and trips.\n\nThe origin of Papa a la Huancaina is controversial. On one side, stories exist that point to the area of Lima:\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that while the cheese and the potato are produced along the Peruvian sierra, they are also produced along the coast. In fact, the cultivating of the yellow pepper takes place only in coastal zones (4,000-year-old yellow pepper remnants have been found in the archaeological sites of Huaca Prieta and Ancon). In addition, the olives that accompany the preparation, also originate from the coast, and not the city of Huancayo. It should also be mentioned that it does not match the preparation style of typical Huancan food, which often consists of hot foods made with red meat, additionally in the cities along the Peruvian sierra it is uncommon to serve appetizers.\n"}
{"id": "9735785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9735785", "title": "Lomo saltado", "text": "Lomo saltado\n\nLomo saltado is a popular, traditional Peruvian dish, a stir fry that typically combines marinated strips of sirloin (or other beef steak) with onions, tomatoes, french fries, and other ingredients; and is typically served with rice. The dish originated as part of the chifa tradition, the Chinese cuisine of Peru, though its popularity has made it part of the mainstream culture.\n\nThe dish is normally prepared by marinating sirloin strips in vinegar, soy sauce and spices, and stir frying these with red onions, parsley, tomatoes, and possibly other ingredients. The use of both potatoes (which originated in Peru) and rice (which originated in Asia) as starches are typical of the cultural blending that the dish represents.\n\nIn his 2013 article in the \"Huffington Post UK\", British-Peruvian chef Martin Morales called lomo saltado \"one of Peru's most loved dishes\" and that this dish \"shows the rich fusion of old and new worlds. This juicy mixture of beef, onions, tomatoes, aji Amarillo paste and soy sauce sauteed in a large pan (or wok) is one of the many contributions Chinese immigration brought to Peru.\" He explains, \"Lomo Saltado is sometimes known as a Criollo dish but more known as a Peruvian-Chinese dish; a favourite Chifa dish. These are its true roots.\" \n\nAccording to a 2011 article that was published in the Peruvian newspaper \"El Comercio\", the book “Diccionario de la Gastronomía Peruana Tradicional” published in 2009 by Sergio Zapata Acha, includes an old description for lomo saltado, which fails to mention its Asian influence. Although this doesn't deny the dish's widely accepted Chinese-Peruvian roots, the article's author then ponders possible relations to similar dishes like \"lomo de vaca\" and \"lomo a la chorrillana\".\n\nThe word \"saltado\" refers to stir fry (\"salteado\" in other Spanish-speaking countries, from the french sautée, which means to \"jump\"), a widely recognized Chinese cooking technique. Hence, \"saltado\" dishes are commonly known in Peru to have a Chinese cuisine influence. The same 2011 newspaper article mentions that having a Chinese cook (or servant) was considered a luxury at the time, and that years later after completing their indenture contracts, many Chinese Peruvians opened restaurants that became known as Chifa by 1921. A census of Lima in 1613 show the presence of Chinese (and other Asians) in Peru, mainly servants (and slaves). Later, large numbers of Chinese immigrant workers arrived between 1849 and 1874, to replace African slave laborers, while Peru was in the process of abolishing slavery. So it's not a surprise that a 1903 Peruvian cookbook (\"Nuevo Manual de Cocina a la Criolla\") included a short description of \"lomo saltado\". An indication of assimilation of Chinese cooking technique in Peruvian cuisine. The culinary term \"saltado\" is unique to Peru, and didn't exist in other Latin countries of that era, nor used in any Spanish cuisine terminology. This old cookbook description of the dish is very short and doesn't mention soy sauce or other typical Asian ingredients of the dish we know today. It also doesn't mention black pepper, vinegar, or Peruvian chilies. A few critics incorrectly theorized a purely Peruvian origin (without foreign influence) based on this cookbook, which features an assorted variety of regional Peruvian dishes (from Arequipa, Chorrillos, Moquegua, etc.). But this cookbook's list of traditional Peruvian Criollo cuisine includes many dishes with Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Guatemalan and Chilean origins. The 1903 cookbook is not an all inclusive list of old Peruvian dishes available in the country, and it doesn't contradict the Chinese-Peruvian roots of \"lomo saltado\". It serves as an example (the opinions of its editor) of a variety of dishes that were commonplace in Peru of that era, regardless of origin.\n\nIn a 2014 video interview for the Peruvian newspaper \"El Comercio\", noted Peruvian chief Gastón Acurio demonstrates how he makes his version of lomo saltado.\n\n"}

The dish is served with different sauces, such as ketchup and mustard, crema de aceituna (olive sauce), along with aji or chili peppers.

They are popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Europe, New Zealand, Canada, Zimbabwe and South Africa. \n\nMeat pie is found in the Neolithic Period, around 9500 BC. The ancient Egyptians' diet featured basic pies made from oat, wheat, rye, and barley, and filled with honey and baked over hot coals.\n\nThe Greeks used a flour-water paste resembling pie pastry, and filled it with meat. These pies were usually fried or cooked under coals. The Romans adopted them, using a variety of meats, oysters, mussels, lampreys, and fish as filling and a mixture of flour, oil, and water for the crust. This 'pastry' cover was not meant to be eaten and was thrown away.\n\nIn Northern Europe, cooks created the pastry using fats like lard and butter to make stiff dough to hold an upright pie. These medieval pastry dishes were called \"coffins/coffyns\", which means a basket or box. According to Janet Clarkson in \"Pie: A Global History\", the \"coffins\" were:\n\nSome historians suggest the tough, almost inedible, crust was given to the servants while the lords and ladies of the house ate the contents.\n\nThis pastry became a common dish in medieval times, and by the 14th century, came to be called a \"pye\" or \"pie\". The etymology of the word is unknown, but may be related to the magpie (also called \"pie\"), perhaps because both were spotted, or because the bird collects miscellaneous articles.\n\nThe French and Italians specialized in redefining the pastry of the pie, making it flakier and tastier by new methods of adding butter, rolling, and folding the dough. In 1440, the Paris pastry guild was recognized and started to expand their product—and so something like the modern day crust began to be used.\n\nMissionaries and explorers spread the meat-based pie dish across the globe. The English Pilgrims of the North American colonies brought the recipes across the ocean with them. The crust of the pie was useful to preserve food during the long winter months in America (just as the pies were used in antiquity). But the pie was not considered popular there until the 1800s, and today meat pies have lost their popularity to be replaced with sweet pies.\n\nThe Natchitoches meat pie is one of the official state foods of the US state of Louisiana..\n\nLatin American meat empanadas may be pies or more often pasties; different pastry shells and fillings are used, and they may be baked or fried. Empanadas usually contain lots of onion and green or red pepper, in combination with meat or fish. Empanada dough takes many forms, from those made with cornmeal to puff pastry. Ground beef with olives, fried egg, pulled pork, diced steak, even cheese and salami are used in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico and Peru for example.\n\nOther well known varieties of meat pie include British meat pies, French-Canadian meat pie, and the Australia and NZ meat pie. An Irish meat pie is the steak and Guinness pie which consists of round steak with Guinness Stout Beer, bacon, and onions. It is served with potato chips and vegetables and is very popular in Irish pubs in Australia. In both Australia and New Zealand, the meat pie is a common convenience food often found in petrol stations and convenience stores and in New Zealand was once sold in a chain of fast-food restaurants.\n\nThe Nigerian \"meat pie\" is similar to the Jamaican beef patty. It can be baked or fried, and the filling can be almost anything from corned beef (the most widely used) to just onions and tomatoes.\n\nMiddle Eastern meat pies are called sfiha and contain ground beef, olive oil, plain yogurt, tahini, allspice, onion, tomatoes and pine nuts. Greek meat pies are called kreatopita and contain ground beef, onions and feta cheese. The filling for kreatopita is wrapped in phyllo dough. Indian meat pies are called samosa and usually contain peas, spiced potatoes, coriander, lentils, or ground beef or chicken and are often served with chutney.\n\nPies, History of Pies.\" What's Cooking America History of Pies .

While typically made from rice, varieties made out of other food grains like wheat, ragi, etc. can also be found. Sevai is popular throughout South India as a meal throughout the day.\n\nSevai is mostly made fresh starting from rice grains. It is also prepared from a dried sevai packs (or rice sticks) like the instant ones in the Asian grocery stores. Traditionally, making of sevai at home consists of the following steps (with minor variations based on location and family customs):\n\nHomemade sevai is often made from 100% rice (in addition to water and salt) whereas dry rice sticks may often have some additives like tapioca, corn starch, etc. Instant rice noodles have other additives like Wheat gluten, Guar gum, edible starch, etc. In Southern parts of Karnataka, shyaavige is made of different grains with different consistencies. When made with ragi or millet the vermicelli is fatter, whereas when made with rice or wheat the strands are thinner.\n\nSevai is similar to \"idiyappam,\" in the ingredients and preparation. Sevai, unlike idiyappam, is typically broken or cut up rather than in piles of noodles. In this way, sevai is treated almost as a substitute for rice. Idiyappam, by contrast, is served almost as a substitute for \"appam\" with side dishes like curries or kormas.The press used to make sevai and idiyappam are essentially the same. Sevai is also typically not served with curries other side dishes, but rather mixed with a flavoring like lemon, tamarind paste, coconut, or \"uddina pudi\" (a type of powder made from black gram dal in Karnataka). Called \"shavige\" in Karnataka, it can also be prepared with cooked vegetables and tempered with spices with a dash of lemon juice.\n\nSevai is typically served in Tamil Nadu and other South Indian communities as a breakfast or tiffin dish, but also served as a dessert such as \"payasam\" when cooked in milk with cardamom or other spices and sugar. In the Malnad region of Karnataka, it may be served with chicken curry, rather unlike how it is usually served in other parts of South India. Sankethi communities also differ from the norm in that they prepare idiyappam and serve it like sevai, flavored with lemon, tamarind, or \"uddina\" pudi.

Once strictly a ceremonial art derived from \"kami'gakari\" (神懸, かみがかり, \"oracular divinaification\"), Kagura has evolved in many directions over the span of more than a millennium. Today it is very much a living tradition, with rituals tied to the rhythms of the agricultural calendar, as well as vibrant Kabuki-esque theatre, thriving primarily in parts of Shimane prefecture, and urban centers such as Hiroshima.\n\nThe epics \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\" describe a folklore origin for the dances. In these texts, there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu, who retreated into a cave, bringing darkness and cold to the world. Ame-no-Uzume, \"kami\"/goddess of the dawn and of revelry, led the other gods in a wild dance, and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about. \"Kagura\" is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event.\n\nOriginally called \"kamukura\" or \"kamikura\" (神座), \"kagura\" began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens (\"miko\") who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume. Over time, however, these \"mikagura\" (御神楽), performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts, inspired popular ritual dances, called \"satokagura\" (里神楽), which, being popular forms, practiced in villages all around the country, were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms. Among these are \"miko kagura\", \"shishi kagura\", and Ise-style and Izumo-style \"kagura\" dances. Many more variations have developed over the centuries, including some which are fairly new, and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions.\n\n\"Kagura\", in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables, is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre.\n\nThe formal ritual dances (\"mikagura\") were performed in a number of sacred places and on a number of special occasions. At the Imperial Sanctuary, where the Sacred Mirror was kept, they were performed as part of \"gagaku\" court music. \"Mikagura\" were also performed at the Imperial harvest festival and at major shrines such as Ise, Kamo, and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū. Since around the year 1000, these events have taken place every year.\n\nAccording to the ritual department of the Imperial Household Agency, \"kagura\" still take place every December in the Imperial Sanctuary and at the Imperial harvest festival ceremonies.\n\n\"Satokagura\", or \"normal kagura\", is a wide umbrella term containing a great diversity of folk dances derived from \"mikagura\", and incorporated with other folk traditions. For the sake of brevity, a selection of traditions from the Kantō region will be used as examples.\n\n\nAround the time of the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), performances derived from this emerged in Edo as a major form of entertainment.

Equivalently it is the surface formed by the centers of the circles which osculate the curvature lines.\n\nAs the principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the focal surface on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the focal surface are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the focal surface has a cuspidal edge, three such edges pass through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is zero, one sheet of the focal surface will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature.\n\nThe sphere is the only surface where both sheets of the focal surface degenerate to a single point.\n\nBoth sheets of the focal surface of a Dupin cyclide degenerate to curves. These curves form a pair of anticonics, i.e., an ellipse and a hyperbola in perpendicular planes, each passing through the respective foci of the other curve. For the torus, a special Dupin cyclide, the focal ellipse becomes a circle and the focal hyperbola degenerates to the axis of the circle.\n\nOne sheet of the focal surface of a channel surface will form a degenerate curve. Such surfaces includes all surfaces of revolution, where the degenerate curve is the axis of revolution.\n\n"}
{"id": "9802606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9802606", "title": "Bradley-Martin Ball", "text": "Bradley-Martin Ball\n\nThe Bradley-Martin Ball was a lavish costume ball at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City on the night of February 10, 1897. Cornelia Bradley-Martin, wife of Bradley Martin, organized the ball, with the intention of making it \"the greatest party in the history of the city\". Eight hundred socialites spent about $400,000 imitating kings and queens. Bradley-Martin's stated intention was to create an economic stimulus for New York City, which was at the end of the Long Depression which began in 1873 and included the Panic of 1893. The Bradley-Martins spent approximately $9.7 million in today's money to throw the ball. Across the country, preachers and editorial writers argued over the propriety of a party that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the end, the ball was a social triumph but created negative publicity.\n\nAlthough the Bradley-Martin's stated intention was to benefit New York city through an economic stimulus, Bradley Martin's wife, Cornelia Bradley Martin, had other intentions as well. Cornelia Bradley Martin wished to arrange a costume ball that would surpass every other ball in history. She specifically wished to throw a greater ball than that of Alva Vanderbilt's famous ball of 1883, which was previously to be the greatest party in the history of the city. For weeks, Cornelia would have her secretary make sure that the papers had all the important details and would be widespread through the city. Before long, the public began to backlash. \n\nIn the three weeks leading up to it, New York society made the ball its one topic of discussion. The \"Commercial Advertiser\" exclaimed: \"There is a great stir today in fashionable circles and even in public circles. The cause of it all is the Bradley Martin ball, beside which the arbitration treaty, the Cuban question, and the Lexow investigation seem to have become secondary matters of public interest.\"\n\nThe guests included: Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, known simply as Mrs. Astor, costumed as Mary, Queen of Scots, her son John Jacob Astor as Henry IV of France and his wife as Marie Antoinette, James L. Breese as the Duke of Guise, John Pierpont Morgan, Charles Childs as Lady Teazle, Hermann Oelrichs as a Dutch Bergomaster, Charles Post as Madame de Maintenon, Stanford White in a Court costume of black velvet and white satin, the artist Adolfo Müller-Ury as a Spanish toreador, Pierpont Morgan as Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Hamilton Fish Webster as Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nCornelia Bradley-Martin’s idea was to give a costume ball at so short notice that her guests would not have time to get their dresses from Paris, and instead support local businesses. This overlapped with the idea that it was much better for the laboring people if the wealthy spent their money locally instead of taking it to Europe.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Rainsford believed in the rich giving money to be distributed as charity, whereas others, including the members of the Musical Mutual Protective Union (MMPU), disagreed. They believed in the wealthy spending their wealth in enjoying themselves, and thus giving hundreds and thousands of working people an opportunity to earn money and maintain their self-respect instead of having to accept charity. The MMPU became indignant when they heard that the Marine Band was to be at the ball instead of musicians from their union. The members of the Marine Band did not urgently need the money that they were going to receive from the ball.\n\nFlorist Small was in charge of the decorations for the Bradley-Martin ball. Decorating the Waldorf began on the morning of February 9 by A.W. Merritt, Small’s colleague. In the days leading up to the event, dealers’ stocks and household stores were ransacked to supply the demand for ornaments and historical accuracy. All the jewelers who dealt in antiques were cleaned out of all they had on hand. Jewels held as heirlooms by the old families of New York were taken from safety vaults. Laces that had been locked away in family chests or in safe deposit vaults for long years had been retrieved.\n\nTwelve hundred invitations were issued for the event, and more than half of those invited were in attendance. Some who did come also left early, seeming to have made an appearance out of curiosity.\n\n\"The interior of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was transformed into a replica of Versailles, and rare tapestries, beautiful flowers and countless lights made an effective background for the wonderful gowns and their wearers.\"\n\nPolice officers stood guard at the entrance to the Waldorf. The Bradley-Martins arrived first at 10:15 pm. At half past 10 a group of carriages arrived and before 11 the stream of guests had become continuous. The guests were ushered into the Waldorf, whereupon they ascended to the corridors on the second floor where 15 dressing rooms were available for the use and comfort of the guests. Some guests, preferring not to expose themselves on the street while wearing tempting fortunes in jewels and laces, changed into their costumes at this point. This wasn’t done through any feeling of fear, but merely as a wise precaution. Wigmakers and make-up artists were available in these rooms. When leaving the dressing rooms the guests headed to the smaller ballroom. It was here where Cornelia Bradley-Martin received her guests. A lackey announced the guests’ names and the characters they impersonated to her. This stream of guests poured by her for nearly 90 minutes and it was after midnight before she was able to enter the main ballroom to take her place in the opening \"quadrille d’honneur\".\n\nCornelia Bradley-Martin requested her guests to pick something from the 16th, 17th, or 18th centuries, and some came dressed as George Washington, a Japanese nobleman, an Egyptian princess and Pocahontas. A list was compiled and published in the \"New York Times\" three days prior to the event, listing guests and the historical characters they were going to impersonate and what costumes they were going to wear. Bradley-Martin \"personated Mary Stuart, and her gold embroidered gown was trimmed with pearls and precious stones worth more than $60,000. Bradley (Martin), as Louis XV, wore a Court suit of brocade\". \"In many cases the diamond buttons worn by the men represented thousands of dollars, and the value of the historic gems worn by the ladies baffles description.\" At the time, the average income of an American was $400 a year.\n\nOtho Cushing, a young artist from Boston, created quite a stir when he appeared as an Italian falconer's costume which consisted of full body tights, a short jacket and a cap with a stuffed falcon on one arm. \"The costume left little to the imagination as far as the figure was concerned, and, although historically correct in every detail, was so decidedly pronounced that he made a sensation wherever he moved.\"\n\nThe smaller ballroom was set throughout with furniture of the Louis XV period, and the walls were hung with tapestry draperies. Roses were hurled en masse against the draperies and let remain where they landed. The side of the room, where the Hungarian band was placed, was concealed by long-stemmed roses and garlands were dropped from the center to each side and over the mirrors. The Hungarian Band, under the leadership of Carl Berlinger, played 12 concert selections, chosen by Mrs. Bradley-Martin, throughout the evening.\n\nUpon entering the grand ballroom the guests faced a wall in which 15 mirrors were imbedded. The far side of the room, the musicians’ balcony, was concealed by pink roses, with garlands also hanging from above. There were over 5,000 roses and 3,000 orchids in these various groupings.\n\nThe café and the court were also decorated, with a desired homelike effect. 125 tables were set up, each to accommodate six guests, with a centerpiece of Beauty roses.\n\nThe \"danse d’honneur\", arranged by Caroline Astor, opened the ball. The company was led by Cornelia Bradley-Martin, in the role of the Queen, escorted by John Jacob Astor as the King. For this danse d’honneur, the orchestra played music composed by Beethoven. Following this, the orchestra started playing one of Chopin’s polonaises announcing the approach of the wife of Edmund L. Baylies and her associates for the minuet. When they formed for the minuet the orchestra struck into Mozart’s dance music out of \"Don Giovanni\". The dance of the debutantes was next, and it was livelier than the others and the most difficult of all. The members of this set, organized by the wife of Frederic Bronson, danced a Hungarian Court quadrille, the Kormagyar, in music arranged by Allen Dodworth. This quadrille ended the exhibition dances. General dancing followed the three quadrilles until supper time.\n\n\"Between the grand ballroom and the cafe, used on this occasion for the supper room, is a barricade of windows, which were thrown open about 1 o'clock in the morning, and the guests were then at liberty to enjoy the delights of the cuisine. The menu was as follows:\n\nThe cotillion commenced at three, and spectators found amusement as the gentlemen danced it with swords at their sides. Swords got tangled in gowns and laces, and courtiers tripped over them, to the delight of the spectators. Elisha Dyer, Jr. led the cotillion.\n\nCornelia Bradley-Martin selected small silver figures and a staff as “favors” for each of the guests of the ball. The “favors” were awarded by Elisha Dyer, Jr. as leader of the cotillion.\n\nBefore the Ball took place, the Bradley-Martins drew fire from all directions, as newspapers criticized its extravagance and clergymen urged their congregations not to attend. One clergyman denounced the ball by saying: \"You rich people put next to nothing in the collection plate, and yet you’ll spend thousands of dollars on Mrs. Bradley-Martin’s ball”.\n\nAfter the ball many ministers preached against its excessive consumption and the authorities promptly raised Bradley-Martin’s taxes (as well as those of their friends and fellow-attendees the Astors) quite out of proportion to those paid by anyone else. The Bradley-Martins returned to England, where they had owned a home for several years, and Scotland, where they leased a estate, Balmacaan.\n\nAlthough historians have repeated oft-told half-truths without conducting primary research, the Bradley-Martin ball is perhaps best-remembered as the end of the excesses of the Gilded Age.\n\n\n"}

The cells flock together, forming a mass that behaves as an organised, slug-like unit. Before they get stimulated to crowd together to form a grex, the amoebae simply wander as independent cells grazing on bacteria and other suitable food items. They continue in that way of life as long as conditions are favourable. When the amoebae are stressed, typically by a shortage of food, they form a grex.\nAccording to species and circumstances, details of the shape of the grex and how it may form will vary but typically the stressed amoebae first produce pheromones that stimulate the flock to assemble in a vertical column. When the column of aggregated cells becomes too high and narrow to stay upright, it topples and becomes a slug-shaped mass: the grex. The grex is mobile; in its form as a slug-like unit it can glide over a moist surface. Once it has moved far enough to complete its development, the cells of the amoebae differentiate according to their positions in the grex; some become the spore cells and the covering shell of the \"fruiting body\" near the tip, and others form structures such as the stalk. Cells forming the structural items, such as the stalk and shell, desiccate and die; only the spores in the fruiting body survive to propagate. When circumstances are right and the fruiting body is mature, its shell ruptures and releases the spores. The spores then may be transported by media such as wind or water; they then may cover distances far greater than any that they could have achieved in their amoeboid form, and over regions where amoebae could not travel at all, such as dry surfaces.\n\n\nZimmer, C. 1998.

It is a variation of traditional Italian \"scaloppina\" dishes, of which there are many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.\n\nIn an alternative method, the chicken breasts may be braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices.\n\n"}

The drink is named after \"pajaro macuá\", a tropical bird native to the country.\n\nThe Macuá was invented by Dr Edmundo Miranda Saenz, a pediatrician from Granada, a small and historic city on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. Miranda enlisted the help of his immediate family, including his wife, daughter and son-in-law, to perfect the recipe.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Tour Operator Solentiname Tours and the Association of Restaurants in Nicaragua recognized a need for a national drink. Both invited hotel and restaurant owners across Nicaragua to come together and enlisted the help of CEM-JWT Communications, a Nicaraguan advertising agency, to turn the idea into a reality.\n\nThe drink rose to fame in October 2006, when it was entered in a competition to choose a national drink of Nicaragua. The competition, sponsored by Flor de Caña, a Nicaraguan rum manufacturer, involved more than twenty different drinks based on the company's products. The judges, including the French ambassador and a cocktail connoisseur from a Swedish development agency, chose the Macuá over other combinations of local ingredients including pineapple, tamarind and even coffee beans. More adventurous entrants made use of some of Nicaragua's most obscure flora such as the mamoncillo, the extract of which is used as a local cure for stomachache.\n\nThis drink was created for a contest looking to creating a symbol that inspires national identity, such as Lake Cocibolca and the archaeological sites in Isla Zapatera, Ometepe and Solentiname, which make the lake a unique destination in the world.\n\nThe Contest, called \"The Nacional Drink Contest\", (\"El Trago Nacional\"), was sponsored by Flor de Caña, Hotel Intercontinental, Solentiname Tours, Morgan's Rock, Canatur, INTUR, and Radio Tigre. The presence of the INTUR (National Tourism Institute) validated the contest as an \"official\" selection, even if organized by private investors, not the government.\n\nThe contest was divided in two parts: the selection of the recipe, and the selection of the name.\n\nHowever, El Nuevo Diario criticized the theme of the contest for selecting only a few regions of the country for defining the national identity (Lake Cocibolca and Granada), and that the selected winning recipe for the contest required to contain a minimum of 50% Flor de Caña rum, the sponsoring liquor company.\n\n"}

A food may be labeled \"plus\" to describe its nutrients only if it contains at least 10% more of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily Reference Value compared to the usual amount. Because Diet Coke Plus labeling does not indicate the increased amount of nutrients, it cannot use the word \"plus\" on its label.

{"id": "10058120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10058120", "title": "Akhara", "text": "Akhara\n\nAkhara or Akhada (Sanskrit and Hindi: अखाड़ा, shortened to \"khara\" Hindi: खाड़ा) is an Indian word for a place of practice with facilities for boarding, lodging and training, both in the context of Indian martial artists or a \"sampradaya\" monastery for religious renunciates in Guru–shishya tradition. For example, in the context of the Dashanami Sampradaya sect, the word denotes both martial arts and religious monastic aspects of the trident wielding martial regiment of renunciate sadhus. In Chota Nagpur plateau region, Akhara or Akhra is village ground where villagers dance during harvest season and various feastvals.\n\nThe term \"akhara\", is a gender egalitarian term, which means the \"circle\" or more precisely \"the spiritual core\", \"congregation\" or \"league\", it is similar to the Greek-origin word \"academy\" and the English word \"school\", can be used to mean both a physical institution or a group of them which share a common lineage or are under a single leadership, such as the school of monastic thought or the school of martial arts. Unlike the gurukul in which students live and study at the home of a guru, members of an akhara although train under a guru but they do not live a domestic or homely life. Some strictly practice Brahmacharya (celibacy) and others may require complete renunciation of worldly life. For example, wrestlers are expected to live a pure life while living at akahara with other fellow wrestlers, refraining from sex and owning few material possessions.\n\nIn some languages such as Odia the word is officially transcribed as \"akhada\", by way of rendering the flapped sound as a \"d\". The Haryanvi and Khari Boli dialects shorten this to \"khada\" (खाड़ा).\n\nIn its earliest usage, \"akhara\" referred to training halls for professional fighters. Govind Sadashiv Ghurye translates the term as \"military regiment\". Ancient use of the word can be found in the \"Mahabharata\" (c. 400 BCE text describing 900 BCE era) epic which mentions Jarasandha's Akhara at Rajgir. Legendary figures like Parashurama and Agastya are credited as the founders of the early martial akhara in certain regions of India. \n\nSvinth (2002) traces press ups and squats used by South Asian wrestlers to the pre-classical era. Many of the popular sports mentioned in the Vedas and the epics have their origins in military training, such as boxing (\"musti-yuddha\"), wrestling (\"maladwandwa\"), chariot-racing (\"rathachalan\"), horse-riding (\"aswa-rohana\") and archery (\"dhanurvidya\"). \n\nWhen the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya (788-820 CE) founded the Dashanami Sampradaya, he divided the ascetics into two categories: Shastradhari (Sanskrit: शास्त्रधारी, lit. scripture-bearers) intelligentsia and Astradhari (Sanskrit: अस्त्रधारी, lit. weapon-bearers) warriors. Shankaracharya established Naga sadhus as an astradhari armed order. He also popularised the Char Dhams during the rein of Katyuri dynasty of Garhwal Kingdom.\n\nIn 904 CE and 1146 CE, Niranjani Akhara and Juna Akhara were founded respectively. \n\nIn 1398, Islamic fanatic Timur massacred thousands of Sadhus of various Akharas and Hindus at Haridwar mela after sacking Delhi to punish the Tughlaq Dynasty's Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq's perceived lack of brutality towards Hindus. \n\nIn 1690 CE and 1760 CE, Akharas of Saivites and Vaishnava sects fought each other at Nashik mela (60,000 died) and Haridwar mela (1,800 died). \n\nIn 1780, British company raj establish the sequence of order of procession for royal bathing by the akharas at Kumbh Mela to eliminate disputes.\n\nToday, akhara may be used for religious purposes or for the teaching of yoga and martial arts. Some of the noted Akhara organizations include, Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (All India Akhara Council), Nirmohi Akhara, Shri Dattatreya Akhara and Guru Hanuman Akhara.\n\nSampradaya is a particular system of belief and within it a particular guru's lineage is called \"parampara\". There are 3 distinct belief-system Sampradayas (Vaishnava, Shaivite and Dashanami sampradaya), each of which follows one of 3 types of Guru–shishya parampara lineage (Deva, Rishi and Manav parampara), each sampradaya-parampara may have several akharas of shastradhari (intellectuals) or astradhari (warriors), and larger akharas may have own one or more permanent mathas.\n\nSampradaya (Sanskrit : सम्प्रदाय IAST \"\") translated as ‘tradition’, 'spiritual lineage' or a ‘religious system’. It relates to a succession of masters and disciples, which serves as a spiritual channel, and provides a delicate network of relationships that lends stability to a religious identity. \"Sampradaya\" is a body of practice, views and attitudes, which are transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. A particular guru lineage is called \"parampara\". By receiving diksha (initiation) into the \"guru–shishya traditional\" \"parampara\" of a living guru, one belongs to its proper \"sampradaya\". One cannot become a member by birth, as is the case with \"gotra\", a seminal, or hereditary, dynasty. In the traditional residential form of education, the shishya remains with his or her guru as a family member and gets the education as a true learner. In some traditions there is never more than one active master at the same time in the same \"guruparamaparya\" (lineage).\n\nWhen the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya founded the Dashanami Sampradaya, he divided the ascetics into two categories: \n\nAstra (HIndi: अस्त्र), the weapons or martial arts have a long tradition in India. The oldest recorded organized unarmed fighting art in South Asia is malla-yuddha or combat-wrestling, codified into four forms and pre-dating the Vedic Period. Stories describing Krishna report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds. Based on such accounts, Svinth (2002) traces press ups and squats used by South Asian wrestlers to the pre-classical era.\n\nIn modern usage, \"akhara\" most often denotes a wrestling ground and is typically associated with kushti. For wrestlers, the akhara serves as a training school and an arena in which to compete against each other. The akhara used by wrestlers still have dirt floors to which water, red ochre, buttermilk and oil are added. Aside from wrestling, other fighting systems are also taught and practiced in akhara, which are commonly named after their founder. Indian martial artists may still practice in regional versions of traditional akhara today, but these are often replaced with modern training studios outside India.\n\nWhile akhara is a place where practicing martial artists lodge and train under a martial art guru, akhara is also usually an arena for the \"dangal\" organised among the competing sports person. While living at akhara, pehlwan practice celibacy, stay smoke free and alcohol free and they eat nutrition tradition diet usually rich in milk, ghee, dried nuts and roti. \"Dangal\" is originally a Punjabi language word which means \"Sparring or competition in akhara\". Sparring is a form of training common to many combat sports which may vary in its precise form varies, but it is relatively 'free-form' fighting, with enough rules, customs, or agreements to make injuries unlikely. \n\nDangal (film) () is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical sports drama film, directed by Nitesh Tiwari and produced by Aamir Khan, loosely based on the Phogat family, telling the story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, an amateur wrestler, who trains his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become India's first world-class female wrestlers.\n\nLangot (लंगोट) or langota (लंगोटा), also Kaupinam (कौपिनम) or kaupina (कौपिन), is a traditional style of Indian loincloth for men, worn as underwear in dangal held in akharas. It is now mainly used by men when exercising and other intense physical games especially wrestling, to prevent hernias and hydrocele. \n\nLangota, mostly worn by wrestlers, is a sewn undergarment which covers the buttocks and groin. A kaupina, mostly worn by ascetics or by older men in poorer parts of India, is a similar but unsewn garment which does not covers the buttocks and instead it passes between the buttocks.\n\nThe major traditional Indian-origin martial arts akhara, mostly focused on wrestling and Pehlwani, by state include:\n\n\"Shastra\" (Sanskrit and Hindi: शास्त्र) means treatise, scriptures or the school of thoughts based on those. There has been a long monastic tradition of obtaining \"Shashtra Vidhya\" (knowledge of sashtras) in various Sampradaya schools of thoughts in Hinduism, where disciples could learn one or more of the following in a monastic setting: Hindu scriptures, Yoga Sashtra, Vastu shastra (architecture), Vaimānika Shāstra (ancient aerospace technology), Jyotiḥśāstra (astrology), Nadi sashtra (fortune telling), Rasa shastra (medicine), Shilpa Shastras (arts and craft), Natya Shastra (dance, drama and performing arts), Tantra, Para Vidya (Higher scholar), Madhu-vidya (knolwedge of bliss), and so on.\n\nAccording to some texts, an akhara is governed by the sacred body of five \"Sri Pancha\" and divided into 8 \"dava\" (divisions) and 52 Matha (Sanskrit: मठ) or \"Marhi\" (Hindi: मढ़ी). The maths are permanent centres of monastic practice with physical structures, led by a \"mahant\" or spiritual leader. Though not all akharas follow this structure, mainly due to the insufficient size. For example, smaller akhara, some as small as having only one marhi, may be set up either as a subsidiary affiliate to a larger and more established older akhara group or occasionally an independent akhara due to the disagreements over succession. Akharas can march as subsidiary akhara under the current preferential order of sequence in the \"Shahi Snan\" during \"Kumbh Mela\" or they are given the last place if their claim for the independent akhara is approved by the authorities. \n\nAccording to the texts, the top administrative body of each of the akhara is the \"Sri Pancha\" (sacred body of five), representing Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and Ganesha. It is elected by consensus from among the Mahants of Matha or \"Marhi\" (Sanskrit: मठ and Hindi: \"मढ़ी \") that make up an akhara on every Kumbha Mela and the body holds its post for 4 years. It is a concept similar to centuries old Indian republican consensual elective system of Panchayat (at an individual village level) and Khap (grouping of the related villages within a union).\n\nAmong the five elected \"Sri Pancha\" of the akhara, they hold the following positions in the decreasing order of seniority, all of which can be considered guru in their own right:\n\n\nAt highest level, \"akhara\" are classified into one of the four different Sampradaya (philosophical denominations) based on their traditional systems: Each sampradaya has several paramparas (lineages), each started by a guru based on the guru-shishya tradition. The subsidiary status is as per the traditional \"Shahi Snan\" preferential sequence of procession, though time to time several subsidiary akharas have unsuccessfully tried with authorities to have this sequence altered as the number of their followers grew.\n\nInitially there were only 4 akharas based on the sampradaya (sect), which have split into subsidiary akharas due to differences in the leadership and expansion in the followership. In january 2019, there were 13 akharas that are allowed to participate in Prayagraj Kumbh Mela and they have formed the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad with 2 representative from each of the 13 akharas to manage the akhara related affairs across all kumb melas and across the nations.\n\n\nThe still-extant seven Shastradhari or monastic Hindu akhara founded by the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya (also the founder of four Mathas) can be classified, in terms of affiliation and the number of followers, as three major akharas, three minor akharas under major akharas and one smaller akhara under the major akhara: \nThe akhara with the most sadhu is \"Juna Akhara\", followed by \"Niranjani Akhara\" and \"Mahanirvani Akhara\". Among these, today, three are considered major akhara (Juna, Niranjani and Mahanirvani) and three minor akhara (Avahan affiliated with Juna, Ananda affiliated with Niranjani and Atal affiliated with Mahanirvani). The 7th, small Brahmachari (celibate) akhara named Agni is also affiliated with Juna Akhara.\n\nThere are numerous other still-extant akharas, founded by the disciples of the existing akharas, that are usually loosely or directly aligned under one of the existing akhara lineage. The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) (Hindi: अखिल भारतीय अखाड़ा परिषद, transliterated as All India Akhara Council), founded in 1954, is the apex organisation of 13 akharas of Hindu Sants (saints) and Sadhus (ascetics) representing the largest followership in India. These are entitled to the special privilege of the \"Shahi Snan\" at Kumbh Mela and Ujjain Simhastha mela in a pre-determined sequence.\n\nThe monastic akhara and their Sri Pancha of various sects meet during the Kumbha Mela. The Naga sadhu and the various akhara traditionally lead and initiate the bathing rituals before the general population steps in.\n\nThe order of procession is 1. Mahanirvani akhara with Atal akhara, 2. Niranjani akhara with Anand akhara, 3. Juna akhara with Ahvahan and Agni akhara, 4. Nirvani akhara, 5. Digambar akhara, 6. Normohi akhara, 7. Naya Udasin akhara, 8. Bada Udasin akhara and 9.

Murray remarked that Redbreast 21 was \"Amongst the world’s truly great whiskies and near blue print for the perfect pot still Irish Whiskey\".\n\nAs of 2018, there are five variants available: Redbreast 12 Year Old, Redbreast 12 Cask Strength, Redbreast 15 Year Old, Redbreast 21 Year Old, and Redbreast Lustau Edition (matured for its final year in Bodegas Lustau sherry casks).\n\nW&A Gilbey was founded in London in 1857. By 1861, the company had opened a branch on what is now O'Connell Street in Dublin. At the time, it was customary for distilleries to sell distillate to wine merchants or \"bonders\", who had ample supplies of casks through the importation of fortified wines and would mature the whiskey themselves under bond. By the 1870s, Gilbey's – described as a \"wine importer and distiller\" at the time – had more than 300,000 gallons of whiskey from Dublin distilleries in stock under bond and sold whiskey to consumers under its own labels. These whiskeys were aged at least six years in Gilbey's own sherry casks at its bonded warehouses on Dublin's Harcourt Street.\n\nBy 1903, a whiskey known as John Jameson & Sons Castle \"JJ Liqueur\" Whiskey 12 Year Old was marketed in a bottle of similar shape and markings to those used for subsequent bottlings of Redbreast. This whiskey was produced using distillate sourced from the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin, the home of Jameson whiskey. Although this whiskey was likely the forerunner of Redbreast, the first official mention of \"Redbreast\" only dates back to 1912, when Gilbey's referred to the sale of \"Redbreast\" J.J. Liqueur Whiskey 12 Year Old. \"Redbreast\" was a nickname given to one of the whiskeys by Gilbey's chairman at the time, who was an avid birdwatcher, in reference to Robin Redbreast.\n\nIn 1968, Irish Distillers opted to phase out the supply of bonded whiskey to merchants such as Gilbey's. This threatened the future of the whiskey brand, as Irish Distillers controlled all the whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland at that point. However, following pleas from Gilbey's, Irish Distillers agreed to continue to supply distillate for the production of Redbreast.\n\nIn 1971, Irish Distillers closed all its Dublin distilleries (including Bow Street) and consolidated production at the New Midleton Distillery, a purpose-built facility in County Cork. As a result, production of Redbreast whiskey moved from Dublin to Cork.\n\nIn 1985, Gilbey's ceased production of Redbreast. It entered into an agreement to sell the brand to Irish Distillers in 1986, and the brand was subsequently relaunched in 1991 after several years of absence from the market. Initially launched as a standalone 12 year old, Redbreast has since been released in 15 year old, 21 year old, and other variants.\n\nInitially relaunched in 1991 as a 12 year old, several variants have been marketed in recent years, including:\n\nLimited editions that are no longer in production but potentially still available through specialist retailers (as of 2016) include:\n\nThe Redbreast whiskey variations have won several wards in recent years. Notably, Jim Murray, the well-known whiskey writer and author of the \"Whisky Bible\" has rated several variations of Redbreast highly, for instance:\n\n\nIn addition, Redbreast 12 Year Old and Redbreast Mano a Lámh were both rated as top-ten whiskey buys in John Hansell's Buyer's Guide.\n\nRedbreast is one of a handful of single pot still whiskeys in existence today and one of only two to have been produced almost continuously since the early 1900s (the other being Green Spot). Although once the most popular style of whiskey consumed in the world, pot still whiskey fell out of favor in the 20th century, due in part to the rise of cheaper, less intense blended whiskeys. As a result of falling demand, most Irish whiskeys were either reformulated as blends or discontinued.\n\nSingle pot still whiskeys, which are historically unique to Ireland, are similar to single malts in that they are produced solely from pot still distillate. However, in contrast to malts which only use malted barley in the mash, single pot still whiskeys are produced from a mixed mash that contains both malted and unmalted barley.\n\n\n"}

It was often worn under armour. It was derived from the simple leather jerkins worn by huntsmen and soldiers during the Tudor period, these in turn deriving from the arming doublet worn under full plate armour.\n\nBuff coats were made in sleeveless and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or buffalo hide. The very finest buff coats were made of the hide of the European elk. Buff leather was produced by a method of \"oil tanning\"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called \"kicking\" and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be repeated. The finished leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and weather resistant. \n\nDue to the thickness of the leather, the seams of these coats were all butt-jointed, with hidden or partially hidden stitches. Extant examples are lined, either with coarse linen or silk. Many high quality examples show apparent fastenings of gold or silver tape at the front, however, these were merely decorative, the real fastenings being hidden hooks and eyes attached to the inside of the join. The extant collection of buff coats preserved at Littlecote House dating to 1649-1660, contains examples with leather varying from 0.06 to 0.22 inches (1.5 to 5.5 millimeters) in thickness and entire coats weighing between 4lb 4oz and 7lb 8oz (1.9 to 3.4 kilograms).\n\nAll buff coats had deep skirts attached, which protected the upper legs of the wearer. Most surviving examples have sleeves, but a minority are sleeveless. Sleeves could be of a single thickness of leather from shoulder to wrist, or alternatively of a double thickness from the shoulder to the elbow, with a single thickness, to allow freedom of movement, to the wrist. Some of the highest quality buff coats, typically shown in portraits of officers, had multiple stripes of gold or silver lace running lengthwise down, or hooped around, the sleeves. \n\nThe coat provided some protection against cuts by swords and other edged weapons; however the buff coat was ineffective against the thrust; it was also ineffective as a protection from firearms, possibly excepting spent bullets. The buff coat was often worn under the plate armour cuirass, where it helped to cushion the wearer from chafing or bruising by the armour's edges. It was also worn on its own, as the buff coat was much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time than the cuirass. The finest quality buff coats were expensive, often much more so than the munition armour cuirasses typically issued to common soldiers, which may account for their widespread association with officers and other men of greater than average wealth.\n\nTogether with the lobster-tailed pot helmet and cuirass it formed the basis of the equipment of the harquebusier, the typical type of cavalryman of the English Civil War and other European conflicts of the 17th century. Buff coats were issued to a minority of musketeers in the pike and shot formations to give them some protection during hand-to-hand combat. The buff coat was also worn by civilians requiring a protective and durable garment, such as huntsmen and men travelling on horseback.\n\n"}

The drum is used in many music genres of Haiti and has been influential in the rest of the Caribbean and Latin American world.\n\n\"Tanbou\" is devired from the French word \"tambour\", which means drum.\n\nThe lineage of this Haitian drum is complex, originating in West African Vodun systems. A tanbou needs to be crafted properly in order to get the best sound. The drum is no longer used in Nigeria, but the \"banda rhythm\" that has been kept alive by Haitian drummers, such as \"Bonga\" (Gaston Jean-Baptiste).\n\nA tanbou produces an organic, versatile sound that can be used for dance, professional recording, and supposedly healing and merry making. The drum has survived centuries and some of the oldest are from old temples in Haiti. The older the drum, the better the sound according to the drummers.\n\nThe tambou is made with a stick like a vessel; a hardwood - \"tronpèt, bwachen, gomye-\"and covered with a piece of animal skin or a material capable of awe as the skins in a corner are made goat or cow. These drums can be used like regular congas. It is very difficult to get drums from Haiti into the United States because crafting them is equally challenging due to the finding the right wood and particularly the skins which must be procured under the exact conditions.\n\n"}

'(St.) Basil-pie' or 'king pie', see below) is a New Year's Day bread or cake in Greece and many other areas in eastern Europe and the Balkans which contains a hidden coin or trinket which gives good luck to the receiver, like the Western European king cake. It is associated with Saint Basil's day, January 1, in most of Greece, but in some regions, the traditions surrounding a cake with a hidden coin are attached to Epiphany or to Christmas. It is made of a variety of dough, depending on regional and family tradition, including tsoureki. In some families, instead of dough, it is made from a custard base called galatopita (literally milk-pita). The pie is also known as Chronópita (Χρονόπιτα < χρόνος: \"chrónos ⇨ time/year\" + πίτα: \"píta ⇨ pie\"), meaning New Year's Pie. \n\nIn other areas of the Balkans, the tradition of cake with a hidden coin during winter holidays exists, but is not associated with Saint Basil at all. The practice is documented among Ukrainians (a pirog is cut); Romanians; Serbs (\"česnica\", eaten on Christmas); Albanians (\"pitta\", eaten by both Christians and Muslims); Bulgarians (\"pogacha\", \"Novogodishna banitsa\" (for New Year's), \"Svety Vasileva pogacha\"); \"etc.\"\n\nOn New Year's Day families cut the vasilopita to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. This is usually done at the midnight of New Year's Eve. A coin is hidden in the bread by slipping it into the dough before baking. At midnight the sign of the cross is etched with a knife across the cake. A piece of cake is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, by order of age from eldest to youngest. Slices are also cut for various symbolic people or groups, depending on local and family tradition. They may include the Lord, St. Basil and other saints, the poor, the household, or the Kallikantzaroi. In older times, the coin often was a valuable one, such as a gold sovereign. Nowadays there is often a prearranged gift, money, or otherwise, to be given to the coin recipient.\n\nMany private or public institutions, such as societies, clubs, workplaces, companies, etc., cut their vasilopita at a convenient time between New Year's Day and the beginning of the Great Lent, in celebrations that range from impromptu potluck gatherings to formal receptions or balls.\n\nSaint Basil's Feast Day is observed on January 1, the beginning of the New Year and the Epiphany season known as the \"Vasilopita Observance\".\n\nHasluck (1927) connects both the western and the eastern celebrations to the ancient Greek \"Kronia\", the festival of Cronus, which involved selecting a \"king\" by lot, and then the Roman Saturnalia. The traditions surrounding vasilopita are very similar to western European celebrations of the Twelfth Night and Epiphany: the king cake of France and Louisiana and the tortell in Catalonia.\n\nNonetheless, in popular tradition, vasilopita is associated with a legend of Basil of Caesarea. According to one story, Basil called on the Roman citizens of Caesarea to raise a ransom payment to stop the siege of the city. Each member of the city gave whatever they had in gold and jewelry. When the ransom was raised, the enemy was so embarrassed by the act of collective giving that he called off the siege without collecting payment. Basil was then tasked with returning the unpaid ransom, but had no way to know which items belonged to which family so he baked all of the jewellery into loaves of bread and distributed the loaves to the city, and by a miracle each citizen received their exact share. In some tellings, the sieging tribal chief is replaced with an evil emperor levying a tax or simply with Basil attempting to give charity to the poor without embarrassing them.\n\nIn Bulgarian cuisine, pita or pitka () is served on special occasions. It is a round bread loaf, which can sometimes be flavoured. Its preparation and consumption can have a ritual meaning. For example, on the night before Christmas Eve, ( - \"Badni vecher\") each housewife prepares a pita and decorates it with symbols to bring fertility to the cattle and a rich harvest from the fields, as well as prosperity to each member of the household. She hides a coin in it. Whoever finds the coin will be the healthiest and the wealthiest of the family. Prior to marriage, a bride's future mother-in-law prepares a pita for the newlyweds and sifts the flour seven times, so that the pita will be soft as their future life together. Pita is also prepared for guests. A traditional welcome in Bulgaria includes pita and honey or salt. The meaning of this ritual can be found in the expression \"to welcome someone with bread and salt\" (since bread is an important part of Bulgarian cuisine - and as a Bulgarian proverb says, \"no one is bigger than bread\", and the salt is the basic ingredient that gives flavour to every meal). \n\nThe name \"βασιλόπιτα\" comes from βασιλεύς 'king' + πίτα 'cake', but was reinterpreted as \"Basil's (Βασίλειος) cake\". In Cyprus it is also known as vasilopoulla (\"βασιλοπούλλα\").\n"}

It is one of the dishes served on Good Friday. \n\nThere are various preparations of the dish. It is generally composed of toasted bolillo (which is like the French baguette) and soaked in a mulled syrup made of the following: whole cane sugar, which is known as piloncillo; clove; and cinnamon sticks. Some of the typical ingredients include nuts, seeds, and dried (and sometimes fresh) fruits, among these are: apples, dates, raisins, apricots, peanuts, pecans, almonds, pine nuts and walnuts. In addition, aged cheese is added, which might explain why some people's recipes call for milk. Many \"capirotada\" recipes do not include any meat. Other recipes include meat as a layer. The ingredients are largely the same as those used during the 1640s to make breads and cakes. These ingredients and recipes have been recorded by the Holy Office of the Inquisition and saved to this day in the archives.\n\nThe basic ingredients carry a rich symbolism to the Passion of Christ, and the dish is considered by many Mexican and Mexican-American families as a reminder of the suffering of Christ on Good Friday. The bread represents the Body of Christ, the syrup is his blood, the cloves are the nails of the cross, and the whole cinnamon sticks are the wood of the cross. The melted cheese stands for the Holy Shroud.\n\n\n"}

The tradition holds that the Minister of Finance should purchase or wear new shoes when the budget is delivered.\n\nThe exact origins of this tradition are not known. The observance of this tradition has been inconsistent among federal ministers; indeed, for two or three finance ministers, this tradition only holds if \"new shoes\" is interpreted to mean \"new footwear\". It also makes appearances among provincial finance ministers.\n\nWhile several Canadian parliamentary traditions have their origins in Britain, new shoes on budget day does not. Donald M. Fleming in 1960 was the first Minister of Finance known to follow a practice that was already being described in the media as \"traditional\", with one account claiming that the tradition of wearing \"something new\" began as early as Sir John Rose's first budget of 1868.\n\nWalter L. Gordon, the next Finance Minister, did not wear new shoes for his three budgets from 1963 to 1965, but his successor Mitchell Sharp wore new shoes on budget day in 1966 after he was told that doing so was a tradition; \"Later, I learned there was no tradition behind it at all\", Sharp said. The following year there were two budgets, one in June where he wore new shoes and one in November. Sharp wore the same pair of shoes in November, as budget day fell on St. Andrew's Day. He said, \"being a Scot, and this being the second budget I have presented this year, I am wearing the same shoes that I wore when I presented the budget on June 1.\"\n\nFollowing Sharp, Edgar Benson wore a new pair of shoes on budget day in 1968, although he said, \"He didn't buy them just for the budget.\" The following year he did not wear new shoes when delivering the budget, saying jokingly that he couldn't afford them, and in 1970 proudly displayed his worn soles on budget day.\n\nWhether the next two Finance Ministers, John Turner and Donald Macdonald, delivered their budgets with new shoes is unknown. Macdonald's successor Jean Chrétien wore new shoes for both of his budgets of 1978. The next minister, John Crosbie, wore used mukluks in 1979 for his only budget. Following Crosbie, whether Allan MacEachen wore new shoes is unknown, but in 1984 his successor, Marc Lalonde, did for his second budget. Michael Wilson wore new shoes for the first four of the six budgets he presented beginning in 1985.\n\nWilson's successor, Donald Mazankowski, did not wear new shoes for his only one, in 1992. Paul Martin wore new work boots he received as a gift from Chrétien for his first budget, in 1994, but did not wear new footwear with subsequent budgets. John Manley did not wear new shoes for the one budget he tabled, in 2003. His successor, Ralph Goodale, released two budgets in 2004 and 2005, and wore new shoes both times.\n\nJim Flaherty wore new shoes for his first budget in 2006. For the second one, instead of wearing new shoes, he bought ice skates for his son. and resoled his shoes to show that his 2008 budget was fiscally prudent. Flaherty did not purchase new shoes for either of his two 2011 budgets, but did so in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and February 7th, 2014.\n\nFlaherty's successor, Joe Oliver, wore New Balance shoes with blue laces to underscore the fact that the Conservatives' 2015 budget was balanced. (The Conservative Party of Canada party colour is blue.) However, commenters pointed out that the shoes were made in the U.S., by a company that had abandoned Canadian manufacturing 20 years earlier.\n\nFor her first two provincial budgets, Carole Taylor wore new shoes.<ref name=\"Vancouver Sun 2/21/2007\"></ref> For her third budget, she wore new green-coloured shoes to go with the environmental focus of her budget.\n\nIn 2005, Colin Hansen wore new running shoes when he released his only budget.<ref name=\"Vancouver Sun 2/15/2005\"></ref>\n\nIn 2001, Minister of Finance Paul Ramsay wore new shoes when he delivered his budget. His predecessor, Joy MacPhail, did the same with a second-hand set when she tabled her budget.<ref name=\"Ottawa Citizen 3/25/2007\"></ref>\n\nOnce, when he was Alberta Treasurer, Stockwell Day wore inline skates and a helmet when he tabled a budget.\nFor at least one of the budgets he released, Floyd Laughren wore new shoes.<ref name=\"Wellend Tribune 6/13/2002\"></ref>\n\nIn 2007, Greg Sorbara wore new shoes when he released Ontario's provincial budget.\n\nIn 2002, New Brunswick finance minister Peter Mesheau wore new hiking boots when he delivered his budget.\n\nIn 2009, Nova Scotia finance minister Graham Steele polished his shoes when, as he later said, \"we buffed up the previously introduced Progressive Conservative budget\". In 2010 he bought children's shoes to represent the removal of the Harmonized Sales Tax from children's clothing. In 2011 Steele showed pictures of new shoes on a Blackberry Playbook because of the manufacturer's importance to the province, and in 2012 he bought shoes at a store to symbolize lowered taxes for small businesses.\n\nIn 1989, Quebec Finance Minister Gérard D. Levesque presented the budget in new shoes.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 5/16/1989\"></ref>\n\nIn 2003, Pauline Marois presented Quebec's budget in new shoes.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 3/11/2003\"></ref>\n\nIn 2006, Michel Audet wore new shoes when he delivered his budget speech.<ref name=\"Charlottetown Guardian 3/23/2006\"></ref>\n\nIn 2002, Pat Mella was speaking to journalists about PEI's budget when the Premier interrupted and presented her with a pair of sandals.<ref name=\"Charlottetown Guardian 3/27/2002\"></ref>\n\nSaskatchewan finance minister Ken Krawetz first bought a new pair of shoes for budget day in 2013. He put them on with a shoehorn to demonstrate that the province faces what the minister described as \"significant financial pressures on the treasury\".\nIn 1999, Finance Minister Kelvin Ng wore caribou-skin boots when he tabled Nunavut's budget.\n\nWearing new shoes on budget day (or the refusal to do so) has been used as a symbol by politicians. Stockwell Day's outfit as Alberta Treasurer was intended to highlight \"a new direction\" for the budget. The tradition has been around for so long that, as Nova Scotia's Steele said after leaving his position, \"It's hard to be original ... Every gimmick has been done\", and passers by often ask finance ministers in the days before new budgets whether they have purchased new shoes yet.\n"}

The pastry is coated with sesame seeds on the outside and is crisp and chewy. Inside the pastry is a large hollow, caused by the expansion of the dough. The hollow of the pastry is filled with a filling usually consisting of lotus paste, or alternatively sweet black bean paste, or less commonly red bean paste. They are also sometimes referred to as sesame balls ().\n\nDepending on the region and cultural area, \"jian dui\" is known as \"matuan\" (麻糰) in northern China, \"ma yuan\" (麻圆) in northeast China, and \"zhen dai\" (珍袋) in Hainan. In American Chinese restaurants and pastry shops, they are known as sesame seed balls.\n\nThe origins of \"jian dui\" can be traced back to the Tang dynasty as a palace food in Chang'an, known as \"lüdui\" (碌堆). This food item was also recalled in a poem by the Tang poet Wang Fanzhi. With the southward migration of many peoples from central China, the \"jian dui\" was brought along and hence became part of southern Chinese cuisine.\n\nIn Hong Kong, it is one of the most standard pastries. It can also be found in most Chinatown bakery shops overseas.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and northeast Sri Lanka, it is known as \"ellu urundai\" or \"ellurundai\" (எள்ளுருண்டை), the local word meaning sesame ball. It is made in different sizes and colors. It is usually filled with sesame seeds, jaggery, sugar, or glucose syrup.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, it is called \"onde-onde\", filled with sweetened mung bean paste. People usually eat it as snack. This pastry is also popular and widely available in Indo (Eurasian), Indonesian and Vietnamese outlets in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Japan, it is known as . It is often sold at street fairs, in Chinese districts, and at various restaurants.\n\nIn Korea, it is called \"chamkkaegyeongdan\"(, \"sesame rice ball cake\"), or \"jungguksik chamkkaegyeongdan\"(, \"Chinese-style sesame rice ball cake\") to avoid confusion with Korean-style sesame rice ball cake (\"gyeongdan\") with sesame coating. As the Chinese \"jian dui\" is first coated with sesame seeds then deep-fried, while the Korean \"gyeongdan\" is first steamed then coated with toasted sesame seeds, \"jian dui\" is also called \"twigin chamkkaegyeongdan\"(, \"deep-fried sesame rice ball cake\").\n\nIt is known as \"kuih bom\", which is usually filled with shredded sweetened coconut, or nuts. Occasionally, it may be filled with red bean paste.\n\nAmong the mainly Hakka-speaking ethnic Chinese in the state of Sabah, \"jian dui\" is more commonly known as \"you chi\".\n\nIn the Philippines, \"jian dui\" is called \"butsi\" (Spanish: \"buchi\"). Due to hundreds of years of Chinese settlement in the Philippines, the integration of Chinese cuisine (particularly Cantonese and Fujian) to local dishes has made \"buchi\" quite popular. To an extent, it has already been considered an icon of Chinese Filipino culinary tradition, sometimes associated with auspiciousness. As it is well-known among ethnic Chinese and other Filipinos alike, local restaurants which are sometimes not even Chinese and fastfood chains such as Chowking have added the delicacy to the menu. Aside from the usual lotus and red bean paste, non-Chinese and indigenous ingredients have also been used for variety such as \"ube\"-flavored \"butsi\".

{"id": "10283965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10283965", "title": "Hardcourt Bike Polo", "text": "Hardcourt Bike Polo\n\nHardcourt Bike Polo is a variation of traditional Bicycle Polo in which teams of players ride bicycles and use mallets to strike a small ball into a goal. It may also be referred to as \"Hardcourt\", \"Urban Bike Polo\" or simply \"Bike Polo\".\n\nThere are two types of hardcourt bike polo. One is the traditional style called \"3v3\", which is a team consisting of 3 players and games are usually around 10–15 minutes in length. The other form is \"Squad\". Squad is a team of 5-6 players and games are between 30–60 minutes, allowing for substitutions. Typically, players play in an enclosed rectangular area, called a \"court\". Goals are placed at each long end of the court.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the ball is placed in the middle of the court while the players wait behind their own goals. Following a countdown or a whistle, a player from each team charges the ball in what is termed the \"joust\".\n\nA player may hit the ball in two ways: a \"shot\" or a \"shuffle\". A shot is made with either end of the mallet head whereas a shuffle is made with the side. In order to score a goal, a player must hit the ball into the opposing team's goal with a \"shot\"; if the player uses a shuffle, the goal does not count and play continues.\n\nFollowing a goal, the scoring team returns to their own half of the court. After the scoring team returns to their half, the scored-on team may cross the half line and resume play.\n\nThe game continues until a team reaches either a limit of a predetermined length of time, depending on the format. 3v3 games are typically 10–15 minutes, while Squad games are typically 30–60 minutes.\n\nA player who \"dabs\", (touches a horizontal surface with their foot), must undertake some form of remedial penalty before making contact with the ball again. This usually involves \"tapping out\" (riding to a designated point on the court and touching it with the mallet). It is also common to have to say \"foot down\" or \"dab\" to let other players know you are out of play, but not required. You should avoid affecting play of the game at all cost after a foot down occurs.\n\nThe amount of contact in a particular game may vary but is generally restricted to \"mallet to mallet\", \"body to body\". A \"check\" is allowed as long as it's \"shoulder to shoulder\" and deemed safe by the referee.\n\nAs a decentralized and organically growing game, the rules and styles of Hardcourt Bike Polo may vary substantially from city to city. The North American Bike Polo Association has created an official set of rules for North America, which has been influential to standardizing rules world-wide.\n\nSince 2009, various governing bodies have been created within the polo community for the purposes of advancing the sport and creating rule sets. The North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Association (NAHBPA) and European Hardcourt (EHBP) are the prime organizations, but there are others such as the Australasian Hardcourt (AHBP) and Bici Polo Latinoamerica (BPLA) organizations coming up as Bike polo spreads to other continents and countries all over the world.\n\nThere are currently two types of tournament formats in hardcourt bike polo: 3v3 and Squad.\n\n3v3 is the more traditional format of hardcourt bike polo, where 2 teams of 3 players play against each other.\n\nAn alternate format is Squad, where 2 teams of anywhere from 5-6 players play against each other. In Squad format, there are still 3 players on each team on the court at one time, but there is a bench of players that can be substituted throughout the game. Squad format games tend to be longer in duration, typically 30–60 minutes. There is usually a team captain in charge of substitutions, who may or may not be a player.\n\nRather than use traditional wooden polo mallets, Hardcourt Bike Polo players started making handmade mallets in the spirit of the DIY ethic. Since then, a number of companies have appeared, which are producing more distinct equipment, specifically for bike polo. Typical mallets are constructed using heads made from UHMW, and aluminium shafts similar to ski poles.\n\nThe ball used in bike polo is typically made from PVC and is identical to a Street Hockey ball. In 2012, the company, Fixcraft, team up with D-Gel, makers of hockey products, to produce the first official bike polo ball.\n\nSome players make wheel covers out of corrugated plastic, polycarbonate, plastic netting, or even thick fabrics to protect spokes and create solid blocking surfaces. Many of these covers are painted with elaborate designs to help identify riders or their city's club. \nLow gear ratio single-speed bikes have advantages for quick acceleration and control on a small court. Although any bike is acceptable for the game, eventually most players customize their bikes especially for bike polo and their playing needs. Most riders prefer a short wheelbase for tight turning and a smaller \"5-hole\" as well as a medium to long stem for better turning. Front brake or dual brake setups are the most popular.\n\nPlayers commonly play on courts such as tennis courts, street hockey rinks, basketball courts, or football courts. These are often customized using boards to keep the ball from rolling out of the court or getting stuck in the corners. The NAH currently mandates goals be 3 ft x 6 ft and must be placed no closer than 6 ft from the backboard. Court size does vary, but for a court to be used in an official NAH event it must be no larger than 155 ft x 80 ft (47.25m x 25m) and no smaller than 120 ft x 60 ft (37m x 18m), and have 4 ft high solid boards.\n\nSome cities have worked with their local Polo club and have built facilities specifically for polo or suited for multi-use activities like Polo. Some courts like New York City's \"The Pit\" are repurposed spaces, while other courts like East Vancouver's court in Grandview Park, are specifically designed to meet the needs of the sport.\n\nModern Hardcourt Bike Polo has roots in early 2000s Seattle Originally started by messengers who had downtime in between deliveries, the game developed in Seattle and some of the earlier rules were founded (3 on 3, scoring with the end of the mallet). As people moved and traveled the game branched out. and is currently played in over 30 countries and 300 cities.\n\nSince 2004, cities across North America have thrown inter-city tournaments such as the East-, West-, and Northside Polo Invites.\n\nThe first annual North American and European Hardcourt Bicycle Polo championships were both held in August 2009. The European tournament drew over 40 teams from Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and Germany and was won by L'Equipe, a team from Geneva. The North American tournament featured 36 teams from Seattle, Vancouver BC, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York, Ottawa, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere and was won by Team Smile from Seattle. First prize for each tournament were tickets to the 2009 World Championships.\n\nThe first ever world championships where held in Toronto in 2008 as part of the Cycle Messenger World Championships. There were representatives from Europe, however, hardcourt polo was still relatively new and the European teams elected not to play in the elimination bracket after seeing the level of play from the North American teams. Heat Lightning (Doug Dalrymple, Paul Rauen, and Zach Blackburn) became the first ever world champions, using a high energy \"die by the sword\" playing strategy. The following year, 2009, featured teams from the US, Canada, England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The winners were the current North American Champions, Team Smile, who defeated the team from East Vancouver in a repeat of the North American final.\n\nNational championships are held in countries around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n"}

In Poland, rye is traditional, making żur or żurek; a variant made with wheat flour instead of rye is known in Poland as barszcz biały (\"white borscht\"). Fermented wheat or sourdough soups are also found in other western Slavic nations such as the Slovak (kyslóvka), Silesian (Sauermehlsuppe) and Czech (kyselo – with mushrooms and without meat) cuisines.\n\nThe sour rye soup (; ;, \"zhur, kisyalitsa\") is a soup made of soured rye flour (akin to sourdough) and meat (usually boiled pork sausage or pieces of smoked sausage, bacon or ham). It is specific to the cuisine of Poland, where it is known as żur or żurek (diminutive).\n\nIn Poland it is sometimes served in an edible bowl made of bread or with boiled potatoes. The recipe varies from region to region.\n\nIn Silesia, a type of sour rye soup known as \"żur śląski\" is served in a bowl, poured over mashed potatoes. In the Podlaskie region, it is common to eat \"żurek\" with halved hard-boiled eggs.\n\nIn Poland \"żurek\" is traditionally eaten at Easter, but is also popular during other parts of the year. It is sometimes flavored with bits of sausage, usually eaten with bread or buns, or even served in a bowl made from bread.\n\nThe Polish name 'żur' (diminutive: 'żurek') comes from the Middle High German word 'sūr' ('sauer' in modern German), meaning sour.\n\nKyselo (or krkonošské kyselo) (, ) is a soup based on sourdough and mushrooms. It is a traditional Czech cuisine from poor folk food originating in the Northern Bohemia mountain region Krkonoše. It is very substantial and it contains an abundance of quality proteins, B vitamins, dietary fiber and other important nutrients. Usage of sourdough is closely related to fermented flour usage in the Polish sour rye soup.\n\nKyselo has been a traditional daily food of poor people in the Krkonoše mountain region for centuries, primarily in the winter. It is made from locally accessible, cheap, storable ingredients (the mushrooms are usually used dried) and nutritious ingredients so it provides substantial energy for hard mountain life and work. Historically kyselo was made without eggs. Eggs in early times were produced mainly for sale on the market, not for one's own family, so eggs were only eaten on some holidays. Potatoes became widespread among poor people of Czech lands in the late 18th century, so before that time soups of this type were also made without potatoes.\n\nUsage of sourdough indicates that kyselo has ancient origins, probably in medieval (and prehistoric) fermented cereal porridges.\n\nThe Krkonoše region is on the Czech–Polish border, and kyselo is a close relative of the famous Polish sour rye soup. Other Slavic cuisines also have variations of soups based on soured flour or other modes of fermentation, such as Russian okroshka. Finnish hapanvelli soup is made by pea and sour dough. More distant relative of kyselo is for example Japanese miso soup, which also uses a fermented basic ingredient – miso paste.\n\nAs a staple food, kyselo plays an important part in local legends and fairy tales, especially in connection to the mythical mountain lord Krakonoš (). It is said that he gave sourdough to people and invented kyselo. In Krkonoše there is also a mountain named \"Kotel\" (, ) which means cauldron. When fog rises from the valley at bottom of Kotel, people say that Krakonoš is cooking the kyselo.\n\nThe name \"kyselo\" (but not the taste of soup itself, which is strictly regional) is well known in throughout the Czech Republic because of Večerníček children's television series \"Krkonošské pohádky\" (\"Fairy Tales from Krkonoše\"), in which Anče, one of the main characters, cooks kyselo in almost all of the episodes.\n\nThe word \"kyselo\" is derived from in the word \"kyselý\", which in Czech language means \"sour\". The sourdough which kyselo is made from is called \"chlebový kvásek\" or \"chlebový kvas\" (not to be confused with the Russian \"kvass\").\n\nSometimes another sour mushroom-based Czech soup kulajda or its variants are mistakenly called \"kyselo\". The difference is that \"kulajda\" and similar soups do not use sourdough but sour cream or milk and vinegar. To reduce this misunderstanding, kyselo is often called \"Krkonošské kyselo\" (\"Kyselo of Krkonoše\").\n\nIn Eastern regions of the Czech Republic and in Slovakia there is a soup called kyselica (soup), but it is a variation of sauerkraut soup.\n\nThe basis of kyselo is strong broth made from mushrooms and caraway in water. It is thickened by sourdough which is poured into the broth. Then it is supplemented by onion sautéed in butter, boiled and then roasted potatoes and scrambled eggs and seasoned with salt and vinegar.\n\nDue to its ancient origins, kyselo has no fixed recipe and the preparation is a little different in every family. The recipe is passed on by oral tradition. There are local variants of kyselo in Krkonoše: without eggs or with hard-boiled eggs, boiled but not roasted potatoes, with or without cream, etcetera.\n\nNowadays one can purchase an industry-made instant powder kyselo base for use in big canteens.\n\nSourdough is the first basic ingredient of kyselo. It should ideally be made from rye flour. It can be bought at local food stores in Krkonoše. In the rest of the world it may be bought at some bakeries or it can be made from water, flour and allowed to attract wild yeast. Families in Krkonoše usually grew their own sourdough for years in special cookware called \"kyselák\" or \"kvasák\".\n\nMushrooms are the second most important ingredient in kyselo. Central European edible species such as cep and similar species are used. The mushrooms are usually used dried in the winter.\n\nKyselo is traditionally served hot in a soup plate or bowl. In some restaurants it is served in an edible bread bowl. Sometimes it is garnished with chopped scallion, parsley or other green herbs. The soup is eaten with a tablespoon. The potatoes are often served on a special plate (one for the whole table) and everyone can add any quantity as needed. Usually salt and vinegar are also on the table for personal seasoning preferences.\n\nKyselo is a very nutritious food so it is often served as a main (and only) course, but in small quantities it could be also served as an entrée.\n\n"}
