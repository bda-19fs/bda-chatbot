{"id": "30875458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30875458", "title": "Croquette", "text": "Croquette\n\nA croquette (/kroʊˈket/) is a small breadcrumbed fried food roll containing, usually as main ingredients, ground meat (veal, beef, chicken, or turkey), shellfish, fish, ham, cheese, mashed potatoes or vegetables, and mixed with béchamel or brown sauce, and soaked white bread, egg, onion, spices and herbs, wine, milk, beer, or some combination, sometimes with a filling, e.g. sautéed onions, mushrooms, or boiled eggs. The croquette is usually shaped into a cylinder, disk, or oval shape, and then deep-fried. The croquette (from the French \"croquer\", \"to crunch\") gained worldwide popularity, both as a delicacy and as a fast food.\n\nMashed potato-filled croquettes are often served as a side dish in winter holiday meals, such as Christmas. In fast food cuisine, varieties exist without potatoes, but with cheese, beef, or goulash, often in a filling based on béchamel sauce.\n\nThe dish was created in France. In 1898 Monsieur Escoffier, the founder of the classical French Cuisine, together with the help of Monsieur Philias Gilbert, started to write down the recipe. It was originally made with beef.\n\nA potato-filled croquette called \"aloo tikki\", which originated in the Indian subcontinent, is very popular in northern India and is typically served with a stew. They are mostly eaten as snacks at home and are also popularly sold by road-side vendors. In West Bengal, it is called \"alu chop\", as in Bangladesh. Sometimes it is called a \"cutlet\" and eaten plain or as a fast food variation that is served inside a hamburger bun (like a vegetarian burger). Meat croquettes called \"kababs\" are made with minced mutton. Lightly spiced beef croquettes are a popular snack and appetiser among the Christian communities in Goa and Kerala.\n\nThe \"kroket\" (Dutch) made of mashed potato filled with minced chicken or ragout is one of the most popular snack items in Indonesia, introduced during the Dutch colonial rule. The \"kroket\" is made by putting chicken filling inside a mashed potato ball which is then breaded and fried.\n\nA relative of the croquette, known as \"korokke\" (コロッケ) is a very popular fried food, widely available in supermarkets and butcher shops, as well as from specialty \"korokke\" shops. Generally patty-shaped, it is mainly made of potatoes with some other ingredients such as vegetables (e.g. onions and carrots) and maybe less than 5% meat (e.g. pork or beef). It is often served with \"tonkatsu\" (とんかつ) sauce. Cylinder-shaped \"korokke\" are also served, which more closely resemble the French version, where seafood (prawns or crab meat) or chicken in white sauce (\"ragout\") is cooled down to make it harden before the croquette is breaded and deep-fried. When it is served hot, the inside melts. This version is called \"cream \"korokke\"\" to distinguish it from the potato-based variety. It is often served with no sauce or tomato sauce. Unlike its French cousin, croquettes made mainly of meat are not called \"korokke\" in Japan. They are called \"menchi katsu\" (メンチカツ), short for minced meat cutlets.\n\nUsually called \"goroke\" (고로케) or \"keuroket\" (크로켓), it is a food sold in most bread shops in Korea. The most common type is deep fried rolls stuffed with \"japchae\" (잡채) ingredients or chicken curry and mashed potato with vegetable salad. Also, \"goroke\" are sometimes filled with \"kimchi\", pork, and \"bulgogi\" ingredients. Many Korean stores often advertise the \"goroke\" as a French product and they are usually sold in most European-style bread stores all over Korea.\n\nAlmost every restaurant offers \"kroketten/croquettes\" as a side dish, and when served this way, they always mean the variety filled with mashed potatoes.\nAs the ubiquitous main dish in Belgian restaurants, croquettes are completely different from the potato filled variety served as a simple side dish. The two most popular traditional Belgian croquettes have a thick and creamy bechamel filling mixed with grey shrimps \"garnaalkroketten/croquettes de crevettes\" or cheese \"kaaskroketten/croquettes de fromage\". Most menus offer both either as a starter or a main course.\nYou'll find croquettes served almost everywhere in Belgium and the quality comes down to the filling. As a main dish they are usually served with a salad, fried parsley and frites.\nMore adventurous chefs have experimented with the classic formula, adding endives, asparagus, goat's cheese or beer to their fillings\n\nThe ragout-filled dish was regarded as a French cuisine delicacy, first described in a recipe from 1691 by the chef of the French king Louis XIV and using ingredients such as truffles, sweetbreads, and cream cheese. From the 1800s onwards, it became a way to use up leftover stewed meat.\n\nPlain potato croquettes are served as a side dish in restaurants and are also available frozen in supermarkets. They are usually called \"Kroketten\" (singular \"Krokette\").\n\n\"Krokett\" is a small cylindrical croquette similar to the Czech variety: potatoes, eggs, flour, and butter, seasoned with nutmeg and salt and deep-fried in oil. This variety can be ordered in most restaurants as a side dish, and also bought frozen. When made with cottage cheese, they are called \"túrókrokett\".\n\nIn Italy, \"crocchette\" (named in the south as \"crocchè\") are made mainly with crushed potatoes or vegetables, like aubergines (\"crocchette di melanzane\").\n\nPlain potato croquettes are available frozen or refrigerated in most supermarkets. They are also homemade, usually with the addition of chopped onion.\n\nAfter World War II, several suppliers started mass-producing croquettes filled with beef. The croquette (\"kroket\" or \"kroketten\" in Dutch) subsequently became even more popular as a fast food; meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs which is subsequently deep-fried. Its success as a fast food garnered its reputation as a cheap dish of dubious quality, to such an extent that Dutch tongue in cheek urban myths relate its \"allegedly mysterious content\" to offal and butchering waste. Research in 2008 showed that 350 million \"kroketten\" are eaten in the Netherlands every year. An estimated 75% of all Dutch people eat them, resulting in 29 \"kroketten\" per person per year on average, being the 2nd most popular Dutch snack after the frikandel. The major consumers are between 35 and 49 years old.\n\nThe success of the croquette led to a whole series of food products resembling the croquette, but with other types of fillings, such as noodles, rice and kidney, and with names like \"bamibal\", \"nasibal\", and \"nierbroodje\" instead of croquette. Variants of the croquette which specify the kind of meat can also be found, like \"rundvleeskroket\" (made with beef) and \"kalfsvleeskroket\" (made with veal). Also popular in Dutch snack bars are the \"satékroket\" (where the filling consists of a peanut satay sauce and shredded meat in a ragout) and the goulashkroket. A smaller round version of the standard beef or veal croquette, the \"bitterbal\", is often served with mustard as a snack in bars and at receptions. Potato croquettes and potato balls (similar to potato croquettes, but small and round) can be bought frozen in most food stores.\n\n\"\", a croquette on a bread roll, is sold in restaurants, snack shops, and even by street vendors. The popularity of the \"kroket\" in the Netherlands is such that even McDonald's sells their version on a bun as \"McKroket\".\n\nCroquettes in Poland are typically made from a thin, rolled crepe-type pancake stuffed with meat, mushrooms, cabbage, sauerkraut, or some combinations of those ingredients. The croquette is lightly pan fried before serving.\nSome recipe variations also require the croquette to be covered in breadcrumbs before frying, and served with a clear soup e.g. \"barszcz\", similar to borscht.\n\n\"Croquetes\" are cylindrical, covered in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. They are usually made with white sauce and beef, sometimes mixed with varying amounts of pork, and frequently with some \"chouriço\", black pepper or \"piri-piri\" to add more flavour. Seafood, fish (other than codfish) and vegetarian (potato) croquetes are also eaten in Portugal, but those have other names (such as \"rissol, pastel, empada\"), thus the name croquete refers only to the Dutch-style beef \"croquette\".\n\nThe widespread minced cutlet () is made of minced meat (beef or pork or mixture of both, chicken, turkey, or fish), bread, eggs, white onions, salt and spices, shaped as a meat patty and pan fried. Bread is added in amount up to 25% of meat, adding softness to the final product and also making it cheaper to produce. The Pozharsky cutlet is a well-known variety of such cutlets in which minced meat is mixed with butter.\n\nTraditional \"croquetas\" in Spain are made with thick béchamel. They are one of the most typical \"tapas\" dishes, especially filled with \"jamón\", chicken or cod. Also, many bars and restaurants may offer novel, less traditional versions of croquettes with more varied fillings and ingredients such as apple, wild mushrooms, \"morcilla\" (blood sausage), cheeses, tuna, cuttlefish (using its ink to give color and flavour), etc.\n\nCroquettes are available frozen or refrigerated in most supermarkets, typically with potato filling.\n\nCroquettes are typically made out of ham or chicken in Puerto Rico, where they are dipped in what is colloquially known as \"mayo-ketchup\", a variation of fry sauce. Frozen croquettes are sold in supermarkets in Puerto Rico.\n\nCuban croquettes are nearly identical to the Puerto Rican croquettes that are typically made out of ham or chicken, but the Cuban croquette is much more popular. Not only that, but there is a common cheese and potato variation, and they are sometimes made with fish.\n\nDominican croquettes are nearly identical to the Cuban croquettes that are typically made out of ham or chicken, but there is a common cheese and potato variation, a beef variation and they are also sometimes made with fish.\n\nAruban croquettes are more commonly made out of mashed potato, ground beef, shellfish, and fish. They are eaten as an early morning breakfast or as snacks any time of the day. They are considered as one of the island's cultural foods.\n\nCroquettes are usually made of tuna or chicken and potatoes.\nIn southern Mexico, a variety is made with fresh cheese, plantain, and black beans.\n\n\"Boardwalk\" fish cakes and crab cakes, eaten on the east coast of the United States, are essentially croquettes. They consist, respectively, of chopped fish or crab meat, mixed in a buttery dough which is then breaded and deep-fried.\n\nA deviled crab (\"croqueta de jaiba\") is a particular variety of a blue crab croquette from Tampa, Florida. The crab meat is seasoned with a unique Cuban-style enchilada or \"sofrito\" sauce (locally known as \"chilau\"), breaded with stale Cuban bread crumbs, formed into the approximate shape of a prolate spheroid, and fried. It is meant to be eaten with one hand. It originated in the immigrant community of Ybor City during a cigar workers' strike in the 1920s and is still very popular in the area.\n\nOther types of crab and fish croquettes are made throughout the southern U.S., especially in coastal states such as Louisiana where seafood dishes are common staples. These varieties have different seasonings and shapes, with some served inside the scooped-out shell of the crab.\n\nA traditional New England/Northeastern United States preparation uses ham, usually of the maple-cured variety, along with cooked mashed potato (often mixed with some mild seasonings and milk or butter for a smoother consistency) for the outer roll. These are dipped in crumbed breading, and sautéed or fried in a small skillet using butter. Typically, these are most common during the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday season as one of several ways to use up leftover holiday ham.\n\nAnother croquette dish popular across much of the American South is salmon croquettes. Any canned fish - usually salmon or mackerel, although canned tuna is also used in some recipes (although the dish is often colloquially referred to as \"salmon croquettes\" or \"salmon patties\" regardless of the actual fish used) - is mashed by hand to break up any fish bones and give the fish meat a smoother consistency, then combined with a binder and various seasonings. Seasonings typically include pepper, salt, chopped (sometimes sautéed) onions, garlic, lemon juice or paprika. The binder can be any starch such as flour, cornmeal, ground crackers of any type, even white rice, matzo meal, or oatmeal - although these latter variations are not as common, and are mostly limited to the northern U.S. Chopped eggs, parsley, and Parmesan cheese may also be added. The mixture is then shaped into rounded patties for pan- or deep-frying; corn or peanut oil are the most commonly used frying oils in the southern U.S., but canola, safflower, or olive oil are also used, and some recipes call specifically for pan-frying in butter or margarine.\n\nCroquettes, primarily made from beef, are common in many parts of Brazil. The \"coxinha\" is a popular chicken-based croquette, intentionally shaped to look like a chicken thigh.\n\nFrom Riobamba llapingachos are potato cakes with a cheese filling, fried in oil with achiote and served with a peanut sauce.\n\nCalled \"croquetas\" in Spanish, the most popular stuffings are mashed potatoes (croquetas de papa), ham and mozzarella cheese (croquetas de jamón y queso), and rice (croquetas de arroz). Sometimes, the rice ones have herbs and little ham cubes. Generally, their shape is cylindrical and they're medium-sized, but bigger, spherical ones also can be seen (specially with rice stuffing). They are deep-fried in oil.\n\nThe average Uruguayan eats them usually with mayonnaise or ketchup. Croquetas are very common: they can be bought in almost every bakery, supermarket or food shop, and a lot of people cook them at home as a side dish or even main dish. In modern restaurants, more sophisticated croquettes (e.g. with serrano ham and mixture of cheeses, or with salmon) usually come with a more elaborated sauce as dip (e.g. sweet chili sauce), and are ordered as starters (reason why those ones tend to be smaller in size).\n\nIn Colombia croquettes are commonly referred to as \"papa rellena\", which translates as stuffed potato. They consist of a mix of roughly mashed potato, seasoned shredded or ground beef and an egg to bind the mix, which is then lightly battered and deep fried. They are served in bars and casual restaurants, as well as often being served at home for a celebration or party. They are usually served with a side of homemade or bottled chilli sauce.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30876121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30876121", "title": "Instant noodle", "text": "Instant noodle\n\nInstant noodles are a noodle dish, sold in a precooked and dried noodle block, with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil. The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of cup noodles the flavoring is often loose in the cup. Some instant noodle products are seal packed; these can be reheated or eaten straight from the packet/container. Dried noodle blocks are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating, but can be consumed dry.\n\nThe main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually wheat flour, palm oil, and salt. Common ingredients in the flavoring powder are salt, monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar. The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.\n\nInstant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando (born Go Pek-Hok) of Nissin Foods in Japan. They were launched in 1958 under the brand name Chikin Ramen. In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Noodles, the first cup noodle product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under many brand names.\n\nRamen, a Japanese noodle soup, is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.\n\nInstant noodles were invented by Chinese-Japanese inventor Momofuku Ando in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, Nissin, under the brand name Chikin Ramen. Ando developed the entire production method of flash frying noodles from processes of noodle-making, steaming, seasoning, to dehydrating in oil heat, creating the \"instant\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of frozen noodles. Each noodle block was pre-seasoned and sold for 35 yen. The instant noodle became ready to eat just in two minutes by adding boiling water. Due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item initially, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price. Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by Mitsubishi Corporation. Initially gaining popularity across East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia, where they are now firmly embedded within the local cultures of those regions, instant noodles eventually spread to and gained popularity across most other parts of the world.\n\nWith better quality concern, manufacturers further improved the taste of instant noodles by adding flavoring powder in a separate packet. In 1971, Nissin introduced Nissin Cup Noodles, a cup noodle to which boiling water is added to cook the noodles. A further innovation added dried vegetables to the cup, creating a complete instant soup dish. It combined the functions of packaging material, cooker when boiling water, and a bowl when eating noodles. Heading off the recent rise in health-consciousness, many manufacturers launched instant noodles with various healthy recipes: noodles with dietary fiber and collagen, low-calorie noodles, and low-sodium noodles.\n\nAccording to a Japanese poll in the year 2000, \"The Japanese believe that their best invention of the twentieth century was instant noodles.\" , approximately 96 billion servings of instant noodles are eaten worldwide every year. China consumes 42 billion packages of instant noodles per year – 44% of world consumption, Indonesia – 14 billion, Japan – 5.3 billion, Vietnam – 4.8 billion, USA – 4 billion. Per capita, South Koreans consume the greatest amount of instant noodles, 69 per capita per year.\n\nThere are three key ingredients in wheat-based noodles: Wheat flour, water, and salt. Other than the three main ingredients, USDA regulations allow instant noodles to contain palm oil, seasoning, sodium phosphates, potato starches, gums, and other ingredients. Knowing the composition of instant noodles is crucial to understanding the physical chemical properties of the product; therefore, the function of each ingredient listed above is specified below.\n\nNoodles can be made from different kinds of flours, such as wheat flour, rice flour, and buckwheat flour, depending on the various types manufacturers want to make. For instant noodles, flours which have 8.5-12.5% protein are optimal because noodles must be able to withstand the drying process without breaking apart, which requires a higher amount of protein in flour, and during frying, high protein content can help decrease the fat uptake. Gluten, which is made up of glutenin and gliadin, is the most important wheat protein that forms the continuous viscoelastic dough of noodles. The development of gluten structures and the networking between gluten and starches during kneading is very important to the elasticity and continuity of the dough.\n\nWater is the second most important raw material for making noodles after flour. The hydration of dough determines the development of gluten structure, which affects the viscoelastic properties of dough. The water absorption level for making noodles is about 30% - 38% of flour weight; if the water absorption level is too high, hydration of flour can not be completed, and if the water absorption level is too low, the dough will be too sticky to handle during processing. For instant noodles, dehydration is an important step after noodles are made because water can offer a hospitable environment for microorganisms. Depending on dehydration methods, USDA has regulation on moisture content of instant noodles: for instant noodles dehydrated by frying, moisture content cannot exceed 8%, and for those dehydrated by methods other than frying, moisture content cannot exceed 14.5%.\n\nSalt is added when making the flour dough to strengthen gluten structures and enhance the sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is to slow down the activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures, and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because flavonoid pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese ramen, this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content. One pack of ramen contains well over half the daily recommended amount of sodium.\n\nKansui, an alkaline solution consisting usually of a 9:1 ratio of sodium carbonate to potassium carbonate, is added to the flour and water when making ramen to help develop several of its unique characteristics. The addition of kansui aids in the gluten development of the noodle as well as promotion of gelatinization of starches, both of which contribute to the springiness and chewiness characteristic of ramen. Additionally, the addition of kansui enhances the yellow color of ramen noodles by bringing about chromophoric shift of several compounds called flavonoids that are native to wheat flour.\n\nFrying is a common dehydration process for producing instant noodles. Therefore, oil becomes an important component of instant noodles. According to USDA regulation, oil-fried instant noodles should not have fat content higher than 20% of total weight, which means theoretically, amount of oil uptake during frying process could go even higher. Therefore, the high fat content of instant noodles is always the reason why consumers who are pursuing healthy diets would not buy this product. Palm oil is always chosen as the frying oil for instant noodles due to its heat stability and low cost. However, overall, due to the high fat content and low moisture content, instant noodles are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation, and relatively high amount of preservatives are added. Hence, to avoid the generation of off flavors and health-risking compounds, some instant noodles were dehydrated by ways other than frying to reduce the fat content. According to USDA, un-fried instant noodles should have fat content lower than 3%.\n\nPotato starches are commonly added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.\n\nPolyphosphate is used in instant noodles as additive to improve starch gelatinization during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.\n\nHydrocolloids such as guar gum are widely used in instant noodles production to enhance water binding capacity during rehydration and shorten the cooking time. Gums are dispersed in water before mixing and making noodles dough.\n\nThe main ingredients in instant noodles are flour, starch, water, salt and/or a salt substitute known as \"kansui\", a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid.\n\nSpecific types of noodle can be made from a mix of wheat flour and other flour such as buckwheat. There are variations to the ingredients used depending on the country of origin in terms of the salt content and the flour content.\n\nNoodle production starts with dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water to form a mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left for a period of time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop gluten more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow-paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they are ready to be steamed for 1–5 minutes at to improve its texture by gelatinizing the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystallinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the starch granule and forms a gel matrix around the granule.\n\nNext, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1–2 minutes at a temperature of . The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30–50% to 2–5%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of canola, cottonseed and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30–40 minutes in hot air at a temperature of , resulting in a moisture content of 8–12%. During the drying process, the rapid evaporation of water creates pores throughout the food matrix, which allows for short cooking times in the finished product. In the case of fried noodles, the creation of pores is directly related to the uptake of fat into the noodles. More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15–20% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.\n\nBefore packaging with seasoning, the noodles are cooled after drying, and their quality of moisture, color, and shape are checked. Packaging of the noodles include films impermeable to air and water. There are two forms of packaged instant noodles, one in a bag with the provided seasoning in small sachets inside, or in a cup with seasoning on the top of the noodles. There are a variety of flavors to the noodles depending on which ones are added to the seasoning. Such flavors include beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, oriental, etc. In instant noodle cups, soy protein and dehydrated vegetables and meats are often added for further flavor.\n\nThe shelf life of instant noodles ranges from 4–12 months, depending on environmental factors. Their stability comes from the high sodium content with low moisture, and low water activity. Instant noodles can be served after 1–2 minutes in boiled water or soaked in hot water for 3–4 minutes.\n\nNoodles from instant ramen noodle soup are continuous viscoelastic gluten matrix evenly mixed with starch, which are wheat flour, water, kansui, and salt. After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll slitters. The conveying belt which transports noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of blades on the slitters; therefore, noodle dough sheet could be pressed multiple times up and down and produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, noodle dough sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of instant noodles.\n\nEven though dry instant noodles might not show any sign of elasticity, cooked instant noodles generally have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, which can give a unique springiness to the noodle strands. The wavy form of instant noodles is formed when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due to the difference between the velocity of conveying belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, and that creates the unique wavy form of instant noodles. During pressing by heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are broken during processing, which will make a more viscoelastic noodle dough and result in more elastic noodles. Furthermore, potato starch is a key ingredient in instant noodles, which has characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling. Therefore, the addition of starch could also increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increase the elasticity of noodle strands. Salt, dissolved in water as ions, could strengthen the interaction between gluten structures which can also increase the elasticity of noodles.\n\nThe initial purpose of inventing instant noodles was to shorten the cooking time of conventional noodles. Therefore, a short cooking time could be regarded as the most decisive characteristic of instant noodles. Instant noodles are cooked in boiled water; therefore, enhancing water retention is the major method to shorten cooking time.\n\nStarch gelatinization is the most important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, amyloses leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying. Moreover, as a common additive, guar gum can not only increase the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouth feel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.\n\nInstant noodles are often criticized as unhealthy or junk food.\nA single serving of instant noodles is high in carbohydrates and fat, but low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals.\n\nLead contamination in Nestlé's Maggi brand instant noodles made headlines in India, with some 7 times the allowed limit, with several Indian states banning the product as well as Nepal. On June 5, 2015, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them \"unsafe and hazardous\" for human consumption.\n\nInstant noodles are a popular food in many parts of the world, undergoing changes in flavor to fit local tastes. In 2015 the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA) noted 52 countries consumed 97.7 billion servings which China (and Hong Kong) consumed 40.43 billion and Indonesia consumed 13.20 billion servings, both countries dominated world instant noodle consumption by almost 55 percent.\n\nIn Argentina, instant noodles are gaining popularity and can be found in supermarkets in most major cities. The brand is usually Sapporo Ichiban. The Maruchan brand can also be found at Disco and Coto supermarkets. Due to the recent Chinese immigration wave, specialized Chinese supermarkets offer a wide variety of instant noodle brands.\n\nThe most popular manufacturer of instant noodle in Australia is San Remo Macaroni Company, whose Fantastic and Suimin brands hold a 30% market share. Other brands include Indomie, Indomie Mi Goreng, Maggi, Mr Lee's Noodles, Wai Wai, Nissin's Demae Ramen, and Nongshim's Shin ramyun served with broth. Instant noodles are often referred to as \"two-minute noodles\" in Australia, a reflection of their preparation time.\n\nMaggi is the most popular brand of instant noodle in Bangladesh. Instant noodles are a popular snack. They are often combined with eggs and seasonal vegetables.\n\nFor a long time, the main manufacturer of instant noodle was Nissin Miojo, to the extent that in Brazil the most common name for them is \"miojo\", which is a Nissin trademark. Manufacturers call them \"lámen\", from Japanese ramen. Many other companies, such as Maggi and Nestlé, also offer this product. There are many variants, such as \"Lámen Cremoso\", which has a creamy sauce, and \"Lámen Hot\", which includes pepper, as well as yakisoba and spaghetti.\n\nInstant noodles were first introduced into Canada at least as early as 1974 , with Ramen noodles as its Japanese originator. There are many brands available, including major brands from companies such as Nissin Foods, Sapporo Ichiban, Mr. Noodles, Nongshim, and Knorr. In some areas, these noodles are referred to simply by their brand names, though they are predominantly referred to as \"instant noodles\". These brand-name packages generally only contain one flavoring pouch. Some brands, mostly more expensive Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai brands, include more flavoring and separate packets for dried vegetables, flavoring contained in oil, and pepper, in addition to the soup stock. Korean brands such as Nongshim are readily available in most large grocery stores, and in some major cities, brands imported from Europe are also available.\n\nIn larger grocery stores and Asian markets in larger cities, a large variety of brands and international flavors can be found, including noodles from such places as Thailand, Indonesia, and India. Instant noodles from Grace, a Caribbean food company, are available in some places. Due to the large South Asian population in some major cities, Maggi is also a popular brand. Product formats include regular plastic wrapping and in various foam food containers.\n\nThe market is focusing on higher-end products. The top three brands in this category dominate more than 85% of the market; for the lower end, the leading five brands hold about 60% of the market share. The dominant brands in the Chinese market are:\n\nIn 2014, instant noodles sales declined by 9.1 percent year-on-year, due to some lower-income migrant workers shifting to higher-quality instant noodles from Korea, while Chinese instant noodle companies lured consumers with cheaper instant noodles. 40 billion packets of instant noodles are sold annually in China, which makes up about half the world's annual consumption of instant noodles.\n\nInstant noodles were introduced in 2010 by Nissin Foods of Japan. On September 13, 2013; Nissin Foods opened its commercial office in Bogotá, investing US$ 6 million in its corporate offices.\n\nVirtually all supermarkets sell instant noodles of some sort, but they tend to be Westernized and come in foam containers, costing upwards of 5 kroner. Ethnic stores and specialty shops offer the most popular alternative, Yum Yum, whose prices range from 3–4 kroner; \"3 for 10\" offers are nearly universal. Its popularity has been sufficient to become a generic brand name. Mama, another brand from Thailand, is the second most popular Eastern brand but has a much smaller market share. Wai Wai, a brand from Nepal, is also available. Most Danish supermarket instant noodles contain Monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a flavor enhancer.\n\nInstant soups have a long tradition in Germany, back to the 19th century, with, for example, the inventions of Justus von Liebig, or Maggi products. Instant noodles as discussed here, however, were relatively unknown in Germany until the 1990s, but they have since continually gained in popularity.\n\nThere are two types of ramen in Germany: the first, generally called \"Instant-Nudeln\" (instant noodles), tend to be a mild, Westernized version and come in flavors such as chicken, vegetable, beef and button mushroom. The second type is called \"Ramen\" and is quite similar to instant noodles as they are known in Asia. German \"Ramen\" was originally considered an ethnic food and was only available in specialty stores. Since the mid-1990s, it has become available at German supermarkets. The most popular brands are \"Yum Yum\", Thai Chef, Nissin Cup Noodles, and Maggi.\n\nCantonese people have a long history of cooking yi mein, a noodle invented in the Qing Dynasty. However, modern instant noodles were only publicly introduced to Hong Kong in the late 1960s by Winner Food Products Ltd as \"Doll Noodles\" (). It was named \"Doll Noodles\" because the logo is designed in the shape of a doll in Cantonese (). Although the company was bought out by Nissin in 1984 and other brands from many different countries have become widely available, the name \"Doll Noodles\" remains ubiquitous and has since become a synonym for instant noodles, irrespective of brands. It is usually taken as a derogatory term for poor, busy and/or unhealthy lifestyles, as these noodles have become a part of daily life in Hong Kong.\n\nMost supermarkets offer a vast choice of both domestic and international brands, including Shin Ramyun of South Korea, Nissin Chikin and Demae Itcho of Japan, Indomie of Indonesia, Koka of Singapore and Mama of Thailand. Besides instant wheat noodles, supermarkets also sell instant rice noodles and Cantonese egg noodles. Premium instant noodles can also be found. Some of them are priced at more than HK$20 a pack.\n\nSome noodles are also marketed as a snack which need not to be cooked; consumers ingest the noodles directly out of the packaging similar to crisps. The most common brand for this is Fuku and Baby Star.\n\nHungary is 43rd in the world in the consumption of instant noodles according to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), having consumed 20 million packages/cups of noodles in 2014.\n\nThai President Foods, manufacturer of MAMA noodles, opened an instant noodles factory in Hungary in 2013. The Hungarian factory's two production lines have a capacity of 4.5 million noodle packs per shift per month. It produces \"Thai Chef\" and \"Asia Gold\" brand noodles for the European market.\n\nIn 2016, India was the fourth largest consumer of instant noodles after Japan, Indonesia and China. India is also the most attractive instant noodles market in the world.\n\nOn June 5, 2015, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them \"unsafe and hazardous\" for human consumption. Although in November 2015, Maggi instant noodles made a return in the Indian market after the ban was lifted.\n\nIndia is Nestle Maggi's largest market. Other brands include instant noodles from Patanjali Ayurved, Ching's Secret, Knorr, Sunfeast Yippee, Top Ramen, Indomie, Joymee, Nissin, Horlicks, Wai Wai and several domestic and regional brands.\n\nAn early instant noodle in Indonesia was \"Supermi\", introduced in the 1970s by Indofood Sukses Makmur, the largest instant noodle producer in the world. It later introduced two additional brands – \"Indomie\" and \"Sarimi\".\n\nCurrently, Indofood Sukses Makmur has a market share of about 70% of Indonesian instant noodle production. In 1999, the figure was about 90%; their market share declined following the introduction of \"Mie Sedaap\" by Wings Food in 2003. Strong local preferences contribute to the low volume of sales of Japanese and other foreign instant noodles in Indonesia. However, spicy Korean noodles appeal to the locals and are gaining traction in the market.\n\nIndonesians generally prefer noodles with strong flavors. Popular flavors include Chicken curry, Onion and Chicken, Bakso (beef meatball), Mie Goreng and Chicken Soto, a traditional Indonesian chicken soup. In the past, Indomie tried to produce 30 different flavors to reflect various traditional dishes of Indonesian cuisine, but the product line was discontinued after disappointing results with only several popular variants remain in production. \n\nIndonesians usually add ingredients such as simple boiled Chinese green cabbage, boiled or fried egg, corned beef, bottled sambal chili sauce, pepper or fried shallots to their meals.\n\nMost of the market share is owned by the product Indomie Mi goreng, A dry instant noodle meant to replicate the traditional Indonesian dish Mie goreng, or fried noodles. Other variants of popular instant noodles in Indonesia includes Mie Gelas, which is sized so it could be served in a drinking glass, and Pop Mie, which is similar to Cup Noodles.\n\nAlthough originally targeted for family at home; nowadays, instant noodles are also served in \"warung\" (simple shop). These shops serving instant noodles are customarily called \"warung indomie\", despite the fact that the brand of instant noodles served there are not necessarily Indomie. \n\nA non-exhaustive list of Indonesian instant noodle brands:\n\nJapan is the country of origin of instant noodles. Instant noodles remain a \"national\" light food. The average Japanese person eats 40 packs of instant noodles per year.\n\nAfter their invention by Momofuku Andō in 1958 (\"shōyu\" (Soy sauce) flavor), instant noodles became very common in Japan. In the 1970s, makers expanded their flavors to include such examples as \"shio\" (salt), \"miso\", or curry. Beginning in the 1980s, makers also added dried toppings such as shrimp, pork, or eggs. Today, instant noodles are divided into two groups: \"traditional\" cheap (¥100 to ¥200) noodles with few toppings and expensive (¥200 to ¥350) noodles with many toppings, which are often packed into a pouch. Various kinds of instant noodles are produced, including ramen, udon, soba, yakisoba, and pasta.\n\nMajor makers in Japan are:\n\nRamyeon (), often translated as instant noodles, is a Korean instant noodle dish made by boiling a precooked and dried noodle block with flavoring powder or sauce. The stereotype of a South Korea \"ramyeon\" is red and spicy, with or without common toppings such as egg, chopped scallions and chili peppers. Best selling \"ramyeon\" in 2016 include Shin Ramyun (Nongshim), Jin Ramen (Ottogi), Ansungtangmyun (Nongshim), Samyang ramen (Samyang Food), and Neoguri (Nongshim).\n\nThe word \"ramyeon\" () derived from the Chinese \"lāmiàn\" () or \"lǎomiàn\" (). \"Ramyeon\" is not considered to be a Sino-Korean word.\n\nRamyeon is very popular in South Korea, with nearly every convenience store selling some type of ramyeon. Due to the ease of preparation and low cost, ramyeon is often eaten by college students, campers, and low-income households.\n\nThe first instant ramyeon in South Korea was introduced by Samyang Food in 1963 with technical assistance from Myojo Foods Co. Japan, which provided manufacturing equipment. The Lotte Food Industrial Company (currently named Nongshim) invigorated the Korean ramyeon market in 1965.\n\nSince the 2010s, Korean stores and restaurants have spread over the whole world. Baguio City has several Korean restaurants serving Ramyeon.\n\nIn South Korea, instant noodles are more common than non-instant noodles; the word \"ramyeon\" (), generally means the instant kind. Japanese Ramen is often referred to as \"Japanese ramyeon\" or \"Japanese noodles\". Lot of South Korean food stalls make instant ramyeon and add toppings or other main ingredients for their customers.\n\nRamyeon is typically spicy and salty. Shin Ramyun (신[辛], literally \"spicy\") is the best-selling brand in South Korea. It has also become popular in China and the United States. The leading manufacturer of ramyeon in South Korea is Nong Shim ([農心], literally \"Farmer's Heart\"), which exports many of its products overseas.\n\nIn 2004, over 600,000 boxes of Shin brand Ramyeon were sent to North Korea as part of the aid relief program when the Ryongchŏn train station exploded, injuring many North Koreans. Insider sources have said that most of it was sold in North Korean black markets, making its way to Pyongyang, instead of being distributed as aid. North Korean visitors to China also frequently purchase South Korean ramyeon from Chinese stores, where Shin Ramyeon is known as \"Korean Tangmi Ramyeon.\"\n\nIndigenous production of Ramyeon in North Korea began in 2000. The first Ramyeon brand was \"kkoburang guksu,\" which literally means \"curly noodles\" in Korean. Later, a joint venture by North Korean and Hong Kong-based companies began producing \"jŭksŏk guksu,\" () which literally means \"instant noodles.\" Ramyŏn is popular among North Korean elites who live in Pyongyang and Nampo. In contrast to hot and spicy South Korean Ramyeon, North Korean Ramyŏn has a much milder and brothier flavor.\n\nCommon types of Ramyeon are:\n\nA partial list of ramyeon brands:\n\nMaggi has practically become synonymous with instant noodles. In many places, all instant noodles are referred to as \"maggi,\" regardless of the brand. Popular flavors include curry, chicken, tom yum, and asam laksa. Both soup-based and dry variants are available. Indomie, Nissin, Cintan and Mamee brands of instant noodles are also well loved by Malaysians, Singaporeans and Bruneians.\n\nThough instant noodles are usually eaten at home, they are also very popular as restaurant or cafe meals, especially in Mamak shops similar to Hong Kong's \"cha chaan teng\" cafes. These noodles are usually stir fried with egg and fish cake, using a minimum amount of monosodium glutamate.\n\nIn recent years, instant noodle manufacturers have tried to introduce low-MSG seasonings, as well as new processes that do not require frying for the noodles, and have introduced new flavors such as chilli crab and seafood.\n\nApollo (brand name) noodles are popular in Mauritius. Popular flavors include shrimp, curry, chicken and vegetable. This Mauritian brand is today also widely available in some Western markets such as France. \n\nPresto (brand name) is a brand of instant noodles produced by HV Industries Ltd.

This kind of soup was introduced in the 1980s by the Maggi Corporation as \"Instant Maggi Ramen\", marketed in a small plastic bag with artificial flavors, but it did not become popular until cup noodles were introduced in 1990 by Maruchan. Due to this popularity, the instant noodles are often referred to simply as \"Maruchan\". Today, many local brands such as \"La Moderna\" and \"Herdez\" have developed their own cup noodles, along Nissin, which is also a newcomer. In the early 2000s, Maggi introduced four instant noodles flavors, like tomato pasta or chicken with green tomatoes, but they were soon discontinued.\n\nInstant noodles are famous in Nepal. In the early 1980s, Gandaki Noodles (P.) Ltd. of Pokhara city, introduced Rara, a white instant noodles named after the largest lake of Nepal. It was a fair success among urban population. Then in around 1985, Chaudhary Groups(CG) entered the market with Wai Wai. Wai-Wai noodles, a brown, spicy and precooked noodle, became a big hit among the people. Over the years, its popularity has grown heavily and consist of a major part of the dry foods sold in Nepal and are available in any part of the country. The Quality control office of Nepal withheld Nepal quality marks for wai wai in 2012.\n\nVarious brands of instant noodle from Australia like Maggi, Trident, and Fantastic are sold through both ethnic outlets and mainstream super-hypermarkets, including Yum Yum and Indomie Mi Goreng\n\nSince its introduction in 1988, Indomie is the most popular instant noodle brand in Nigeria. Instant noodle brands are now eaten in most households across the country. By 2008, nine other brands of noodle had appeared on the market. Affirming Indomie's hold on the market, Christopher Ezendu, a distributor at the popular Oke-Arin market on Lagos Island, reported that these other brands are aspiring to be like the market leader. In 2013 a wholly owned and managed Nigerian company based in Abuja, Royal Mills and Foods limited, launched a new brand of instant noodle, De-Royal Instant Noodles with two flavors (chicken and onion chicken), in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the World Instant Noodle Association, Nigeria was the 13th largest consumer of instant noodle in the world in 2007.\n\nInstant noodle is not a traditional part of Pakistani cuisine, but it showed rapid growth over the review period and became very popular because it is easy to prepare within minutes. Due to the busy lives of urban consumers, they prefer a quick and convenient meal which was provided by noodles. It continued to become popular among children and the younger generation as a mini meal with many flavors such as masala and chicken. There are three challenging brands of instant noodles in Pakistan. Nestlé's Maggi which was the first brand to enter market in 1992, followed by Knorr of Unilever in 1993 and in 2012 Shan Food Industries introduced \"Shoop\".

Popular variations include spicy, soy-sauce-calamansi, and sweet-spicy.\n\nInstant noodles began appearing on Polish store shelves during the early 1990s. Despite being called \"Chinese soup\", the first brands on the market were produced in Vietnam and had a somewhat spicy, garlic-flavored taste. The noodle packages contained pouches of flavored soup base, spicy oil, dried vegetables or even minuscule shrimps.\n\nThe product gained particular popularity among students due to its affordability and convenience. \"Kaczka łagodna\" (\"Mild duck\"), \"Kurczakowa łagodna\" (\"Mild chicken\") and \"Krewetkowa ostra\" (\"Spicy shrimp\") were the most common flavors. Today, the local Kim Lan and worldwide Knorr brands offer varieties ranging from cheese-and-herb flavored noodles to local Polish specialties like barszcz czerwony or żurek.\n\nNgoc Tu Tao, who emigrated to Poland from Vietnam and established the Tan-Viet Group in 1990, is credited with introducing the instant noodle to Poland. His VIFON brand holds a 35% share of the Polish instant soup market, selling over 100 million packages a year. Ngoc Tu Tao has appeared in \"Wprost\" magazine's annual ranking of the 100 most wealthy Polish citizens.\n\nInexpensive supermarket private-label brands and regular mid-market products do not differ much in taste, while their prices can range from PLN 0.8 to PLN 2.00.

Instant noodles have been popular in Russia's Far East region since the late 1980s and made their way west in the early 1990s. In Russia, like most noodle products, they are still considered a lesser-quality option to turn to in lean economic times. They are popular among college students and homeless as a regular meal.\n\nSince its introduction to Saudi Arabia, the brand \"اندومي\" (Indomie) dominated the market; currently the brand \"تويا\" (Toya) is popular. Instant noodles are popular among children and young adults. However, it is not usually served as a meal in households.\n\nInstant noodles have become commonplace in South Africa since the 1990s, when they were first introduced to the general consumer market. While various brands are available, the most common is Maggi 2 Minute Noodles. Because of their low cost, instant noodles are popular in South Africa's poorer communities. They are also popular among students and office workers as a quick snack.

According to statistics from the International Ramen Manufacturers Association, Taiwan is the world's 12th largest instant noodle market, with an annual NT$10 billion (US$300 million) in sales. This translates into an annual total of 900 million packs, or 40 per person. Uni-President (aka President or Tong-Yi, 統一) takes the largest market share of instant noodles in the country, and is a major player in the global instant noodle market.\n\nMajor makers in Taiwan are:\n\n\"MAMA\" () brand noodles is the leader of Thailand's instant-noodle industry. MAMA got its start in 1972 as a joint venture between Taiwan's President Enterprise and Thailand's Saha Pathanapibul PLC. In 2016, there are three well-known brands of instant noodles, \"Yum Yum\", \"Wai Wai\", and \"MAMA\". \"MAMA\" controls about half the market. Tom Yum Shrimp is the best selling flavor. Thais call instant noodles \"Mama\", now a generic term in Thailand. Thais consume an average of 45 packs of noodles per person per year, fourth in the world after Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n\nDue to their ubiquity, instant noodles were chosen as a vehicle for dietary fortification by a joint effort of the Federation of Thai Industries, instant noodle producers, and the Ministry of Public Health about 10 years ago. The vitamins and minerals added are iron, iodine, and vitamin A.\n\nUnlike Japanese or Malaysian instant noodles, Mama noodles are often used to cook different dishes using only the noodles, leaving out the seasoning. The typical method of cooking is by adding boiled water, but Thais typically add meat, pork, chicken or egg to spice up the instant noodles. Sometimes they will cook the noodles and combine the noodles in a dish called a noodle salad known as \"yum Mama\". This dish is often prepared with meat balls, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Another method is to stir fry the cooked noodles with pork, chicken, eggs, and vegetables to give the noodles extra flavor. They are also sometimes consumed directly as a snack without further cooking by crushing the noodles in the packet, adding seasoning powder in the packet and shaking the packet to coat the crushed dried noodles evenly with the seasoning. Instant noodle products have become successful in Thailand, because they are cheap, easy to eat, can be easily found, and offer a range of flavors. Recently some brands of instant noodles include real dehydrated meat such as pork or beef. The average retail price is about six baht for the regular size and 10 baht for Yum Yum Jumbo packs.\n\nFor years, sales of MAMA noodles was considered a barometer of the Thai economy, with consumption rising when times were lean. This has not been the case recently. In 2014, when the political crisis slowed Thailand's economic growth to 0.9 percent and eventually led to a military coup, the growth of MAMA noodle sales hit a low of one percent. In 2015, when the military government could not lift the country beyond an estimated 2.8 percent growth, sales of MAMA noodles only grew 0.4 percent—a record low. Saha Pathanapibul's vice-president, Vathit Chokwatana, attributed the poor sales to falling commodity prices, which have weakened the purchasing power of rural people.\n\nVarious brands of instant noodle are sold through both \"toko\" and non-specialty supermarkets, including Saimin, Indomie Mi Goreng, Maggi, Thai varieties such as Mama and Yum Yum, and some more Western alternatives, such as Conimex and Good Noodles by Unox. Both cup and packet varieties are available.\n\nInstant noodles have been quite popular in Ukraine in the past 10 years because they are cheap and can save time. Mivina noodles can be cooked as soup or eaten dry; dry instant noodles are as popular in Ukraine as potato chips and croutons. Mivina is rivaled by the Russian Rollton, which also produces instant noodles for quick soups.\n\nUAE is one of the most attractive Instant Noodles market in the world. The most significant brand in UAE is Maggi, with the flavour likes biryani, curry, cheese and chicken. Apart from Maggi, other brand also available on the market like Panzani, Barilla, Indomie and Yupi.\n\nA common form of instant noodles in Britain is Pot Noodle, a cup noodle first marketed by Golden Wonder in the late 1970s, and acquired by Unilever in 1995. These use artificial flavorings and are generally suitable for vegetarians (there is no chicken in Chicken Pot Noodles, for example) and are sold by virtually every major supermarket chain, general groceries shops, and convenience stores. \n\nPacket noodles such as Batchelors' Super Noodles are also sold. Several of the larger supermarkets sell eastern brands such as Nissin, Koka noodles and Shin Ramyun, which once could only be found in Asian groceries. Larger retail chains may offer their own brand in basic packaging and a variety of flavors, e.g. Asda, while noodles such as Maggi can also be found in many groceries, but are less widespread. Kabuto Noodles, launched in 2010, was the UKs first up-market instant noodle brand followed by Itsu and Mr Lee's Noodles.\n\nIn the United States, instant noodles were first available by Nissin Foods in 1971. In 1972, Nissin Foods introduced \"Nissin Cup Noodles\" in a foam food cup, which led to an upsurge in popularity. Soon after, many other competing companies were offering similar instant noodle products.\n\nToday, in the U.S., the instant noodle is commonly known as \"ramen\", after the Japanese dish on which it was originally based, and it comes in a variety of mostly meat-based flavors such as beef, chicken and shrimp. Some prominent brands are Nissin Foods brand Top Ramen (originally Top Ramen's Oodles of Noodles), Maruchan Ramen, and Sapporo Ichiban. A wide range of popular brands imported from other countries are available at many Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets. Instant ramen noodles are extremely popular among students and other people of low income, due to their ease of preparation and unusually low cost. With Top Ramen brand, Shrimp is pink, Oriental is blue – though now it's called \"Soy Sauce.\" A new brighter logo helps emphasize the two vegetarian flavors: Soy Sauce and Chili. While price varies throughout the U.S., generally several packages can be purchased for 25 cents or less.\n\nIn the prison system, ramen packets have become a form of currency, comprising a mainstay of the informal economy there.\n\nInstant noodles are popular in Vietnam, where they are often eaten as a breakfast food. Both wheat and rice noodles are common. Acecook Vietnam, Masan Food and AsiaFoods are leading producers of instant noodles. Popular Vietnamese instant noodle soups include Oriental, \"bánh đa cua\", \"bún bò Huế\"-flavored, phở, and \"hủ tiếu Nam Vang\", a Phnom Penh-style noodle.\n\n"}
{"id": "30876766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30876766", "title": "Cue stick", "text": "Cue stick\n\nA cue stick (or simply cue, more specifically billiards cue, pool cue, or snooker cue), is an item of sporting equipment essential to the games of pool, snooker and carom billiards. It is used to strike a ball, usually the . Cues are tapered sticks, typically about 57–59 inches (about 1.5 m) long and usually between 16 and 21 ounces (450–600 g), with professionals gravitating toward a 19-ounce (540 g) average. Cues for carom tend toward the shorter range, though cue length is primarily a factor of player height and arm length. Most cues are made of wood, but occasionally the wood is covered or bonded with other materials including graphite, carbon fiber or fiberglass. An obsolete term for a cue, used from the 16th to early 19th centuries, is billiard stick.\n\nThe forerunner of the cue was the , an implement similar to a light-weight golf club, with a foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball. When the ball was against a , use of the mace was difficult (the foot would not fit under the edge of the cushion to strike the ball squarely), and by 1670 experienced players often used the tail or butt end of the mace instead. The term \"cue\" comes from \"queue\", the French word for \"tail\", in reference to this practice, a style of shooting that eventually led to the development of separate, footless cue sticks by about 1800, used initially as adjuncts to the mace, which remained in use until well into the 19th century. In public billiard rooms only skilled players were allowed to use the cue, because the fragile cloth could be torn by novices. The introduction of the cue, and the new game possibilities it engendered, led to the development of cushions with more rebound, initially stuffed with linen or cotton flocking, but eventually replaced by rubber.\n\nThe idea of the cue initially was to try to strike the cue-ball as centrally as possible to avoid a . The concept of on the cue ball was discovered before cue-tips had been invented; e.g. striking the bottom of the cue ball to make it go backwards upon contact with an . François Mingaud was studying the game of billiards while being held in Paris as a political prisoner, and experimented with a leather cue tip. In 1807, he was released and demonstrated his invention. Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically, to the position adopted by the mace, he could perform what is now known as a shot.\n\nIn pre-tip days, it was common for players to twist the ends of their cue into a plaster wall or ceiling so that a chalk-like deposit would form on the end to reduce the chance of a miscue, thus giving rise to the modern . The first systematic marketing of chalk was by John Carr, a marker in John Bartley's billiard rooms in Bath. Between Carr and Bartley, it was discovered how \"\" () could be used to the advantage of players, and Carr began selling chalk in small boxes. He called it \"twisting powder\", and the magical impression this gave the public enabled him to sell it for a higher price than if they realized it was simply chalk in a small box. \"\", an American term for sidespin, derives from the British discovery of sidespin's effects, as \"massé\" comes from the French word for \"mace\".\n\nPool and snooker cues average around in length and are of three major types. The simplest type is a one-piece cue; these are generally stocked in pool halls for communal use. They have a uniform taper, meaning they decrease in diameter evenly from the end or butt to the tip. A second type is the two-piece cue, divided in the middle for ease of transport, usually in a cue case or pouch. A third variety is another two-piece cue, but with a joint located three-quarters down the cue (usually 12 or 16 inches away from the butt), known as a \"three-quarter two-piece\", used by snooker players.\n\nA typical two piece cue for pocket billiards is usually made mostly of hard or rock maple, with a fiberglass or phenolic resin , usually long, and steel and . Pool cues average around long, are commonly available in weights, with being the most common, and usually have a diameter in the range of 12 to 14 mm. A conical , with the gradually shrinking in diameter from joint to ferrule, is favored by some, but the \"pro\" taper is increasingly popular, straight for most of the length of the shaft from ferrule back, flaring to joint diameter only in the last to of the shaft. While there are many custom cuemakers, a very large number of quality pool cues are manufactured in bulk. In recent years, modern materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, aluminum, etc., have been used more and more for shafts and butts. A trend toward experimentation has also developed with rubber, memory foam and other soft .\n\nCarom billiards cues tend to be shorter and lighter than pool cues, with a shorter ferrule, a thicker and joint, a wooden joint pin (ideally) and collarless wood-to-wood joint, a conical taper, and a smaller tip diameter. Typical dimensions are long, in weight, with an 11–12 mm diameter tip. The specialization makes the cue stiffer, for handling the heavier billiard balls and acting to reduce . The wood used in carom cues can vary widely, and most quality carom cues are handmade.\n\nAt , a cue designed for snooker is usually shorter than the typical 59 inch pool cue and has detachable butt for making the cue longer or more. Many snooker cues are jointed, usually with brass fittings, or even of the way back toward the butt , providing an unusually long shaft, rather than at the half-way point, where pool and carom cues are jointed. This necessitates an extra long cue case. Some models are jointed in two places, with the long shaft having a smooth and subtle wood-to-wood joint. Snooker cue tips are usually 8.5 – 10.5 mm in diameter to provide more accuracy and finesse with snooker balls, which are smaller than pool and carom varieties. Snooker butts are usually flat on one side so that the cue may be lain flat on the table and slid along the baize under a to strike the cushion-ward side of the when it is to the cushion (such a shot is not legal in pool or carom games under most rulesets). This tactile flat part of the butt also helps the player develop a very specific way of holding the cue, consistent on every shot for a very uniform (snooker, in the case of many if not most shots, requires much more precision than pool). Snooker cue weights vary between 16 and 18 oz. While a lighter cue is usually for beginners to develop correct technique when starting out, some professional snooker players use lighter cues (15 - 16 1/2 oz.), Joe Davis, John Spencer, Terry Griffiths, Mark Williams and Paul Hunter, to name a few. The balance point of a cue is usually 16 to 18 inches from the butt end.\n\nManufacturers also provide a variety of specialty cues tailored to specific shots. Pool \"break cues\" have tips made from very hard leather (sometimes layered) or phenolic resin to ensure that the full force of the stroke is transferred to the cue ball during the , and to avoid excessive wear-and-tear on the tips and ferrules of players' main shooting cues. Phenolic-tipped break cues often have a merged phenolic ferrule-tip, instead of two separate pieces.\n\n\"Jump cues\" are shorter, lighter (12 ounces and less) cues that make performing a legal easier, and also often have a very hard tip. Some standard-sized break cues include a two-piece butt allowing a player to remove the lower, heavier half of the butt to produce a jump cue; these are usually referred to as \"jump–break\" or \"break–jump cues\". The uncommon \"massé cue\" is short and heavy, with a wider tip to aid in making .\n\nPractitioners of artistic billiards and artistic pool sometimes have twenty or more cues, each specifically tailored to a particular trick shot. Other specialty cues have multiple sections, between which weights can be added. Another specialization is the butt extension, which can be slipped over or screwed into the normal butt, to lengthen the cue and reduce dependency on the .\n\nA high quality two-piece cue with a nearly invisible wood-to-wood , so that it looks like a cheap one-piece , is called a \"\". Such a cue may be used by a hustler to temporarily fool unsuspecting gamblers into thinking that he or she is a novice.\n\nShafts are made with various tapers, the two most common being the pro taper and the European taper. The pro taper has the same diameter from the tip to 30–35 cm (12–14 inches) toward the joint, at which point it begins to widen. The European taper widens continually and smoothly from the ferrule toward the joint. Despite their names, the continually sloping European taper is found in most North American bar and house cues, and not all professional players prefer a straight pro taper on their custom, two-piece models. It is possible to ruin a cue by sanding alone. Instead of rock wool, use ultra fine sandpaper.\n\nLeather tips of varying curvature and degrees of hardness are glued to (or in some cases screwed into) the ferrule. The \"de facto\" standard curvatures for a pool tip are dime- and nickel-radius, determined by shaping a tip so that when one puts a nickel or dime to it, they have the same curvature. The tip end of the cue will vary in diameter but is typically in the 9 to 14 millimeter range with 12–13 mm for pool cues, and 9–10 mm for Snooker cues being most common.\n\nRounder (i.e., smaller radius) tips impart to the cue ball more easily since the point of contact between the tip and the ball requires less distance from the center hit to impart the same amount of spin, due to the increased tangential contact. Tips for break and jump cues are usually nickel radius or even flatter, and sometimes made of harder materials such as phenolic resin; the shots are forceful, and usually require less spin.\n\nA leather tip naturally compresses and hardens with subsequent shots. Without proper care, the surface of the tip can develop an undesired smoothness or glossiness which can significantly reduce the desired friction between the tip and the cue ball. Cue chalk is applied to the tip of the cue, ideally after every other shot or so, to help achieve the desired friction and minimize the chance of a . This is especially important when the cue tip does not hit the cue ball in its center and thereby imparts spin to the cue ball.\n\nThere are different grades of hardness for tips, ranging from very soft to very hard. Softer tips (major brands include Elk Master and Blue Diamond) hold chalk better, but tend to degrade faster from abrasion (from chalk and scuffers), shaping (from cue tip shapers/tackers/picks), and mushrooming (the sides of the tip bulge out from long normal use or from hard hits that compact the tip in all directions). Harder tips (major brands include Blue Diamond Plus, Triangle and Le Professional or \"Le Pro\") maintain their shape much better, but because of their hardness, chalk tends to not hold as well as it does on softer tips. The hardness of a leather tip is determined from its compression and tanning during the manufacturing process.\n\nAll cue tips once were of a one-piece construction, as are many today (including LePro and Triangle). More recently some tips are made of layers that are laminated together (major brands include kamui, Moori and Talisman). Harder tips and laminated tips hold their shape better than softer tips and one-piece tips. Laminated tips generally cost more than one-piece tips due to their more extensive manufacturing process. A potential problem with layered tips is delamination, where a layer begins to separate from another or the tip completely comes apart. This is not common and usually results from improper installation, misuse of tip tools, or high impact massé shots. One-piece tips are not subject to this problem, but they do tend to mushroom more easily.\n\nThese days there are synthetic, \"\"-leather or even rubber cue tips available that have similar playing characteristics to animal-hide tips. Often these are less affected by moisture and humidity than leather tips, tend less to bulge and mis-shapen, and are suitable substitutes for the average player.\n\nThe end of the shaft has a cuff known as the ferrule, which is used to hold the cue tip in place and to bear the brunt of impact with the cue ball so that the less resilient shaft wood does not split. Ferrules are no longer made of ivory, but, rather, are now made of carbon fiber, or a plastic such as melamine resin, or phenolic resin, which are extremely durable, high-impact materials that are resistant to cracking, chipping, and breaking. Brass ferrules are sometimes used, especially for snooker cues.\n\nThe heavy, lower piece of the cue is the cue butt, and the smaller, narrower end is the shaft. The two cue pieces are attached at the joint; normally a screw rising from butt end's joint (male) is threaded into a receptacle on the shaft (female), or vice versa. The joints are made of various materials, most frequently a plastic, brass, stainless steel, or wood outer layer, but some custom cues are made of bone, antlers, or other more expensive materials that are less common, but serve the same effect. Most snooker cues have brass-to-brass joints. The internal male and female connection points are almost always brass or steel because they respond less to temperature changes and thus expand and contract less than other materials, preserving the life of the cue. Joints have different sizes as well as different male and female ends on the shaft and butts of the cues. Traditional designs employ a fully threaded connection, while newer versions (marketed under such names as Uni-loc, Accu-loc, Speed-loc, and Tru-loc) employ half-threaded \"quick pin release\" connections that allow players to assemble and disassemble their cues faster.\n\nThe bulk of the weight of the cue is usually distributed in the cue butt portion. Whether the weight be 16 oz. or 22 oz., the weight change is mainly in the butt (usually in the core, under the wrap). Butts have varying constructions, from three-piece to one-piece, as well as other custom versions that people have developed. These translate into different \"feels\" because of the distribution of weight as well as the balance point of the cue. Traditionally, players want the balance point of a cue near the top end of the wrap or around 7 inches from where they grip the butt. Some brands, and most custom cuemakers offer weights, usually metal discs of 1 to 2 ounces, that can be added at one or more places to adjust the balance and total weight and feel of the cue.\n\nThe cue butt is often inlaid with exotic woods such as cocobolo and bocote as well as other materials such as ebony and mother of pearl. Usually parts of the butt are sectioned off with decorative rings. The use of various types of wraps on the cue butt, such as Irish linen or leather, provide a player with a better grip as well as absorbing moisture. Low-priced cues usually feature a nylon wrap which is considered not as good a \"feel\" as Irish Linen. Fiberglass and Graphite cues usually have a \"Veltex\" grip that is made of fiberglass/graphite, but is smoother and not glossy. Some people also prefer a cue with no wrap, and thus just a glossed finish on wood. Sometimes these no-wrap cues are more decorated because of the increased area for design and imagination. The butts of less expensive cues are usually spliced hardwood and a plastic covering while more high-end cues use solid rosewood or ebony. Snooker cues might be just the wood, waxed or oiled (bees wax, linseed oil).\n\nThe final part a cue is the bumper, made of rubber (pool) or leather (snooker). Though often considered less important than other parts of a cue, this part is essential for protecting a cue. The bumper protects the cue when it rests on the ground or accidentally hits a wall, table, etc. Without the bumper, such impacts might crack the butt over an extended period of time. The \"feel\" of the cue \"(see below)\" is also an issue – without the bumper, the resonance of the cue hitting the cue ball may vibrate differently than in a cue with a properly attached, tight bumper. Though small, the bumper also adds some weight on the end of the cue, preserving a balance that also impacts the feel of a cue.\n\nA cue can be either hand- or machine-spliced. The choice of materials used in the construction of the cue butt and the artistry of the design can lead to cues of great beauty and high price. Good quality pool cues are customarily made from straight-grained hard rock maple wood, especially the shaft. Snooker cues, by contrast, are almost always made of ash wood, although one might come across one with a maple shaft. Maple is stiffer than ash, and cheaper. Cues are not always for play, some are purely collectible and can reach prices of tens of thousands of dollars for the materials they are made of and their exquisite craftsmanship.\n\nA good cue needn't be expensive. These \"collector\" cues have fine workmanship and use top quality materials. They are designed with ornate inlays in varying types of wood, precious metals and stones, all in a multitude of styles and sometimes displaying works of art. The inlays are stained, translucent, transparent or painted. These cues are also valued because of how well they perform. Competitors of custom cue makers and mass-production manufacturers usually try to make cues look like they are made of expensive materials by using overlays and decals. Although these lower the cost of the cues, they do not degrade the cues' effectiveness in game play. Another mark of quality is the precision with which inlays are set. High quality inlays fit perfectly with no gaps; they are symmetrical on all sides, as well as cut cleanly so that all edges and points are sharp, not rounded. The use of machines has aided much in the production of high quality inlays and other ornaments.\n\nThere have been a number of cue makers over the years; among them are George Balabushka, Herman Rambow, John Parris (Church Vale, London), Hunt & O'Byrne (Butler's Wharf, London), Palmer, Longoni, Samsara, Southwest, Szamboti, and Tascarella, whose cues are often very valuable to collectors.\n"}

In the absence of tagliatelle, it can also be used with other broad, flat pasta shapes, such as pappardelle or fettuccine. Genuine \"ragù alla bolognese\" is a slowly cooked sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato concentrate or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce.\n\nThe earliest documented recipe of an Italian meat-based sauce (\"ragù\") served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna. A recipe for a meat sauce for pasta that is specifically described as being \"bolognese\" appeared in Pellegrino Artusi's cookbook of 1891. The \"ragù alla bolognese\" that is now traditionally associated with tagliatelle and lasagne is somewhat different from Artusi's recipe. Many traditional variations currently exist. In 1982 the Italian Academy of Cuisine registered a recipe for authentic \"ragù alla bolognese\" with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce (incorporating some fresh pancetta and a little milk). In Italy, \"ragù alla bolognese\" is often referred to simply as \"ragù\".\n\nOutside Italy, the phrase \"Bolognese sauce\" often refers to a tomato-based sauce to which minced beef (or pork) has been added; such sauces typically bear less resemblance to \"ragù alla bolognese\" being more similar in fact to the \"ragù alla napoletana\" from the tomato-rich south of the country. Whereas in Italy \"ragù\" is not used with spaghetti, so-called \"spaghetti bolognese\" has become a popular dish in many other parts of the world.\n\nThe earliest documented recipe for a meat-based sauce (\"ragù\") served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna. Pellegrino Artusi published a recipe for a meat sauce characterized as being \"bolognese\" in his cookbook published in 1891. Artusi's recipe, which he called \"Maccheroni alla bolognese\", is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (\"maccheroni\" being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe only partially resembles the ragù alla bolognese that is traditionally associated with tagliatelle. The sauce called for predominantly lean veal filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with butter until the meats browned, then covered and cooked with broth. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of truffle, or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta (\"horse teeth\") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was firm, and then flavored with the sauce and Parmigiano cheese.\n\nIn the century-plus since Artusi recorded and subsequently published his recipe for \"Maccheroni alla bolognese\", what is now \"ragù alla bolognese\" has evolved with the cuisine of the region. Most notable is the preferred choice of pasta, which today is widely recognized as fresh tagliatelle. Another reflection of the evolution of the cuisine over the past 150 years is the addition of tomato, either as a puree or as a concentrated paste, to the common mix of ingredients. Similarly, both wine and milk appear today in the list of ingredients in many of the contemporary recipes, and beef has mostly displaced veal as the dominant meat.\n\nIn 1982, the Italian Academy of Cuisine (\"Accademia Italiana della Cucina\"), an organization dedicated to preserving the culinary heritage of Italy, recorded and deposited a recipe for \"classic Bolognese \"ragù\"\" with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce (\"La Camera di Commercio di Bologna\"). A version of the academy's recipe for American kitchens was also published. The academy's recipe confines the ingredients to beef cut from the plate section (\"cartella di manzo\"), fresh unsmoked pancetta (\"pancetta di maiale distesa\"), onions, carrot, celery, passata (or tomato purée), meat broth, dry white wine, milk, salt and pepper.\n\nNowadays, there are many variations of the recipe even among native Italian chefs, and the repertoire has been further broadened by some American chefs known for their expertise in Italian cuisine.\n\n\"Ragù alla bolognese\" is a complex sauce which involves various cooking techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. As such, it lends itself well to interpretation and adaptation by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Common sources of differences include which meats to use (beef, pork or veal) and their relative quantities, the possible inclusion of either cured meats or offal, which fats are used in the sauté phases (rendered pork fat, butter, olive or vegetable oil), what form of tomato is employed (fresh, canned or paste), the makeup of the cooking liquids (wine, milk, tomato juices, or broth) and their specific sequence of addition.\n\nThe numerous variations among recipes for \"ragù alla bolognese\" have led many to search for the definitive, authentic recipe. Some have suggested the recipe registered by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina in 1982 as the \"most authentic\".\n\nHowever, this would be inconsistent with the academy's own beliefs and statements about remaining faithful to tradition in documenting and preserving Italy's culinary heritage. Prominent Italian chef Mario Caramella stated, \"In Italy, there are several traditional recipes of \"tagliatelle al ragù alla bolognese\" with more or less slight variations\". According to UK cookbook author and food writer Felicity Cloake, \"The fact is that there is no definitive recipe for a bolognese meat sauce, but to be worthy of the name, it should respect the traditions of the area\", a view that is consistent with that often expressed by the Italian Academy of Cuisine.\n\nThe many variations tend to be based on a common theme. For instance, garlic is absent from all of the recipes mentioned above, as are herbs other than the parsimonious use of bay leaves by some. Seasoning is limited to salt, pepper and the occasional pinch of nutmeg. In all of the recipes, meats dominate as the principal ingredient, while tomatoes, in one form or another, are only an auxiliary ingredient.\n\nIn Bologna \"ragù alla bolognese\" is customarily paired and served with tagliatelle made with eggs and northern Italy’s soft wheat flour. Acceptable alternatives to fresh tagliatelle include other broad flat pasta shapes, such as pappardelle or fettuccine, and tube shapes, such as rigatoni and penne. While the main complaint of traditionalists is against the use of spaghetti rather than fresh tagliatelle for the pasta, native Bolognese Piero Valdiserra has argued that \"spaghetti could be considered traditional in Bologna\", even though tagliatelle is the \"most suitable\" pasta.\n\n\"Ragù alla bolognese\" along with \"béchamel\" is also used by many Italian chefs to prepare traditional baked lasagna in Bolognese style.\n\nGruppo Virtuale Cuochi Italiani (GVCI), an international organization and network of culinary professionals dedicated to authentic Italian cuisine, annually organizes and promotes an \"International Day of Italian Cuisines\" (IDIC). In 2010 tagliatelle al ragu alla bolognese was the official dish for IDIC. The event, held on 17 January 2010, included participation by 450 professional chefs in 50 countries who prepared the signature dish according to \"an authentic\" recipe provided by chef Mario Caramella. Media coverage was broad internationally, but reports often incorrectly identified the recipe followed as that of l'Accademia Italiana della Cucina, and some included stock photographs of spaghetti Bolognese.\n\n\"Spaghetti bolognese\" (sometimes called \"spaghetti alla bolognese\", or colloquially \"spag bol\", \"spag bog\", \"spaghetti with meat sauce\", or just \"spaghetti\") is a pasta dish that is commonly served outside Italy. It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and herbs; sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats. In this sense it is actually more similar to Neapolitan ragù from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of ragù. Often accused of 'inauthenticity' when encountered by Italians abroad, it may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to spaghetti than is common in some Italian spaghetti dishes, and the sauce may be laid on top of the spaghetti (rather than being mixed in, in the Italian manner) or even served separately from it (leaving diners to mix it in themselves). It is often served with grated parmesan on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also often used. The sauce is commonly referred to as \"Bolognese sauce\" or just \"spaghetti sauce\", but is actually closer to a Southern or Central Italian style of pasta dish, as true Bolognese sauce is generally served in Italy with tagliatelle ribbons, and not with spaghetti.\n\nAlthough so-called \"spaghetti bolognese\" is a very popular dish outside Italy (such as in Northern, Western and Central parts of Europe, North America, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand), it is not part of traditional Bolognese or Italian cuisine. The origins of the dish are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early twentieth century emigration of southern Italians to the United States or UK as a sort of fusion with local cuisines to produce a hybrid version of \"ragù alla bolognese\" more influenced by the southern tomato-rich style of Neapolitan ragù. In countries where it is common, this sort of sauce is often used for lasagna, whereas in Bologna (and elsewhere in Italy) \"ragù alla bolognese\" is used.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30966218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30966218", "title": "Biological ornament", "text": "Biological ornament\n\nA biological ornament is a characteristic of an animal that appears to serve a decorative function rather than a utilitarian function. Many are secondary sexual characteristics, and others appear on young birds during the period when they are dependent on being fed by their parents. Ornaments are used in displays to attract mates, which may lead to the evolutionary process known as sexual selection. An animal may shake, lengthen, or spread out its ornament in order to get the attention of the opposite sex, which will in turn choose the most attractive one with which to mate. Ornaments are most often observed in males and choosing an extravagantly ornamented male benefits females because the genes that produce the ornament will be passed on to her offspring, increasing their own reproductive fitness. As Ronald Fisher noted, the male offspring will inherit the ornament while the female offspring will inherit the preference for said ornament, which can lead to a positive feedback loop known as a Fisherian runaway. These structures serve as cues to animal sexual behaviour, that is, they are sensory signals that affect mating responses. Therefore, ornamental traits are often selected by mate choice.\n\nThere are several evolutionary explanations for the presence of ornaments. Darwin was the first to correctly hypothesize that sexual selection by female choice was responsible for the evolution of elaborate plumage and remarkable displays in male birds such as the quetzal and the sage grouse. Sexual selection is selection acting on variation among individuals in their ability to obtain access to mating partners. In his book, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex written in 1871, Darwin was perplexed by the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species have because they appeared to be detrimental to survival and have negative consequences for reproductive success. Darwin proposed two explanations for the existence of such traits: these traits are useful in male-male combat or they are preferred by females.\n\nMore recently, many alternative theories of sexual selection have been proposed, many of them centered around the idea that elaborate male ornaments allow females to assess the 'quality' of a male's genes so that she can ensure that her offspring get the best genes (health, physical vigor, etc.). In 1975, Amotz Zahavi proposed the handicap principle, which is the idea that elaborate male ornaments are actually a handicap and that males with such ornaments are demonstrating their physical quality by showing that they can survive despite having such a handicap. Potential mates know that the ornament indicates quality because inferior mates could not afford to produce such wastefully extravagant ornaments. More specifically, ornaments may indicate the underlying genetic quality of the male, for example, in peafowls their tail size and symmetry is largely dictated by genetics. In other words, each peafowl grows the best tail they are able to and only those with the highest genetic quality can produce the most impressive tails. The tail of a peafowl is an honest signal for the female in determining the health status of a potential mate.\n\nIn 1982, William Hamilton and Merlene Zuk proposed that male ornaments may enable healthy males to advertise the fact that they are free of diseases and parasites, a theory that is now known as the \"Bright Male\" hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, if an animal was diseased, it would not be able to grow such beautifully colored plumage. Since disease is a major source of juvenile mortality, females would choose the males with the most elaborate ornaments to ensure that they will have healthy offspring.\n\nOrnamentation is a common biological trait seen in birds. The male quetzal has elaborate ornamentation to aid in mating. Male quetzals have iridescent green wing coverts, back, chest and head, and a red belly. During mating season, male quetzals grow twin tail feathers that form an amazing train up to three feet long (one meter) with vibrant colors. Most female quetzals have no ornamentation and are drab. Coloration and tail feather length in quetzals help determine mate choice because the females choose the more elaborately ornamented males.\n\nOther birds that exhibit ornamentation include sage grouses and widowbirds. Sage grouse birds gather in a lek, or a special display area, and strut and display their plumage to attract a mate. Whereas, the extraordinary tail feathers of the male long-tailed widowbird are displayed to choosy females while the male flies above his grassland territory.\n\nBiological ornamentation is also seen in the \"common roach\" fish, \"Rutilus rutilus\". Male roach develop sexual ornaments (breeding tubercles) during the breeding season. Roach display lek-like spawning behavior, whereby females choose between males, usually choosing the more elaborately ornamented ones.\n\nThere are many instances in which decorations may appear ornamental but actually serve other functions. For example, some species of spiders decorate their webs with shimmering ornaments in order to lure prey. Orb-weaver spiders use elaborate, ultraviolet coloured web ornaments to attract bees that specialize in taking nectar from similarly coloured flowers. In turn, the spider captures the bee in its nest and reaps the food benefits. In this case, what may seem as an ornament to attract mates is actually used as a lure to trap food.\n\nArmaments are anatomical weapons which have evolved amongst species whose males compete intra-sexually for access to females. Armaments are used in direct contests for the opportunity to mate or for the resources needed to attract mates. These weapons such as tusks, antlers, horns, spurs, and lips increase success in rivalry among competitors to gain or maintain dominance, control a harem, or obtain access to territories Examples of animals that use armaments to compete in battle against rival males include deer and antelope; scarabid, lucanid, and cerambycid beetles; certain fish, and narwhales . A buck in peak physical health will shed his antlers later than a weaker buck . Antlers harden just before the breeding season and drop off afterward, and they only occur in males (except in caribou). Antlers are used extensively for fighting and ritualized antler to antler shoving matches.\n\nBiological ornaments are used in courtship displays in many species, especially insects, fish, and birds. A well known ornament used in courting displays is seen in peafowls. Male peacocks spread and shake their tails to attract and impress potential mates. Peahens choose the peacocks with the largest number of eyespots on their tails, because only the healthiest peacocks can afford to divert energy and nutrients towards growing expensive and cumbersome plumage, as explained by the handicap principle. More elaborate ornamentation increases the likelihood that a male will mate and has been shown to affect survival of their offspring. The offspring of males with larger eyespots on their ornamented tails have been shown to weigh more and were more likely to be alive after 2 years than the progeny of males with fewer eyespots.\n\nOrnaments that play a role in reproduction develop under the influence of two series of genes. First, it develops from genes in males that determine the presence and characteristics of the ornament, and second it develops from genes in females that draw her to this kind of ornamentation. Important studies concerning this have been conducted in the Stalk-eyed fly, showing that females are attracted to mates that share characteristics with their fathers. Therefore, sexual selection is a mechanism that differently affects both sexes. Initially, an ornament may have been selected for reasons not linked to reproduction, but over time, the characteristic may become exaggerated due to sexual selection. The females will select for more and more elaborate ornamentation, which represents better survival skills because the male with those characteristics must be physically fit enough to handle the unwanted predator attention that comes with the ornament. Therefore, the males with the most extreme ornamentation will have more offspring, and the gene for \"showiness\" will be passed on. This evolution can then lead to organs of excessive size that may become troublesome for the males, such as large, bushy tails, bright feathers, etc. The point of equilibrium is reached when their ornamentation becomes too much of a handicap on the male's survival, and the \"vital\" natural selection goes to work, altering the exaggerated characteristic until it reaches an equilibrium point.\n\nSexually selected ornaments of males may impose survival costs but advance success in the competition for mates. The interesting thing about sexual ornaments is that they impede the male's chances for survival, yet they continue to be passed on from generation to generation. The larger the male peacock's tail feathers are, or the brighter the birds feathers are, the harder it is for them to escape predators and maneuver through trees, and the more food they will need to eat to develop the ornament. A peacock's tail almost certainly reduces survival of the peacock as they reduce\nmaneuverability, power of flight, and make the bird more conspicuous to predators. Ornaments, therefore, have a great effect on the fitness of the animals that carry them, but the benefits of having an ornament must outweigh the costs for them to be passed on.\n\nBiological ornamentation has been shown to affect parental favoritism in nestlings. This can be observed several species of water birds. For example, baby American coots hatch out with long, orange-tipped plumes on their backs and throats which provide signals to parents used to determine which individuals to feed preferentially. In experiments in which ornaments have been physically altered on baby coots, elaborate ornamentation has been proven to be beneficial to young offspring. Ornamented individuals received more frequent feedings from parents. Therefore, the relative growth rates of ornamented chicks were much higher compared with the experimentally altered chicks.\n\nMale animals are typically more elaborately ornamented than females. The classic sexual selection theory notes that because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs, and because males generally compete more intensely for reproductive opportunities and invest less in parental care than females, males can obtain greater fitness benefits from mating multiple times. Therefore, sexual selection typically results in male-biased sex differences in secondary sexual characteristics, which are non-reproductive body parts that help distinguish between sexes in a species.\n\nFemale ornamentation has long been overlooked because of the greater prevalence of elaborate displays in males. However, the circumstances under which females would benefit from honestly signaling their quality are limited. Females are not expected to invest in ornamentation unless the fitness benefits of the ornament exceed those from investing the resources directly into offspring. An example of a scenario in which female ornamentation occurs is in the pipefish. Within this species of fish, sex roles are reversed so the male is responsible for the postzygotic care. Accordingly, females must compete for access to male parental care. Thus, females have been selected for ornamentation as the benefit of producing the ornamentation, namely male paternal care, outweighs the costs, such as the energy requirements. Most notably, their venter becomes more colourful during breeding season. Males tend to prefer females with more colourful venters, with research showing that there is a positive association between this ornament and the condition of the female. As this ornamentation reliably indicates mate quality, it can be considered an honest signal. In the phalaropes and the Eurasian dotterel, females are more brightly colored than males, and it is the males who are primarily responsible for parental care.\n\nIt has been proposed that when females gain direct benefits from mating, females may instead be selected for ornamentation that deceives males about their reproductive state. In empidid dance flies, males frequently provide nuptial gifts and it is usually to only the female that is ornamented. Female traits in empidids, such as abdominal sacs and enlarged pinnate leg scales, have been suggested to 'deceive' males into matings by disguising egg maturity.\n"}

Pop singer Lady Gaga believes the flavor was named after her and has threatened to sue the creators of the ice cream flavor, while creator Matt O'Connor insists it was a play on the words spoken by infants and refuses to change the name.\n\nThe ice cream was invented by Matt O'Connor founder of The Licktators London, a company which makes controversial flavored ice cream, including “female viagra” an infused flavor known as Vice Cream. O’Connor claims it is a healthy alternative to other ice creams in the bar. The ice cream was originally sold exclusively in The Icecreamists, in Covent Garden, London. The ice cream went on sale on 25 February 2011. Within a week of going on sale, the ice cream was seized by officers of Westminster Council to test whether it was suitable for human consumption.\n\nThe Lickators company partnered with breast feeding advocate Victoria Hailey to relaunch the Baby Gaga flavor in 2015. Hailey, has said that the re-launch of the flavor was done to commemorate the birth of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge’ and Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge second child, Princess Charlotte. Hailey, said that the re-release gives her the opportunity to reach more people with her breastfeeding platform and \"reminds the Duchess of Cambridge, and mothers around the country, of the benefits of breastfeeding.”\n\nThe ice cream flavor is available in select stores throughout London and the packaging features the duchess of Cambridge on the front. The Licktators website has said that part of the profits from each tub purchased will be donated to a breast feeding charity.\n\nAs for the controversy over the flavor owner Matt O'Connor says that, \"Of course there are those who think it is obnoxious, but the ice cream is made with natural breast milk, organic and free range.\"\n\nAt least 15 mothers have volunteered to donate their breast milk. The breast milk donors have been medically screened and the milk pasteurized. Donors also have to meet hospital/blood donor requirements.\n\nThe milk is then flavored with vanilla and lemon zest. Collect all important ingredients to make sure that Baby Gaga ice cream is ready to be consumed.

Also the milk has to be pasteurized so that it doesn't contain bacteria.\n\nThe Eatery pays 15 pounds ($24) for every 10 ounces of milk.\n\nLady Gaga has twice taken legal action against O'Connor and The Licktators in order to remove the name 'Baby Gaga' from all marketing and social media posts featuring the Baby Gaga ice cream. Her legal team issued cease-and-desist orders in 2011 and 2015 and Lady Gaga has stated that she does not support the breast-milk based product, claiming the flavor composes a trademark violation on the name “Gaga” and will confuse consumers into thinking she supports the ice cream.\n"}

{"id": "31113136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31113136", "title": "Autism and working memory", "text": "Autism and working memory\n\nAutism is a variation of neural development diagnosed as impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. It affects an estimated 1 in 100 people. Autism is one of three recognized variations in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met. In this article, the word \"autism\" is used for referring to the whole range of variations on the autism spectrum, which is not uncommon.\n\nWorking memory is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind, where they can be manipulated. This system has a limited capacity. Working memory is a part of the executive functions (EF), an umbrella term for cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes, for instance planning and attention.\n\nA majority of the research has found that individuals with autism perform poorly on measures of executive function. A general decrease in working memory (WM) is one of the limitations, although some studies have found that working memory is not impaired in autistic children relative to controls matched for IQ. However, some evidence suggests that there may be minimal impairment in high-functioning autistic (HFA) individuals in that they have intact associative learning ability, verbal working memory, and recognition memory. In rare cases there are even instances of individuals possessing extremely good memory in constricted domains which are typically characterized as savants. Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers also suggest that WM deficits and limited EF is likely compounded by the onset of autism where early development yields hindrances in social interaction which typically (i.e. without impairment) improves both WM and EF. However, due to limited ability in interpreting social gestures and an impaired ability to process such information in a holistic and comprehensive manner, individuals with autism are subject to diminished and confounding instances of memory function and performance.\n\nThe physical underpinnings of the cause for differences in the working memory of autistic people has been studied. Bachevalier suggests a major dysfunction in the brain of an autistic individual resides in the neural mechanisms of the structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and perhaps, more specifically the amygdaloid complex. This may have implications in their ability to encode information because of the role the MTL and especially the hippocampal areas play in information processing DeLong reinforces this by suggesting autism to affect hippocampal function. Because the hippocampus is pivotal in memory encoding and modulating memory consolidation, any impairment can drastically affect an autistic individual's ability to process (i.e. multi-modal) and retain information. Sumiyoshi, Kawakubo, Suga, Sumiyoshi and Kasai have suggested that it is possible that the attenuated neural activities in parahippocampal regions might have something to do with the abnormal organization of information of individuals within the autistic spectrum. The left parahippocampal region (including the parahippocampal gyrus) has an implied role in sorting, relating, and sending information to the hippocampus and thus any abnormal activity or dysfunction within these regions might be accountable for the degree of effectiveness autistic individuals organize information. This is in keeping with other findings that suggest unconventional activity or lack of activity within the hippocampal regions which have a role in explaining some aspects of ASD.\n\nFurther evidence suggests that there is abnormal circuitry in what Brothers calls the neural basis for social intelligence, or holistically interpreting people's expressions and intentions. The interaction between the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STG) enables one to process social information for personal interaction. In the case of autistic individuals there seems to be a limitation in these structures such that facial expressions, body language and speech expressions (ex. sarcasm) go consciously unnoticed. However, Frith and Hill suggest that through 'remediation' or training that attends to specific traits in expressions, social understanding can be partially improved.\n\nBeversdorf finds that because autistic individuals are not as reliant on contextual information (i.e. comparing typically related schemas) to aid in memory consolidation, they are less likely to rely on semantically similar cues (ex. Doctor-Nurse vs. Doctor-Beach). Thus, an autistic individual would fare well on discriminating and recalling accurate items from false items.\n\nBennetto, Pennington and Rogers investigated the degree of cognitive impairment in autistic individuals with an emphasis on illuminating the latency in executive functioning. Findings suggested a hindrance in temporal order, source, free recall and working memory. However, their participants did exhibit capable short and long term memory, cued recall and the capacity to learn new material. In sum, they suggested that there is both a general deficit in global working memory and a specific impairment in social intelligence where the former is exacerbated by the latter and vice versa.\n\nOther evidence points towards unique mnemonic strategies used by autistic individuals wherein they rely less on semantic associative networks and are less constricted by conventional word-word associations (ex. Orange-Apple). This may be due to abnormalities in MTL regions. Thus, autistic individuals may have the capacity for more abstract but robust associations. Firth addresses this with the term “weak Central Coherence”, meaning a reduced tendency for processing information in context and integration of higher-level meaning. This may explain why autistic individuals have a heightened capacity for noticing seemingly disjointed details. For example, in the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) autistic individuals exhibited a heightened ability to locate the target because of their diminished reliance on global perception.\nIn a study conducted on autistic children, it was shown that neurocognition influences word learning in autistic children. The process of syntactic development requires a child to match co-occurrences of words or parts of words (morphemes) and their meanings. This process can depend on working memory. The limited short term verbal memory paired with working memory may be the reason of language delay in children with autism. According to the result of this experiment the group with autism was able to perform the part of the test with nonlinguistic cues which depended on working memory but failed to pass short term memory and the linguistic part of it. This explains the delay of language in autistic children and neurocognition is an important contributor to it.\n\nAutism spectrum disorders are thought to be caused in part by dysfunction of the working memory. In examining autism through the lens of Baddeley & Hitch’s model of working memory there have been conflicting results in research. Some studies have shown that individuals that fall within the spectrum have impaired executive functioning, that is, working memory does not function correctly and thus these individuals have less cognitive flexibility and reduced inhibition within working memory. However, other studies have failed to find an effect in autistic people with a high level of functioning. Tests such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test have been administered to autistic individuals and the lower scores have been interpreted as indicative of a poor ability to focus on relevant information and thus a deficit within the central executive aspect of working memory. An aspect of ASD is that it might be present, to a certain extent, in first degree relatives. One study found that siblings of autistic individuals have limited ability to focus and conceptualize categories using updated information. Given these results, it is reasonable to suggest that these so-called deficits in cognitive ability are of the cognitive endophenotypes (i.e. relatives) of ASD.\n\nGiven these findings it would appear as if autistic individuals have trouble categorizing. Studies have shown that category induction is in fact possible and can occur at the same cognitive level as non-autistic individuals, however. Given that category formation aspects such as discrimination and feature detection are enhanced amongst autistic individuals it is viable to state that although autistic individuals require more trials and or time to learn material, and also may employ different learning strategies than non-autistic individuals, once learned, the level of categorization displayed is on par with a non-autistic individual.\n\nThe idea that autistic individuals employ a different style of learning than people who do not fall in the spectrum can account for the delay in categorization but the resulting average level of cognitive ability. This, however, is only applicable to higher functioning individuals within the spectrum as those with lower IQ levels are notoriously difficult to test and measure.\nIn part with a different style of learning, individuals within the spectrum have also been proposed to have a weak central coherence. This theory meshes well with the general traits of individuals within the spectrum. Again though, this is explained through different learning styles. As opposed to viewing a forest as a collection of trees, those with autism see one tree, and another tree, and another tree and thus it takes an immense amount of time to process complex tasks in comparison with non-autistic people). Weak central coherence can be used to explain what is viewed as a working memory deficit in attention or inhibition, as autistic individuals possess an intense focus on single parts of a complex, multi-part concept and cannot inhibit this in order to withdraw focus and direct it on the whole rather than a singular aspect. Thus, this suggests that the decrement in working memory is partially inherited which is then exacerbated by further genetic complications leading to a diagnosis of autism.\n\nDeficits in spatial working memory appear to be familiar in people with autism, and probably even in their close relatives. Replication of movements by others, a task that requires spatial awareness and memory capacities, can also be difficult for autistic children and adults.\n\nPeople with Asperger's Syndrome were found to have spatial working memory deficits compared with control subjects on the Executive-Golf Task, although these may be indicative of a more general deficit in non-verbal intelligence in people with ASD. Despite these results, autistic children have been found to be superior to typically developing children in certain tasks, such as map learning and cued path recall regarding a navigated real-life labyrinth. Steele et al. attempt to explain this discrepancy by advancing the theory that the performance of autistic people on spatial memory tasks degrades faster in the face of increasing task difficulty, when compared with normally developed individuals. These results suggest that working memory is related with an individual's ability to solve problems, and that autism is a hindrance in this area.\n\nAutistic people appear to have a \"local bias\" for visual information processing, that is, a preference for processing local features (details, parts) rather than global features (the whole). One explanation for this local bias is that people with autism do not have the normal global precedence when looking at objects and scenes. Alternatively, autism could bring about limitations in the complexity of information that can be manipulated in short-term visual memory during graphic planning.\n\nThe difficulties that individuals with ASD often have in regards to facial recognition has prompted further questions. Some research has shown that the fusiform gyrus in ASD individuals acts differently from in non-ASD individuals which may explain the aforementioned troubles regarding facial recognition.\n\nResearch by Baltruschat et al. has shown that improvement in spatial working memory for autistic individuals may be possible. Adapting a behaviorist approach by using positive reinforcement could increase WM efficiency in young children with ASD.\n\nThe research on phonological working memory in autism is extensive and at times conflicting. Some research has found that, in comparison with spatial memory, verbal memory and inner speech use remain relatively spared, while other studies have found limitations on the use of inner speech by autistic people. Others have found a benefit to phonological processing in autism when compared with semantic processing, and attribute the results to a similar developmental abnormality to that in savant syndrome.\n\nIn particular, Whitehouse et al. have found that autistic children, when compared with typically developing (TD) children of a similar mean verbal age and reading ability, performed better when asked to recall a set of pictures presented to them, but not as well when asked to recall a set of printed words presented interspersed with the pictures; a competing verbal task given to both sets of participants also worsened performance on control children more than it did on autistic children. They also reported that word length effects were greater for the control group. These results are contested by Williams, Happé, and Jarrold, who contend that it may be verbal IQ, rather than verbal ability, that is at issue, and Whitehouse et al.'s subjects were not matched on chronological age. Williams, Happé, and Jarrold themselves found no difference between autistic children and controls on a serial recall task where phonological similarity effects, rather than word length effects, were used as an alternate measure of inner speech use.\n\nJoseph et al. found that a self-ordered pointing task in autistic children involving stimuli that could be remembered as words (e.g. shovel, cat) was impaired relative to comparison children, but the same task with abstract stimuli was not impaired in autistic children. In contrast, Williams et al. found that autistic children scored significantly lower than TD children on spatial memory tests. Williams et al. not only experimented with spatial memory tasks, but verbal memory as well. They discovered that in an experimental group and a control group of TD individuals, that while differences were found in spatial memory ability, no significant difference was seen between the groups regarding verbal memory. They ran their experiments with both children and adult participants. Autism is a developmental disorder, so it is possible that life experiences could alter the memory performance in adults who had grown up with autism. Williams et al. experimented with children separately to see if they had different results from their adult counterparts. They used a WRAML (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning) test, a test specifically designed to test memory in children. Test results were similar across all age groups, that significant differences between TD and autistic participants are found only in spatial memory, not verbal working memory.\n\nGabig et al. discovered that children with autism, regarding verbal working memory and story retelling, performed worse than a control group of TD children. In three separate tasks designed to test verbal working memory, the autistic children scored well below the expected levels for their age. While results do show lower scores for autistic children, there was also information that suggested lack of vocabulary contributed to the lower scores, rather than working memory itself.\n\nThere is some evidence from an fMRI study that autistic individuals are more likely to use visual cues rather than verbal cues on some working memory tasks, based on the differentially high activation of right parietal regions over left parietal regions in an N-back working memory task with letters.\n\nSome data has shown that individuals with ASD may not have WM impairments and that this supposed impairment observed is a result of testing. Nakahachi et al. argue that the vagueness of many tests measuring WM levels in people with ASD. They found that people with ASD only performed worse on WM tests if the test itself could have interfered with the completion of the test. These findings show that the type of test and the way it is presented given to individuals with ASD can strongly affect the results, therefore much caution should be taken in choosing the design of a study focusing on WM in people with ASD.\n\nOzonoff et al. have found similar results in their studies on working memory in individuals with ASD. Their research showed no significant difference between individuals with ASD and those without ASD in tests designed to measure various aspects of working memory. This supports the notion that Autism does not inhibit WM. Results from experiments that have shown lower WM facilities in ASD individuals may be due to the human interaction nature of these experiments as individuals with ASD exhibit low social functioning skills. Experiments utilizing computer rather than human interaction remove this problem and may head more accurate findings.\n\nFurther research by Griffith et al. also indicates that WM may not be impaired in those with Autism. There may be some executive function impairments in these individuals, but not in working memory and rather in social and language skills. Other research conducted by Griffith et al. on young Autistic individuals did not measure verbal working abilities, but nonetheless found no significant difference between the executive functions in Autistic and non-Autistic individuals. Though there has been much research that alludes to low WM abilities in those with Autism, these recent data weaken the argument that Autistic individuals have little WM facilities.\n\n"}

Among the many hard candy varieties are stick candy such as the candy cane, lollipops, aniseed twists, and \"bêtises de Cambrai\".\n\nMost hard candy is nearly 100% sugar by weight. Recipes for hard candy may use syrups of sucrose, glucose, fructose or other sugars. Sugar-free versions have also been created.\n\nOnce the syrup blend reaches the target temperature, the candy maker removes it from the heat source and may add citric acid, food dye, and some flavouring, such as a plant extract, essential oil, or flavourant. \n\nThe syrup concoction, which is now very thick, can be poured into a mold or tray to cool. When the syrup is cool enough to handle, it can be folded, rolled, or molded into the shapes desired. After the boiled syrup cools, it is called \"hard candy\", since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature.\n\nChemically, sugar candies are broadly divided into two groups: crystalline candies and amorphous candies. \"Crystalline candies\" are not as hard as crystals of the mineral variety, but derive their name and their texture from their microscopically organized sugar structure, formed through a process of crystallization, which makes them easy to bite or cut into. \"Amorphous candies\" have a disorganized crystalline structure.

Many apothecaries used sugar candy to make their prescriptions more palatable to their customers.\nThey are also carried by people with hypoglycemia to quickly raise their low blood sugar level which, when untreated, can sometimes lead to fainting and other physical complications, and are used as part of diabetic management.\n\nHard candies and throat lozenges prepared without sugar employ isomalt as a sugar substitute, and are sweetened further by the addition of an artificial sweetener, such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, or a sugar alcohol, such as xylitol.\n\n\n\n"}

He added 67 strings to the traditional 13 string koto design, creating an instrument much like a western harp. Together, the 80 strings provide a far larger pitch range than the standard Koto. It is widely seen as a short-lived experimental instrument. \nThe 80-string koto was largely hand-constructed as only limited machinery existed to manufacture it. It was built along similar lines to the common Koto, but with reinforced design elements. The platform where strings are tied runs the entire length and breadth of the instrument to accommodate the increased strain.\n\nAs with other kotos, The kiri wood (\"paulownia tomentosa\") is molded and treated. Modern bridges are often made of plastic and they can be found in both small and large sizes. These bridges are rearranged as needed during playing. Strings are traditionally made from Silk threads, although plastic nylon strings are often used as a cheaper alternative. \n\nThe bridges are arranged according to the particular tuning used.\n\nThis kind of koto is not widely used. There are few extant examples of the instrument today, as it never achieved the popularity of the 17-string koto, Miyagi's more widely accepted invention.\n"}

The main ingredient used in \"semur\" gravy is sweet soy sauce, shallots, onions, garlic, ginger, candlenut, nutmeg and cloves, sometimes pepper, coriander, cumin and cinnamon might be added. \n\nSweet soy sauce is the most important ingredient in the \"Semur\"-making process because it serves to strengthen the flavor, but it should still be blended harmoniously with the other ingredients. In addition to the spices and seasonings, \"semur\" also consists of a wide range of main ingredients with variation in the presentation, such as meat (mainly beef), beef tongue, potato, tofu, tomato, tempeh, eggs, chicken, fish and often sprinkled with fried shallot or other variations according to the tastes of the communities in each regions.\n\n\"Semur\" is derived from the Dutch verb \"\"smoren\"\", which means \"to braise food\".\n\nHistory shows that the dish of marinated boiled meat in Indonesia has been known since the 9th century CE in ancient Java. This can be seen from some of the inscriptions, and reliefs of the temples in Java that tells \"\"Ganan, hadanan prana wdus\"\" or \"buffaloes and goats served with vegetables\". However, whether the buffalo and goat meat mentioned in these records was the same dishes like stews today is still uncertain.\n\nFor centuries Indonesia has attracted world traders for its natural resources. Exotic flavors of Indonesian spices such as nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon have attracted traders. Foreign traders and immigrants brought their culture, which gradually blended into everyday Indonesian culture. This assimilation has developed a blend of traditions of the archipelago, including culinary. The European Dutch colonial believed to have brought the stew technique, and combine it with local spices and local sweet soy sauce, dark soy sauce with caramelized palm sugar and various spiced added, that has become one of the most popular flavouring. The particular flavor of Indonesian spices combined with a variety of foreign food processing techniques has resulted in the creation of unique dishes such as \"semur\", which existed from 1600.\n\nCenturies of interactions between the Netherlands and Indonesia have contributed to the development of the stew's flavor. Javanese stew that in the earlier served as the main menu in the banquet of the Dutch is derived from the word \"smoor\" (Dutch: \"stew\"). \"Smoor\" in Dutch means food that has simmered with tomatoes and onions in a long cook process. One of the oldest and most cookbook recipes complete document in the Dutch East Indies, \"Groot Nieuw Oost-Indisch Volledig Kookboek\" published in 1902, contains six recipes stew (\"Smoor Ajam I\", \"Ajam Smoor II\", \"Smoor Ajam III\", \"Smoor Bandjar van Kip\", \"Smoor Bantam van Kip\", \"Solosche Smoor van Kip\"). This book asserts that the later smoor stew was the kitchen cooking method developed in Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) by the Eurasian.\n\nOver time, \"semur\" was incorporated into Indonesian tradition and served in a variety of traditional events. Javanese with their preference on sweet dishes has favoured \"semur\" and consider it as part of Javanese cuisine. Betawi people in Jakarta have adopted \"semur\" as part of their tradition that is always served during \"Lebaran\", weddings, and any important celebrations. Betawi people like to cook dogfruit with spices and soy sauce to make \"semur jengkol\" (dogfruit stew) Not only Betawi culture, semur are also often appeared on the celebration events in various parts of the archipelago such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, with the flavor and appearance that suit local tastes.\n\nAt first, \"semur\" was associated to the beef that is processed in thick brown gravy. However it was later developed into various ingredients and recipes; ox tongue, mutton, chicken, eggs, also for vegetable products, such as tofu, tempeh, eggplant, and others. \"Semur\" has become a daily dishes served in Indonesian households and can be found in various parts of Indonesia.\n\n\"Semur\" might be served individually with rice, \"lontong\", or as part of the whole complete meal of \"rijsttafel\", buffet or as one of side dishes in \"tumpeng, nasi uduk\" or \"nasi rames\".\n\n\n"}

In its simplest form it consists of corn tortillas dipped in a sauce of \"pepita\" (pumpkin seeds) filled with hard-boiled eggs, and garnished with a cooked tomato-pepper sauce.\n\nTwo theories exist about the origin of the name. Diana Kennedy says it derives from a phrase meaning \"food of the lords\" because this dish was reportedly fed to the Spaniards. Variations of this etymology appear elsewhere. The second theory posits that it derives from Mayan \"papakʼ\", to anoint or smear, and \"sul\", to soak or drench, making the meaning something along the lines of \"smeared and drenched\".\n\nPapadzules are said to be a very ancient dish, the forerunner of modern enchiladas, even. However, it is not clear that this dish was actually made in pre-Hispanic times, at least in the way it is made today. First, there is a lack of comals in the archaeological record of the Yucatán, implying that the Mayans did not make the thin tortillas required for filling. Second, the historical record seems to indicate that the Mayans preferred making thicker tortillas cooked in ashes. These thicker tortillas, depending on how thick they were, would have been harder to fill. The modern \"pim\" (Mayan thick tortilla) can range in thickness from the height of three tortillas up to approximately half an inch.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the dish was constructed in the pre-Hispanic period as it is today, the ancient Mayans would have had access to all of the basic ingredients used in the modern dish. Corn, tomatoes, and chiles were all staples in the Mesoamerican diet. Pumpkin seeds, likewise, were an important part of the Mayan diet. Chicken eggs were unknown to pre-Hispanic Mayans, but several other fowl capable of providing eggs were known and eaten. Turkeys and muscovy ducks were both domesticated, and both produce edible eggs. In addition to that, the Mayans ate non-domesticated fowl including the curassow, crested guan, horned guan, chachalaca, and ocellated turkey, although it is unclear the extent to which edible eggs could have been obtained from these birds. Aside from the eggs of fowl, iguana eggs were also used in Mayan cooking and could conceivably have been used to make this dish.\n\nPapadzules are prepared by filling a tortilla dipped in a pumpkin seed sauce with chopped hard-boiled eggs. The sauce is created by toasting pumpkin seeds, grinding them to a powder, and blending with a broth of epazote. However, prior to blending, the toasted, ground seeds have their oil extracted by mixing the powder with a small amount of water and squeezing the resulting paste with your hands. This oil is collected and reserved for use as a garnish. After the tortillas have been dipped in the pumpkin seed sauce and filled, the dish is topped with a cooked tomato-chile sauce. Traditionally, the chile used in this sauce is the habanero. Finally, the reserved oil is sprinkled on top.\n\nIn the Yucatán, a specific type of pumpkin seed, called \"xt’op\" (Mayan) or \"pepita gruesa\" (Spanish), is used for this dish. These seeds come from the type of pumpkin called \"xka’al\".\n\n\n"}

Chifle is not to be confused with banana chips.\n\nIn Peru chifle is typical of the Piura Region. It consists of fried slices or strips of either ripe or green plantains seasoned with salt to taste. In the region of Piura, chifle is traditionally fried in wood-burning stoves with wood of the \"algorrobo blanco\" (a species of mesquite tree), which gives chifle a special aroma and taste. Depending on the type of plantain (ripe or green) the flavor can be sweet or savory. Sometimes it is served with \"cancha serrana\" (pan-roasted :maize) or shredded \"cecina\" (pork jerky).\n\nAt present, the \"Asociación de Productores de Chifles Piuranos\" (APROCHIP, English: Piura Chifle Producers Association) has initiated the process to declare chifle as a \"producto de bandera nacional\" (English: flagship product) of Peru. APROCHIP of Piura is an agglomeration of 14 local commercial chifle producers.\n\nAn incision is made in the peel the full length of the plantain, and the peel is removed by hand. The plantains are immediately placed in salt water. Then the plantain is cut into thin slices, either across (round slices, like chips), or lengthwise (strips). The plantain slices are cooked in hot oil until golden and crispy. Then they are seasoned with salt.\n\nA more crispy variety of chifle is prepared and packaged in factories. This includes sweet, savory, and spicy varieties. The commercial production and export of chifle was a product of the fact that South American travelers were interested in the uses of plantains. Early 19th-century travelers on ships entering and leaving the port of Guayaquil were served chifle (instead of bread) with meals, including breakfast, and discovered its use as a snack food.\n\nAccording to Peruvian historians, the term \"chifle\" most likely comes from the Arabic \"chofre\", which in Medieval Spain was used to refer to the blade of the sword, lending the name to the snack food of fried plantains sliced into circles with the blade of a sword. Another view is that \"chifle\" means horn (or antler) and the term was used because of the resemblance between the two. A third view suggests that the term originates from the whistling sound made while eating the snack.\n\nThe word \"chifle\" is of unknown origin and does not appear in the dictionary of the Spanish language. In the rural social environment of the Ecuadorian coast, principally in the provinces of \"Montubio\" cultural origin, \"chiflar\" was a vulgar and colloquial term that means to \"whistle\" with the mouth in a notably sharp sound by pinching the bottom lip and pushing air out from the lungs, resulting in a strong sound (sometimes pleasant or unpleasant) to catch the listener's attention. In the Montubia ethnic culture of the coast of Ecuador, this sound was popularly used to call family or close kinsmen from long distances.\n\nEvery tropical country where the plantain is in high consumption has its local version of this snack. It is known as \"chipilo\" in Bolivia; \"plataninas\" in Guatemala; \"pazhampori\" in South India; \"mariquitas\" (English: lady bugs) in Cuba; in Puerto Rico \"platanutres\", \"platanitos\" in the Dominican Republic, and \"tostones\" or \"tostoncitos\" in Venezuela.\n\nMore recently, both ordinary and specially flavoured chifles have entered the European market as \"plantain chips\", produced and distributed by Fyffes of Ireland.\n\n"}

Since entering the U.S. market Belvedere has partnered with a number of celebrities including Chelsea Handler, Usher and John Legend. In 2015, the brand was chosen as the official vodka of the 24th James Bond film, \"Spectre\".\n\nThe distillery that produces Belvedere was constructed in 1910. Production began in 1993 at the facility located at Polmos Żyrardów, Poland. In 2002, 40% of Millennium was acquired by the luxury goods group LVMH and in April 2005 this stake was raised to 100%. The brand was endorsed by Chelsea Handler and sponsored her Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang comedy tour based on her book of the same name in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Belvedere Vodka began a partnership with Product Red featuring R&B singer Usher to release a limited edition, specially branded bottle and donating up to 50% of the profits to the Global Fund, which fights HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.

In September 2017, the Belvedere announced it would cease production on its 'Unfiltered' version of its vodka and release the Single Estate Rye series. In 2018, Belvedere partnered with singer-songwriter and actress Janelle Monáe to produce a series of short films.\n\nIn order for Belvedere Vodka to be labeled as a \"super premium\" Polska Wódka (Polish Vodka), the vodka must be produced using specific Polish grains or potatoes and Polish water. The official labeling of Polish Vodka also requires that no artificial additives be added to vodkas. As such, Belvedere Vodka uses varieties of Dankowskie rye harvested from one of seven nearby farms in its \"luxury\" vodka. To produce the vodka, the rye is harvested and simmered to form a mash which is then fermented and distilled at an agricultural distillery before undergoing distillation three additional times at the Belvedere distillery.\n\nBelvedere also produces flavored vodkas which are produced using a maceration process. The brand's flavored variants are produced by combining pure spirit with a macerated fruit, which is then distilled at a low temperature to form a macerate concentrate. The concentrated mixture is blended with the distillery's artesian well water to bottling strength and bottled. These flavors are not charcoal filtered, and are filtered through cellulose particle filters prior to bottling. This is done with the intention of ensuring essential oils that carry fruit flavors and give mouth feel are retained. The Belvedere Maceration product line includes Mango Passion, Lemon Tea, Bloody Mary, Pink Grapefruit, Black Raspberry, Orange, Citrus and Ginger Zest.\n\nOn March 23, 2012, Belvedere Vodka's Twitter and Facebook pages posted a branded image that was attacked for seemingly making light of rape.

This is also the basis on which they refer to their product as \"handcrafted\" due to the reasonably smaller batches produced. They use a 20-foot column still in which their spirits are distilled at least 20 times per batch. This is compared to a traditional pot still which some consider to produce a less clean or less pure product. The column still used also allows them to produce their product more efficiently at a fraction of the energy typically used in similar processes. It is estimated to be 200% more efficient than a traditional pot still. In addition to its low energy use, the water used in the distillation is recycled between a custom two tank water reclamation system. This allows them to reuse the 3,000 gallons of water for multiple batches instead of having to waste more with each distillation process. The water used is that of a private family-owned spring fed creek that flows through the Fall Creek Ranch.

It was invented in the 16th century and by the 18th century was being used to transmit power up to four kilometres. Flatrod systems were widely used in the Harz and Ore Mountains of Germany as well as in Cornwall, England and Bergslagen in Sweden.\n\nA replica of a flatrod system may be seen in Bad Kösen in Germany on the River Saale and there is a replica water wheel, used to drive flatrods, in Clausthal-Zellerfeld in the Upper Harz, formerly the biggest mining region in Europe.\n\nThe flatrod system dates to the period before the invention of the steam engine and electricity. Using flatrods it was possible to operate man engines and pumping systems, even though the water wheel in question had a rotary, not a reciprocal, motion. So that the rods could be made to move in a reciprocal fashion, a change of direction had to be achieved by means of specially shaped components. The components of the system that were mounted in the mining shaft were called shaft rods (\"Schachtgestänge\") or pump rods (\"Hubgestänge\"). Systems mounted in drift mines were called drift rods (\"Streckengestänge\").\n\nThe flatrods (\"Feldgestänge\") themselves were used to transfer power over greater distances between the main engine and the pump rods. Iron collars (\"Kunstringe\") were fitted onto the wheel axles, connecting pipes (\"Ansetzröhren\") and metal sleeves (\"Ansteckkielen\") as well as certain parts of the wooden flatrods. The actual rods (\"Kunststangen\") were long squared timbers that transmitted the power horizontally or at an incline. They had articulated iron joints (\"Kunstschlösser\" or \"Stangenschlösser\") that were designed such that they could be interleaved into one another and secured with bolts or screws.\n\nThe lifting rod system ran vertically up the mineshaft, either to transfer power to the individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, in the case of man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the lifting rod system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (\"Holzlaschen\"). These joints were tightly bound to the ends of the lifting rods with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (\"Kolbenstangen\"). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (\"Kunstkreuz\") was fitted to the lifting rods. Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (\"Kunstschloss\"). To balance the load it was usual to have two lifting rods.\n\nThe purpose of the flatrods was to transfer the power of the motive engine over greater distances to the pump rods in the shaft. This was necessary if the motive engine could not be mounted above or immediately next to the mine shaft. A flatrod system had the disadvantage that there were additional efficiency losses due to the greater masses that had to be moved. The reciprocal motion in the joints (\"Schlösser\") of the interconnected flatrods lead to lifting losses of from 25 to 50 percent. In addition the construction of flatrods required additional timber. This was very maintenance-intensive due to the effects of weathering and it needed additional staff to inspect and maintain the flatrods.\n\nThe flatrods consisted of several wooden rods, fitted with iron hinges. At the ends of the rods, on either side, were so-called \"Kunstschlösser\". These were cut to fit in such a way that one rod could be mortised into another. This was necessary so that the flatrods could not slide apart as a result of to-and-fro or up-and-down motion.\n\nThere were two types of flatrod: flatrods with rollers and flatrods with oscillating cranks (\"Schwingen\"). The former were laid on rollers. The rollers consisted of round timbers about eight to ten inches thick, that were firmly set into the ground on their underside and fixed in place with braces. In order to minimise friction, the rod was fitted with a drag rail (\"Schleppschiene\") in the area of the individual rollers that was made of beechwood and long enough to for the entire stroke length.\n"}

A well-known example is \"gānshǐjué\"/\"kanshiketsu\" (lit. 乾屎橛 \"dry shit stick\") from the Chan/Zen \"gōng'àn\"/\"kōan\" in which a monk asked \"What is Buddha?\" and Master Yunmen/Unmon answered \"A dry shit stick\".\n\nPeople have used many different materials in the history of anal cleansing, including leaves, rags, paper, water, sponges, corncobs, and sticks.\n\nAccording to the historians of Chinese science Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen, \nIn very ancient times, instruments of bamboo, possibly spatulas ([\"cèchóu\"] 廁籌, [\"cèbì\"] 廁箆, or [\"cèjiǎn\"] 廁簡), may have been used with the assistance of water in cleaning the body after defecation. At other times and places, it seems that pieces of earthenware or pottery were so used. Undoubtedly one material which found employment in this respect was waste silk rag. (Needham 1970: 373)\n\nWhen monks and missionaries introduced Buddhism into China and Japan, they also brought the Indian custom of using a \"śalākā\" \"small stake, stick, or rod\" for wiping away excrement. Translators rendered this Sanskrit word into a number of different neologisms such as Chinese \"cèchóu\" 廁籌 and Japanese \"chūgi\" 籌木, and the custom of using shit sticks became popular. They had advantages of being inexpensive, washable, and reusable.\n\nThe Chinese invented paper around the 2nd century BCE, and toilet paper no later than the 6th century CE, when Yan Zhitui noted, \"Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from the Five Classics or the names of sages, I dare not use for toilet purposes\" (tr. Needham 1986: 123).\n\nThe earliest Japanese flush toilets date from the Nara period (710–784), when a drainage system was constructed in the capital at Nara, with squat toilets built over 10–15 cm wide wooden conduits that users would straddle. Archaeological excavations in Nara have also found numerous \"chūgi\" wooden sticks that were used for fecal cleansing (Chavez 2014). (Matsui et al. 2003: 133) explain that Japanese archeologists have discovered comparatively few toilets because \"the decisive factors in identifying toilets were fly maggots and flat sticks called \"chugi\" used as a toilet paper\", but preservation of such artifacts requires the environment of a wetland site where organic remains are constantly soaked with groundwater.\n\nArcheologists discovered 2,000-year-old shit sticks in a latrine at Xuanquanzhi 悬泉置, in the town of Dunhuang, Gansu. Xuanquanzhi was a Han dynasty military base and relay station (111 BCE – CE 109) at the eastern end of the Silk Road. Analysis of preserved fecal matter found on cloth covers wrapped around the ends of sticks revealed the remains of roundworm (\"Ascaris lumbricoides\"), whipworm (\"Trichuris trichiura\"), tapeworm (\"Taenia solium\"), and Chinese liver fluke (\"Clonorchis sinensis\") (Yeh et al. 2016; Bower 2016; Newitz 2016).\n\nThe Chinese and Japanese lexicons have various words meaning \"shit stick\". They are divisible into compounds of \"chóu\" or \"chū\" 籌 \"small stake or stick\", \"jué\" or \"ketsu\" 橛 \"short stake or stick\", and other terms.\n\nChinese \"chóu\" or Japanese \"chū\" 籌 \"small stake; stick; chip; tally; counter; token\" is used in the \"shit stick\" terms and \"chóumù\" or \"chūgi\" 籌木 (with 木 \"tree; wood\") and \"cèchóu\" 廁籌 (with 廁 \"toilet\").\n\n\"Chóu\" or \"chū\" was used to translate the polysemous Buddhist Sanskrit term \"śalāka\" or \"śalākā\" (Pali \"salākā\").\nIn Indian Buddhist contexts, \"śalākā\" particularly meant \"a piece of wood or bamboo used for counting or voting\". \"Salaka-Grahapaka\" was the elected \"collector of votes\" in the Santhagara \"general assembly hall used for voting\". The Jain cosmological term \"salakapurusa\" \"illustrious or worthy person\" compounds \"salaka\" \"stick used for voting\" and \"purusa\" \"person\".\n\n\"Chou\" 籌 originally meant \"arrow used in \"tóuhú\" (ancient drinking game decided by the number of arrows thrown into a pot)\" or \"tally stick (used in counting)\", and by extension came to mean \"plan; prepare; collect\" (Karlgren 1957: 281). \"Chóu\" 籌 \"shit stick\" was first chronicled around the 3rd century CE. The Jin dynasty (265–420) \"Yulin\" 語林 by Pei Qi 裴啟 has stories about the especially ostentatious bathrooms of wealthy merchant Shi Chong 石崇 (249–300) (see Needham 1970:373), including one about Shi mocking the politician Liu Shi 劉寔 (220–310) for being unfamiliar with the perfumed shit sticks offered by two female washroom attendants (\"Hanyu Da Zidian\" 1989 8:1272).\n\n\"Cèchóu\" 廁籌 was first recorded in the (c. 659) \"History of the Northern Dynasties\", when Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (r. 550–560) said that getting Yang Yin to serve as Prime Minister was a difficult as making him present shit sticks (\"Hanyu Da Cidian\" 1993 3: 1251).\n\nThe \"Nihon Kokugo Daijiten\" (2001) defines \"chūgi\" 籌木 or \"chū\" 籌 as \"chips of wood anciently used instead of toilet paper\", and cites the earliest recorded usage of \"chūgi\" ちうぎ in Ono Ranzan's 小野蘭山 (1847) \"Jūtei honzō kōmoku keimō\" 重訂本草綱目啓蒙 \"Illuminated Compendium of Materia Medica\". Modern Japanese dialect pronunciations of \"chūgi\" include \"chyōi\" or \"chūge\" in Hida (region) and \"tsū\" in Iwate Prefecture.\n\nTranslations in English dictionaries of Buddhism include:\n\nChinese \"jué\" or Japanese \"ketsu\" 橛 \"short wooden stake; stick; peg; post\" is compounded with \"shi\" or \"shǐ\" 屎 (written with 尸 \"body\" and 米 \"rice\") \"shit; excrement; dung\" into Japanese \"shiketsu\" or Chinese \"shǐjué\" 屎橛 \"shit stick\". \n\nThe famous term \"gānshǐjué\" or \"kanshiketsu\" 乾屎橛 \"dry shit stick\", modified with \"gān\" or \"kan\" 乾 \"dry, dried; hollow\", occurs in a famous Chan \"gōng'àn\" or Zen \"kōan\" recorded in \"The Gateless Gate\" (see below). \n\nDefinitions in English dictionaries of Buddhism include:\n\nChinese \"bì\" 箆 \"fine-tooth comb; spatula\" or Japanese \"hera\" 箆 \"spatula; scoop\" is compounded into Chinese \"cèbì \" 廁箆 \"toilet spatula\" and Japanese \"kusobera\" 糞箆 \"shit spatula\" or \"kusokakibera\" 糞掻く篦 \"shit scratching spatula\". While most Japanese \"shit stick\" words have Sino-Japanese \"on'yomi\" readings, such as \"chūgi\" from \"chóumù\" 籌木, both \"kuso\" 糞 \"shit; crap\" (cf. internet slang \"kuso\") and \"hera\" 箆 \"spatula; scoop\" are native Japanese \"kun'yomi\" pronunciations of these kanji (which would be read \"funhei\" 糞箆 in Sino-Japanese).\n\nChinese \"cebi\" 廁箆 \"toilet spatula\" is first recorded in Buddhabhadra's (c. 419) \"Mohe sengqi lü\" 摩訶僧祇律 translation of the Mahāsāṃghika version \"Vinaya Pitaka\" monastic rules; the toilet etiquette section (明威儀法之一) says inside toilets should have privacy partitions, with \"cebi\" shit-sticks placed at the side (\"Hanyu Da Cidian\" 1993 3: 1251).\n\nChinese \"cèjiǎn\" 廁簡 or 厕简 \"toilet stick\" is a synonym of \"cèchóu\" 廁籌 (above) using the word \"jiǎn\" 簡 \"bamboo and wooden slips used for writing; letter; select; choose; simple; brief\". \"Cèjiǎn\" was first recorded in the (c. 1105) \"Book of Southern Tang\" \"Biographies of Buddhists\" section. During the time of Queen Zhou the Elder (r. 961–964), a monk used a sharpened toilet stick to remove a tumor (\"Hanyu Da Cidian\" 1993 3: 1251). Jabamukhi salaka (also from Sanskrit \"śalākā\") was \"a curved needle (used in traditional Indian cataract surgery)\".\n\nThe English language has some \"shit(e) stick\" lexical parallels to these Asian language terms. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (s.v. shit, shite n.) quotes two early \"shit-stick\" examples: \"a hard chuffe, a shite-sticks\" (1598) and \"a shite-sticks, a shite-rags, that is to say, a miserable pinch-pennie\" (1659); and (s.v. poop n.) defines poop-stick as \"a fool, ineffectual person\", with the earliest usage in 1930. \"Shit-sticks\" is metaphorically parallel to \"shit-rags\" (Doyle 1994: 96). In modern usage, Atcheson L. Hench (Hench et al. 1964: 298) suggests calling someone a \"shit-stick\" may combine the ideas of \"shit\" and \"stick-in-the-mud\".\n\nThe lexicographer Eric Partridge (2006: 1726–1727) lists three slang terms.\n\nWords meaning \"shit stick\" are associated with the Chan/Zen school of Buddhism. Victor Mair (2008: 107) explains that most great masters in this school \"did not directly state what they wanted to say, but used a conclusive shout or a knock on the head with a rod, or yet spoke such words as 'dry shit stick' that are situated somewhere between comprehensibility and incomprehensibility in order to make a suggestion that would enable their students to partake of enlightenment\".\n\n\"The Gateless Gate\" is the Song dynasty Chan master Wumen Huikai's (c. 1228) compilation of 48 kōans. Case 21 is titled \"Yunmen (kan)shiketsu\" 雲門(乾)屎橛\" \"Master Yunmen's (Dried) Shit Stick\", referring to the Tang dynasty Chan master Yunmen Wenyan (c. 862–949 CE).\n\nAitken (1999: 139) explains \"dried shitstick\" as \"a soft stick that was used the way our ancestors used a corncob in their outhouses\". Jack Kerouac (1958: 173) paraphrased \"The Buddha is a dried piece of turd\".\n\nOwing to the ambiguities of Classical Chinese, the word \"gānshǐjué\" or \"kanshiketsu\" 乾屎橛 can be parsed as \"dried shit-stick\" or \"dried-shit stick\". English translations include:\nSekida and Grimstone note: \"\"Kanshiketsu\". A \"shiketsu\", or 'shit-stick' (\"kan\", dry; \"shi\", shit; \"ketsu\", stick), was used in old times instead of toilet paper. It is at once both private and polluted. But in samadhi there is no private or public, no pure or polluted.\"\n\nThe \"Línjì lù\" or \"Rinzai roku\" 臨濟錄 \"Record of Linji\" contains the compiled sayings of the Tang dynasty Chan master Linji Yixuan or Rinzai Gigen (d. 866 CE). In one famous example of so-called dharma combat, Linji uses the word \"ganshijue\" as an epithet, comparable to \"You shithead!\" (Aitken 1999: 139). \n\nIn an editorial note, Kirchner (2009: 131) says Ruth Fuller Sasaki originally translated Chinese \"ganshijue\" 乾屎橛 as \"shit-wiping stick\", saying that the term literally means a \"cleaning-off-dung-stick\", a smooth stick of bamboo used in place of toilet paper, with 乾 being the verb \"to clean\". However, Sasaki changed this to \"dried piece of shit\", following the interpretation of Iriya Yoshitaka (1989: 21), an authority on Tang-dynasty slang, that it means \"stick-shaped piece of dung\". A comparable usage occurs in the record of Song dynasty Chan master Dahui Zonggao, \"Dahui Pujue Chanshi yulu\" 大慧普覺禪師語錄, where the two characters 屎麼 form a noun-compound: \"I say to [such stupid monks], 'You're biting on the dung-sticks of others. You’re not even good dogs!'.\" Sasaki’s other collaborator, Yanagida Seizan (1977: 52), interprets the term 乾屎橛 to mean \"useless dung stick\", explaining that 乾 does not have its usual meaning of \"dry\", but is synonymous with the homophonous 閑 \"useless\".\n\nThích Nhất Hạnh comments, \n\n\n"}

As suggested by its name, red tortoise cakes are traditionally red in color and has a sticky chewy texture when eaten.\nRed tortoise cakes are shaped like tortoise shells because the Chinese traditionally believed that eating tortoises would bring longevity to those who are eating it and bring about good fortune and prosperity.\nConsidered to be auspicious items, these sweet pastries are especially prepared during important festivals such as Chinese New Year as offerings to the Chinese deities.\n\nRed tortoise cakes are also prepared for occasions that are culturally important to the Chinese such as a newborn baby's first month or birthdays of the elderly. Eating red tortoise cakes during these times is meant to represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elderly. In modern times, red tortoise cakes continue to be important food items during Chinese festivals in many countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Taiwan and southern Thailand provinces such as Phuket,Phang-Nga and Trang. However, eating red tortoise cakes in these countries is no longer restricted to special occasions for red tortoise cakes are also commercially available in many pastry shops and bakeries.\n\nThere are two main components in red tortoise cakes, the skin and the filling. The skin is made mostly from glutinous rice flour and sweet potato whereas the fillings are made from precooked ingredients such as mung bean or ground peanuts and sugar. After kneading and molding the ingredients together, the red tortoise cakes are steamed on a piece of banana leaf. In countries such as Singapore, these pastries are popular snack items and are especially popular with children because of their sweet and savory taste. In fact, many bakeries in Singapore have created red tortoise cakes in a variety of assorted flavors, including jelly and red bean, to cater to all tastes and preferences.\n\nIn Chinese culture, the color red is traditionally used as a symbol of joy and happiness whereas the tortoise symbolizes longevity, power and tenacity.\nAs such, red tortoise cakes are of a high cultural significance and value amongst the Chinese people. They are typically associated with auspicious occasions and are especially prepared during birthdays and religious festivals to symbolize blessings and good fortune.\n\nChinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture as it represents the start of a new year for everyone where people could reconcile and welcome the new year in hope for peace and prosperity. During this festival, the Chinese people would pray for good fortune and sweets such as rice cakes and red tortoise cakes are offered to the Chinese deities on ritual altars. These ritual offerings are made in the hope that the sweetness from these cakes will leave a sweet taste in the mouths of the deities and they will bless the people with a prosperous year ahead.\n\nThe Jade Emperor is one of the most important gods in chinese folklore. He is believed to be the ruler of heaven and his birthday falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month. To celebrate his birthday, the Chinese people will conduct prayers in his name and prepare food within Chinese temples or Chinese households as ritual offerings. In Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are considered must-haves amongst the food items that are to be offered to the Jade Emperor on altar tables.\n\nBecause the number 6 is considered an auspicious number in Chinese culture, red tortoise cakes are placed on the altar table in multiples of six such as 12, 24 or 36 in the hope that he will bless the people with good fortune and prosperity.\n\nQing Ming Festival is the time for the Chinese to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors to pay their respects. Prayers are conducted to honor the ancestors and food items such as red tortoise cakes are prepared as offerings. However, there is some difference in the red tortoise cakes that are prepared for this occasion. Apart from the usual red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the color red, there are separate red tortoise cakes that are prepared in the colors green or white. The reason for these differences in color between red tortoise cakes is that these colors are of cultural significance to the Chinese people. The color red is representative of the virtuous life led by the ancestors whereas the colors green and white embody the descendants' grief and their hope that their ancestors are coping well in the afterlife.\n\nQi Xi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month on the Chinese calendar. Also known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, the Qi Xi Festival is traditionally a time for young maidens to make wishes for a good husband. When a teenage girl reaches her sixteenth birthday, red tortoise cakes are prepared within the respective households and then handed out to close friends and neighbors. The symbolic act of handing out red tortoise cakes on this day signifies that one's daughter has reached maturity and is of a marriageable age. However, this practice is seldom carried out these days due to a change in cultural thoughts and beliefs amongst modern Chinese.\n\nIn Chinese culture, birthdays are of greater significance after one reaches the age of 60.\nRed tortoise cakes are prepared especially for such occasions when celebrating the birthdays of the elders in the family. The number of red tortoise cakes that are prepared corresponds to the age of the elder who is celebrating his or her birthday by an additional twelve. For example, if an elder is celebrating his 65th birthday, there will be 77 red tortoise cakes prepared to celebrate his or her birthday. The cultural significance of preparing these red tortoise cakes is to count one's blessings for having lived thus far and it is hoped that the additional 12 red tortoise cakes would increase one's lifespan, bringing longevity and good fortune in the process.\n\nAccording to Chinese custom, when a baby turns one month old, a ceremony is held to celebrate his/her first month of life (the Chinese term translates as \"full moon\").\nRed tortoise cakes are traditionally distributed to friends and relatives during this time to symbolize luck, blessings and long life for the child.\n\nIn Hokkien tradition, the design on top of the \"ang ku kueh\" will signify the sex of the child. A turtle and two marbles is the sign for a boy while a girl is represented by two peaches. Nowadays, to simplify things, a ‘pointed’ \"ang ku kueh\" signifies a boy while a ‘flat’ one a girl. These tortoise cakes are sometimes made larger than usual in the hope that the child will grow up big and healthy.\n\nTraditionally prepared during significant occasions such as festivals or birthdays, red tortoise cakes have become popular among many people who favor them as a delicious snack. Though many Chinese families these days continue to prepare red tortoise cakes within the household for special occasions, red tortoise cakes are available for sale all year in many bakeries and Chinese pastry shops. Because preparing red tortoise cakes is a time consuming process, some Chinese families in modern cities such as Singapore have replaced making these red tortoise cakes at home with store-bought alternatives. Pastry chefs continue to introduce innovative interpretations of this traditional pastry into the market every year, appealing to consumers who enjoy the novelty of tasting these red tortoise cakes in assorted flavors.\n\nThe skin of the red tortoise cake is made from glutinous rice flour dough, mashed sweet potato, water, food coloring, sugar, oil and wheat starch. Traditionally, fillings for red tortoise cakes are made with the following ingredients: mung bean paste or grounded peanuts, sugar and oil. The fillings are then placed within the dough and the tortoise shell design imprinted on the skin's surface using molds before the red tortoise cakes are steamed over a piece of banana leaf. The banana leaves enable the steam to penetrate the red tortoise cake that is resting on top and exudes a sweet fragrance when steamed.\nA good red tortoise cake is one where the skin does not stick to the teeth and exudes a sweet fragrance coupled with a soft chewy texture.\n\nRed tortoise cakes are traditionally made by:\n\nRed tortoise cake molds are an important tool when making red tortoise cakes. Apart from molding the red tortoise cakes into perfectly round or oval shapes, these molds are also used to imprint patterns onto the surfaces of the red tortoise cakes. Usually carved out of wood or molded from plastics, there are many different types of red tortoise cake molds available on the market. There are also red tortoise molds that create floral patterns instead of the tortoise shell pattern seen on traditional red tortoise cakes. These molds are used to enhance the aesthetic value of red tortoise cakes and there is no cultural significance attached to the differing designs on these molds.\n\nMany bakeries and pastry shops have added new twists to the traditional red tortoise cake and found ways to introduce innovative and creative variants of this pastry. In Singapore, apart from the usual fillings of peanut or mung bean paste, there are now red tortoise cakes filled with exotic flavors such as durian and coconut amongst many others. Catered to suit all tastes and preferences, these new products on the market bear testament to the popularity of red tortoise cakes among consumers.\n\nAmong the Peranakans it is known as \"Kueh Ku\" or \"Ang Ku Kueh\". The black variant is known as \"Kueh Ku Hitam\".\n\nThough it looks exactly like the traditional red tortoise cake physically, jelly red tortoise cake is significantly different from its traditional counterpart. Instead of a skin that is made from glutinous rice flour, jelly red tortoise cakes have skins that are made of sweetened gelatin. The gelatin mixture along with fillings such as cream or custard are poured into plastic moulds and then refrigerated to enable the gelatin mixture to set and harden. These jelly red tortoise cakes are served chilled and presented on green plastic strips instead of traditional banana leaves. They are especially popular among children who view these cakes as a delicious treat and enjoy the jelly red tortoise cakes for its refreshing sweetness.\n\n"}

It is very similar to that of neighboring countries in west Africa. Common staple foods include grains and tubers. Côte d'Ivoire is one of the largest cocoa producers in the world and also produces palm oil and coffee.\n\nCassava and plantains are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A corn paste called \"aitiu\" is used to prepare corn balls, and peanuts are widely used in dishes.

It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the custard producing a cool center.\nThe custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla, but can have a variety of other flavorings.\n\nThe earliest known recipe for \"crème brûlée\" appears in François Massialot's 1691 cookbook \"Cuisinier royal et bourgeois\". The name \"\"burnt cream\"\" was used in the 1702 English translation. In 1740 Massialot referred to a similar recipe as \"crême à l'Angloise; 'English cream'. \"\n\nThe dish then vanished from French cookbooks until the 1980s.\nA version of \"crème brûlée\" (known locally as \"Trinity Cream\" or \"Cambridge burnt cream\") was introduced at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1879 with the college arms \"impressed on top of the cream with a branding iron\"'.\n\n\"Crème brûlée\" was not very common in French and English cookbooks of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It became extremely popular in the 1980s, \"\"a symbol of that decade's self-indulgence and the darling of the restaurant boom\"\", probably popularized by Sirio Maccioni at his New York restaurant \"Le Cirque\". He claimed to have made it \"\"the most famous and by far the most popular dessert in restaurants from Paris to Peoria\"\".\n\n\"Crème brûlée\" is usually served in individual ramekins. Discs of caramel may be prepared separately and put on top just before serving, or the caramel may be formed directly on top of the custard immediately before serving. To do this, sugar is sprinkled onto the custard, then caramelized under a salamander broiler or with a butane torch.\nTwo styles exist to make crème brûlée. The common format is to create a \"hot\" custard, traditionally by whisking egg yolks in a double boiler with sugar and incorporate the cream, with vanilla following once the custard is off the heat. Likewise, this can be achieved by tempering the egg yolk/sugar mixture with hot cream, then adding vanilla at the end. There also exists a \"cold\" method, wherein the egg yolks and sugar are whisked together until the mixture reaches ribbon stage. Then, cold heavy cream is whisked into the yolk mixture followed by vanilla. After the custard is achieved, the mixture is dished into ramekins and the ramekins are placed into a bain-marie. Hot/boiling water is poured into the large pan holding the ramekins until it reaches halfway up the sides; the pan is then placed into an oven until the custard center is jiggly and the edges set. Pulling the crème brûlée out at this point ensures a creamy dessert.\n\nIn Catalan cuisine, \"crema catalana\" (\"Catalan cream\") or \"crema cremada\" (\"Burnt cream\"), is a dish \"virtually identical\" to \"crème brûlée\"; The first known recipe for \"crema catalana\" appears in the Catalan cookbooks \"Llibre de Sent Soví\" (14th century) and \"Llibre del Coch\" (16th century). three centuries before the French came up with crème brûlée. The recipe included a custard cream, over which sugar was poured and subsequently burnt with a hot iron rod, creating the characteristic burnt crust. Some differences include the cooking method and subsequent consistency; the French give aroma with cream and vanilla, while the Catalan do so with milk, cinnamon and lemon zest. \n\nAnalogous recipes appear in 17th century Spanish cookery books, usually under the name of \"Cream of Saint Joseph\" (\"Crema de san José\"), since it was a traditional dessert served during Saint Joseph's Day, although nowadays it is consumed at all times of the year. The burnt sugar topping is documented in 1770. The recipe was referred to as \"crema catalana\" (Catalan cream) for the first time by the Spanish friar Juan de Altamiras in his 1745 cookbook, where the recipe was said to be of Catalan origin. However, there are claims that Juan de Altamiras got his recipe during his stay in the Portuguese city of Monsaraz, Alentejo in his youth.\n\n\n\n"}

It is characterized by a low yeast content and a very wet dough. Some recipes improve the quality of the crust by baking the bread in a Dutch oven or other covered vessel.\n\nAccording to one version of the method developed by New York baker Jim Lahey, as described in his book \"My Bread\", one loaf of the bread is made by mixing 400 g (approximately 3 cups) bread flour, 8 g (approximately 1¼ teaspoons) salt and 1 g (approximately ¼ teaspoon) instant yeast with 300 mL (approximately 1 1/3 cups) cool water to produce a 75% hydration dough.\n\nThe dough is allowed to rise, covered, for 12 to 18 hours until doubled in size and covered with bubbles, then scraped onto a floured surface, given a few folds, shaped, then allowed to rise, covered, for another hour or two. It is then dropped in a pot that has been preheated in an oven at . The bread is baked in the covered pot for 30 minutes and, with the lid removed, for another 15 to 30 minutes until the crust is a deep brown, then removed from the pot and allowed to cool for an hour.\n\nThe method uses a long rise instead of kneading to align the dough's gluten molecules with each other so as to produce a strong, elastic network, resulting in long, sticky strands. The automatic alignment is possible because of the wetness of the dough, which makes the molecules more mobile. Wet doughs, which use a water weight of about 75% that of the flour (hydration), require more salt than conventional doughs, about 2% of the flour weight.\n\nAlthough no-knead bread was thought to have been first described in the 1999 cookbook \"No Need to Knead\", written by California baker Suzanne Dunaway and published by Hyperion Books, author Jeff Hertzberg notes such a method before the late 1990s in Italy. One reviewer described Dunaway's cookbook as \"a book that doesn’t care about kneading and still produces fantastic results!\" Due to the popularity of her no-knead method, Dunaway's book was re-published in 2012 by Grub Street Cookery. In addition, famed gospel composer and song collector Albert E. Brumley published a recipe for \"No-Knead Bread\" in his 1972 song collection and cookbook, \"All-Day Singin' and Dinner on the Ground\", with a similar baking and rising process.\n\nIn 2007, Hertzberg and fellow author Zoe François published \"Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day, \"which uses a no-knead method of stored and refrigerated dough that is ready for use at any time during a 5- to 14-day period.\n\n\"New York Times\" food columnist Mark Bittman described Lahey's method in his November 8, 2006 column \"The Minimalist\". Bittman praised the bread for its \"great crumb, lightness, incredible flavor [and] enviable, crackling crust.\" Two years later, he noted the recipe's \"immediate and wild popularity,\" and a 2009 cookbook described Bittman's column as \"one of those recipes that literally change the culinary scene with discussions on hundreds of blogs in dozens of languages around the world.\"\n"}

The café sells about 10,000 sheep's heads a year, according to its chef.\n\nWhen eating svið, the ears are sometimes considered taboo due to the superstitious belief that when they (bearing the mark of the animal's owner) are removed, the eater will be accused of theft. It is sometimes held that if the little bone underneath the tongue is not broken, a child that cannot yet speak will remain silent forever. Many Icelanders consider the eye to be the best part of the head.\n\nLara Weber, writing in the \"Chicago Tribune\", described her experience of eating svið in a 1995 article on Icelandic cuisine:\n\nSvið is prepared by first burning off the hair, then cleaning the head under running cold water while paying special attention to the eyes and ears.

When it is ready for cooking, it is put into a cooking pot, sprinkled with coarse salt and partly covered with water. When the water boils, the scum is skimmed off. The head can then be cooked covered for 60 to 90 minutes, until the flesh is cooked through but before it has begun to separate from the bone.

There have been significant improvements and advances during the last century in food preservation, storage, shipping and production, and today many countries, cities and regions have access to their traditional cuisines and many other global cuisines.\n\nJapanese cuisine has spread throughout the world, and representative dishes such as sushi and ramen, among others are popular. In many cases, Japanese food is adapted and reinvented to fit the taste buds of the local populace. For instance, the California roll is a popular dish in the United States that is a modification of the Japanese makizushi, a type of sushi. In South Korea, both the Japanese curry and the ramen have been imported and popularized primarily in the form of instant food. Tonkatsu and tempura, which are derived from Western food, are now considered and marketed as uniquely Japanese, as well as the Japanese curry, which derived from the Indian curry.\n\nIn many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, and Brazil, Japanese restaurants have become popular.

In recent years, connoisseurs of Chinese cuisine have also sprouted in Eastern Europe and South Asia. American Chinese cuisine and Canadian Chinese food are popular examples of local varieties. Local ingredients would be adopted while maintaining the style and preparation technique.\n\nTraditional Chinese cuisines include Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Szechuan, and Zhejiang, all of which are defined and termed per the respective regions within China where they developed. These regional cuisines are sometimes referred to as the \"eight culinary traditions of China.\" A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine, but perhaps the best known and most influential are the Szechuan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong cuisines. These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources, climate, geography, history, cooking techniques and lifestyle. Many Chinese traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of food preservation such as drying, salting, pickling and fermentation.\n\nIndian cuisine has contributed to shaping the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also had the created influence on international cuisines, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles and the Caribbean. The use of Indian spices, herbs and vegetable produce have helped shaped the cuisines of many countries around the world.\n\nIndian cuisine consists of the foods and dishes of India (and to some extent neighboring countries), is characterized by the extensive use of various Indian spices and vegetables grown across India, herbs, vegetables and fruits, and is also known for the widespread practice of vegetarianism in Indian society. Indian regional cuisine is primarily categorized at the regional level, but also at provincial levels. Cuisine differences derive from various local cultures, geographical locations (whether a region is close to the sea, desert or the mountains), and economics. Indian cuisine is also seasonal, and utilizes fresh produce.\n\nThe cuisine of India is very diverse with each state having an entirely different food platter. The development of these cuisines have been shaped by Hindu and Jain beliefs, in particular vegetarianism which is a common dietary trend in Indian society. There has also been Islamic influence from the years of Mughal and Delhi Sultanate rule, as well as Persian interactions on North Indian and Deccani cuisine. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies. Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played an important role in introducing certain food types and eating habits to the country. For instance, potato, a staple of North Indian diet was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chiles and breadfruit among other things. Spices were bought from India and traded in exchange for rubber and opium from Malacca.

European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.

Spices such as garlic are also frequently seen.\n\n\"Funge\" (or \"funje\", ) and \"pirão\" () are very common dishes, and in poorer households often consumed at every meal. The dish is often eaten with fish, pork, chicken, or beans. \"Funge de bombo\" (), more common in northern Angola, is a paste or porridge of cassava (also called manioc or yuca), made from cassava flour. It is gelatinous in consistency and gray in color. \"Pirão\", yellow in color and similar to polenta, is made from cornflour and is more common in the south. \"Fuba\" () is the term for the flour that is used to make either \"funge\" and \"pirão\", also used to make \"angu\", the Brazilian polenta.

The cocktail shares a name with Hemingway's book \"Death in the Afternoon\", and the recipe was published in \"So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon\", 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. Hemingway's original instructions were:\n\"Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.\"\nIt is claimed that the cocktail was invented by Hemingway after he spent time in the Left Bank, Paris, and enjoyed the absinthe there. The original printed recipe for the drink claimed that it was invented \"by the author and three officers of H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders’ fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W. gale.\" Death in the Afternoon is known for both its decadence and its high strength.\n\nThere are a number of alternative ways to produce Death in the Afternoon. The absinthe can be added to the glass after the Champagne, as some brands of absinthe will float on the Champagne for a short time. Other alternatives have arisen because of the difficulty of acquiring absinthe; the absinthe can be replaced with Absente, an alternative to absinthe available where it is illegal, or a strong pastis, such as Pernod. Variants which use an alternative to absinthe are sometimes given a different name, but are also sometimes still referred to as Death in the Afternoon. Some recipes direct the person making the cocktail to use ingredients in addition to the Champagne and absinthe; Valerie Mellma recommends that a sugar cube and several dashes of bitters be added to the glass prior to the main ingredients.\n\nThe cocktail is milky in appearance on account of the spontaneous emulsification of the absinthe (or substitute), and bubbly, which it takes from the Champagne. After the first sip, however, it becomes significantly less bubbly. Harold McGee, dining and wine writer for \"The New York Times\", said that it \"seemed a waste of effervescence\" (though substituting Pernod for the absinthe).\n\n"}

About half of them were bought for $40 each; for each ball purchased, another is given away. The ball has been spread by numerous organizations and made its way to over 140 countries.\n\nThe One World Futbol was conceived by Tim Jahnigen of Berkeley, California after he watched a documentary that featured children in Darfur playing with soccer balls made of trash. These makeshift balls were used because traditional soccer balls rapidly became too damaged to be usable in the rocky ground that the children played in. Jahnigen, who had previously met the developers of Crocs shoes and had used durable early Crocs prototypes, came up with the idea of using ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, a similar material, to create the ball. The ball self re-inflates, eliminating the need for air pumps, can still be used after being punctured, and can withstand heat and cold.\n\nJahnigen did not immediately pursue the idea, as he did not have the funding to do so. He brought up the idea while speaking with the musician Sting, who gave Jahnigen research and development funding for the ball. As a result of the support, the ball itself was named after The Police song \"One World\".\n\nThe One World Play Project, responsible for manufacturing, selling, and donating the balls, was founded as a certified Benefit corporation in July 2010 before the final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

{"id": "32506147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32506147", "title": "Ichthyoplankton", "text": "Ichthyoplankton\n\nIchthyoplankton (from Greek: ἰχθύς, \"ikhthus\", \"fish\"; and πλαγκτός, \"planktos\", \"drifter\") are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are mostly found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. Ichthyoplankton are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with the ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into juveniles. Fish larvae are part of the zooplankton that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their own food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals.\n\nFish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. Fish eggs typically have a diameter of about . The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment) and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.\n\nIchthyoplankton can be a useful indicator of the state and health of an aquatic ecosystem. For instance, most late stage larvae in ichthyoplankton have usually been preyed on, so ichthyoplankton tends to be dominated by eggs and early stage larvae. This means that when fish, such as anchovies and sardines, are spawning, ichthyoplankton samples can reflect their spawning output and provide an\nindex of relative population size for the fish. Increases or decreases in the number of adult fish stocks can be detected more rapidly and sensitively by monitoring the ichthyoplankton associated with them, compared to monitoring the adults themselves. It is also usually easier and more cost effective to sample trends in egg and larva populations than to sample trends in adult fish populations.\n\nInterest in plankton originated in Britain and Germany in the nineteenth century when researchers discovered there were microorganisms in the sea, and that they could trap them with fine-mesh nets. They started describing these microorganisms and testing different net configurations. Ichthyoplankton research started in 1864 when the Norwegian government commissioned the marine biologist G. O. Sars to investigate fisheries around the Norwegian coast. Sars found fish eggs, particularly cod eggs, drifting in the water. This established that fish eggs could be pelagic, living in the open water column like other plankton. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, research interest in ichthyoplankton became more general when it emerged that, if ichthyoplankton was sampled quantitatively, then the samples could indicate the relative size or abundance of spawning fish stocks.\n\nResearch vessels collect ichthyoplankton from the ocean using fine mesh nets. The vessels either tow the nets through the sea or pump sea water onboard and then pass it through the net.\n\n\n\nIchthyoplankton researchers generally use the terminology and development stages introduced in 1984 by Kendall and others. This consists of three main developmental stages and two transitional stages.\n\nRecruitment of fish is regulated by larval fish survival. Survival is regulated by prey abundance, predation, and hydrology. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms. For example, they may be fed upon by marine invertebrates, such as copepods, arrow worms, jellyfish, amphipods, marine snails and krill. Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates. Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, haddock were observed satiating themselves with herring eggs back in 1922. Another study found cod in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production. Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern anchovy (\"Engraulis mordax\") were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population, while Peruvian anchoveta were responsible for 10% and South African anchovy (\"Engraulis encrasicolus\") 70%.\n\nThe most effective predators are about ten times as long as the larvae they prey on. This is true regardless of whether the predator is a crustacean, a jellyfish, or a fish.\n\nFish larvae develop first an ability to swim up and down the water column for short distances. Later they develop an ability to swim horizontally for much longer distances. These swimming developments affect their dispersal.\n\nIn 2010, a group of scientists reported that fish larvae can drift on ocean currents and reseed fish stocks at a distant location. This finding demonstrates, for the first time, what scientists have long suspected but have never proven, that fish populations can be connected to distant populations through the process of larval drift.\n\nThe fish they chose to investigate was the yellow tang, because when a larva of this fish find a suitable reef it stays in the general area for the rest of its life. Thus, it is only as drifting larvae that the fish can migrate significant distances from where they are born. The tropical yellow tang is much sought after by the aquarium trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing, so in an attempt to save them nine marine protected areas (MPAs) were established off the coast of Hawaii. Now, through the process of larval drift, fish from the MPAs are establishing themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering. \"We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away,\" said one of the authors, the marine biologist Mark Hixon. \"This is a direct observation, not just a model, that successful marine reserves can sustain fisheries beyond their borders.\"\n\n\n"}

The local pastry chefs are credited for helping to preserve the larks by creating the new, sweet version of Leipziger Lerche shortly after the hunting ban was imposed.\n\nToday's version consists of a shortcrust filled with a mixture of crushed almonds, nuts and a cherry. The cherry symbolises the heart of the bird. It is topped with a grid of two crossed dough strips. The term \"Leipziger Lerche\" has been protected by the Saxonian Bakery Guild since 1998.\n"}

Popular in the U.K. with much argued regional variations in naming, such as \"bacon sarnie\", \"bacon butty/buttie\" \"bacon bap\", \"bacon barm\" or \"bacon cob\". Most often served with brown sauce or tomato ketchup.\n\nA bacon sandwich (also known in the UK as a bacon sarnie, bacon butty/buttie, bacon bap, bacon barm or bacon cob and as a bacon sanger or piece 'n bacon in Scotland) is a form of sandwich made from cooked bacon between two slices of bread, usually buttered. Often some form of sauce, such as mayonnaise, tomato ketchup or brown sauce, is included.\nAngels on horseback is a hot appetizer made of oysters wrapped with bacon. In the United Kingdom they can also be a savoury, the final course of a traditional British formal meal. They are somewhat similar to Devils on horseback and the Midwestern version of pigs in a blanket, a traditional dish of the American Midwest. Scallops wrapped in bacon appears to be a variation on this dish.\n\nStrictly speaking angels on horseback (and the original UK form of pigs in a blanket) are an hors d'œuvre, unlike the US variant of pigs in a blanket, which are canapés, since the latter always involve a bread base or wrapping, and angels on horseback are not by necessity served on toast.\nDevils on horseback are a hot appetizer or savoury.\n\nRecipes vary but in general they are a variation on angels on horseback, made by replacing oysters with dried fruit. The majority of recipes contain a pitted prune (though dates are sometimes used) stuffed with mango chutney and wrapped in bacon. This is then baked in the oven and quite often served on toast, with watercress. \n\nOther recipes stuff the prune with cheese, almonds, smoked oysters or other things in place of the mango chutney. Other versions again use liver pieces in place of the prunes. \n\nDevils on horseback are commonly served as part of a Christmas feast.\nA Double Down is a sandwich offered by Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). The Double Down contains \"bacon, two different kinds of melted cheese, the Colonel’s 'secret' sauce... pinched in between two pieces of Original Recipe chicken fillets.\" It is also available with grilled chicken fillets instead of the Original Recipe fried fillets. The KFC Double Down was initially test marketed in Omaha, Nebraska and Providence, Rhode Island. KFC describes the Double Down as a \"sandwich\" although it does not have bread.\n\nFool's Gold Loaf is a sandwich made by the Colorado Mine Company, a five-star restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The name of the sandwich is derived from its price of $49.95. In later years, it was priced closer to $100 for the sandwich and a bottle of Dom Pérignon.\nHangtown fry is a type of omelette made famous during the California Gold Rush in the 1850s. The most common version includes bacon and oysters combined with eggs, and fried together.\nThe dish was invented in Placerville, California, then known as Hangtown. According to most accounts, the dish was invented when a gold prospector struck it rich, headed to the Cary House Hotel, and demanded the most expensive dish that the kitchen could provide. The most expensive ingredients available were eggs, which were delicate and had to be carefully brought to the mining town; bacon, which was shipped from the East Coast, and oysters, which had to be brought on ice from San Francisco, over 100 miles away.\n\nThe Baconator sandwich is a hamburger sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Wendy's. It is one of their late-teen–to–young-adult oriented products.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the hamburger consisted of two 4oz. beef patties, two slices of American cheese, six strips of bacon, mayonnaise, and ketchup on a bun. The sandwich was layered so that there were three strips of bacon on top of each patty. In 2009, Wendy's began offering three different varieties of the Baconator- the Baconator Single (one patty), the Baconator Double (the same as the original), and the Baconator Triple (three patties). At various times Wendy's has offered special limited-time only Baconators such as the Spicy Baconator, which added pepper jack cheese, jalapeños, and \"Chipotle Ranch\" sauce.\n"}

However, it is believed that dish was originated from Klego district in Boyolali, Central Java.\n\nThe term \"tongseng\" derived from Javanese term \"osengan\" which refer to \"stir frying\" to describes its cooking method. It also refer to the \"\"seng\"\" friction sounds of metal frying spoon against metal wok.\n\nThe soup is made of ground mixture of garlic, shallot, black pepper, ginger, coriander, galangal, \"daun salam\" (Indonesian bay leaves), and lemongrass sauteed with palm oil until it gets aromatic. The diced meat then poured into the sauteed mixture until cooked. Usually the uncooked goat meat from \"sate kambing\" (goat satay) are used. Add water until it boiled and add sweet soy sauce with tamarind juice. After the boiled mixture reduces, shredded cabbages and sliced tomato are add to add fresh and crisp texture. Some versions are prepared using coconut milk. Slices of bird's eye chili might be added for those who prefers extra hot and spicy \"tongseng\" soup.\n\n\"Tongseng\" is usually served with hot steamed rice. The soup of \"tongseng\" is similar to \"gulai\" soup, however \"gulai\" is cooked without sweet soy sauce while \"tongseng\" mostly appears in brownish gold colour because of the addition of sweet soy sauce. \"Gulai\" usually uses beef's offal while \"tongseng\" usually only uses meat (goat, lamb, mutton or beef).\n\nTraditionally, \"tongseng\" is considered as the merge between goat satay and \"gulai\" spicy soup. According to Indonesian culinary expert, \"tongseng\" started to appear in Java between the 18th to 19th century CE. At that time, during colonial era, there were significant influx of Arabs and Muslim Indians migrated into Indonesian archipelago. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Java. Among others are \"sate kambing\", which was believed to be the local adaptation of Indian-Muslim kebabs and \"gulai\", which was a local adaptation of curry-based soup probably influenced by Indian cuisine.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the southern area of Central Java was developed as sugar plantation, thus sugar mills were built. Next to common sugar, traditional Javanese palm sugar (\"gula jawa\") were also produced in the region. Soy sauce factory also built in the region, as the result local Javanese developed \"kecap manis\", which is sweet soy sauce made of a mixture of soy sauce and palm sugar. This sweet soy sauce become the main sauce that combine the savoury \"gulai\" soup with pieces of goat satay and the fresh crisp of cabbages and tomato.\n\nToday, \"tongseng\" is a common dish in Javanese cities of Boyolali, Surakarta (Solo), Klaten, and Yogyakarta, thus most of \"tongseng\" sellers hailed from those towns. The dish is also can be found in Indonesian major cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya. \"Tongseng\" sellers usually marketed themselves as \"Warung Sate Solo\", a \"warung\" or small modest restaurant that specialized in offering satay, \"tongseng\" and \"gulai\" as their main fare. \n\n"}

It is popular among the Arab community in Indonesia and Betawi people in Jakarta. Nasi kebuli was influenced by Arab culture and its origin can be traced to Middle eastern cuisine, especially Yemeni Arabian influence (Mandi rice) or Kabsa, and also Indian cuisine influence (Biryani rice).\n\nIn Betawi culture, Nasi kebuli usually served during Islamic religious festivities, such as hari raya lebaran, kurban or maulid nabi (birthday of Muhammad). Nasi kebuli also popular in cities with significant Arab descendants, such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Surakarta and Gresik.\n\nAccording to etymology study, nasi kebuli can trace its origin from Kabuli Palaw which is an Afghani rice dish from Kabul, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent, but with heavy influence of Hadhrami and Indian cuisine such as Mandi and Biryani in the cooking methods and seasoning.\n\nThe Middle-Eastern version of Kabuli rice is more similar to Kabuli Palaw than Indonesian \"Nasi Kebuli\". The word \"Pilaf\" or \"Palau\" or \"Palaw\" simply means a rice dish cooked with a seasoned broth. According to history, the dish was brought to the Middle-East from the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. One distinction is the presence of shredded carrots and perhaps grapes in the Middle-east or Afghan version of Kebuli.\n\nNasi kebuli is made by cooking rice soaked in goat meat broth with milk or coconut milk instead of water. The goat meat is later cooked and mixed with sauteed spice mixture in Samin oil (ghee). The spice mixture is made from ground garlic, shallot, ginger, black pepper, clove, coriander, caraway, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and ghee. Then the goat meat, spices and sliced tomatoes are boiled together with half cooked rice in milk until completely cooked.\n\nNasi kebuli is usually served with \"asinan nanas\" (pineapple in spicy and sour sauce) or sometimes also topped with \"sambal goreng hati\" (cow liver in spicy sambal sauce) and sprinkled with raisins and sometimes nuts. In Indonesian Hadhrami community, sometimes it is served along with \"Maraq\" soup (spice lamb/goat soup).\n\n"}

{"id": "32633766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32633766", "title": "Geier (surname)", "text": "Geier (surname)\n\nGeier is a German word for a vulture. Geier is also a notable surname and less frequently is seen as a place name.\n\nThe disputed etymological origins of the word \"geier\" have confounded ornithological usage of the term in poetry, literature, biblical scholarship, and English-language dictionary and encyclopedia entries, while spawning several literary and philological misunderstandings and controversies. The surname Geier also has different and somewhat inconsistent origins, traditions and meanings, and the heraldry associated with the surname likewise is confused.\n\nThe modern German term \"geier\" is generally recognized as referring to two distinct families of carrion-eating bird whose range includes the whole of Europe and the western part of Asia. Geier refers both to birds from the subfamily Old World vulture (Aegypiinae) and the family New World vulture (Cathartidae).\n\nIn English usage, the word geier has been associated with both the gyrfalcon and the lammergeier although neither is synonymous with “geier”. For example, \"gyrfalcon\" is thought to come from French \"gerfaucon\", which is written in mediaeval Latin as \"gyrofalco\", but the first part of the word also is said to come from Old High German \"gîr\" (now \"geier\"), as in \"vulture\". The modifier, \"gyr\", “gier” or \"geier\" preceding the word \"falcon\" is now thought to be a reference to the large size of the bird rather than to its genus or family, but it has not always been so regarded.\n\nEarlier inaccurate and misleading conflations of these disparate terms resulted from reliance on imprecise biblical translations and metaphorical impressions rather than on direct anatomical or behavioral observations of the bird species themselves. In the King James Version of the Bible, in Leviticus xi, 13; Deuteronomy xiv, 17), the term \"gyrfalcon\" referred to an unclean bird, most likely an Egyptian vulture, rather than to the modern gyrfalcon, and did not refer to a falcon or an eagle. These biblical references to \"gyrfalcon\" (or sometimes \"gierfalcon\") probably were a misinterpretation of a Hebrew term more properly translated either as Egyptian vulture or lammergeier, the latter also known as the \"lamb-vulture\" or the \"bone-breaker vulture\", or historically as the \"bone crusher\" or ossifrage).\n\nThis etymological confusion has produced taxonomic confusion, as well. Some authorities actually proclaimed uncertainty whether the geier is a vulture or an eagle, and older dictionaries used the terms “geier”, “gyrfalcon” and “lammergeier”, almost interchangeably, e.g. Webster's 1913 Dictionary. \nPoets and others often assumed that the term geier refers to a form of eagle or falcon, rather than a vulture, a matter that was commented upon in the article by Harriet C. Stanton, \"Poets and Birds: a Criticism\", The Atlantic monthly. / Volume 52, Issue 311, September 1883.\nEven some encyclopedia writers adopted the view that the lammergeier \"is more closely allied with the eagles than with the vultures\", as in the 11th Edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nTaxonomic confusion may have resulted from the physical appearance of the lammergeier. Because the head of the lammergeier, unlike most other vultures, is feathered rather than naked, it bears a resemblance to the eagle or condor. “Gyrfalcon” is also sometimes rendered as \"geir eagle\", although in modern usage a gyrfalcon is a member of the falcon family and is not an eagle. The Indian vulture, another true vulture species recently recategorized as critically endangered, also was described as having a distinctly \"eagle-like bearing\" in contrast to most other vulture species.\n\nThe modern taxonomic distinction between the families of eagles or falcons and the families of vultures should eliminate any uncertainty over the respective meanings of the term \"geier\". The Egyptian vulture (\"Neophron percnopterus\") and the lammergeier (\"Gypaetus barbatus\") are true carrion-eating vultures. The term \"geier\" should not be applied to the modern gyrfalcon (\"Falco rusticolus\"); the gyrfalcon is a distinct species of falcon (the largest of the falcon family), and is not a vulture.\n\nGeier is a common surname in Germany and somewhat less common among German-American people. It is also found as a French surname, and as Russian surname. The latter probably is associated with German emigration to Russia in the 17th and 18th centuries. The surname Geier is often considered to be interchangeable with Geyer, although some sources ascribe a different origin and meaning to the two surnames. German migrants to English speaking countries often Anglicise Geier as Geyer, though this change has become less common in recent years. Similarly, Geier has often been mistakenly changed to Geyer, and vice versa in legal papers such as birth certificates and migration documents, especially in areas where the name is uncommon, or one version is vastly prevalent.\n\nMany using the surname \"Geier\" share an oral history attributing its origins to a heroic band of peasant villagers who climbed high to an aerie and clubbed to death a gigantic raptor (a \"geier\") which had been stealing and eating human babies from their village. See German family name etymology\n\nAs with the surname \"Geier\", the surname \"Geyer\" is primarily associated with the word \"vulture\". This is often used in a pejorative sense, however (as in \"nickname for a greedy or rapacious person, from Middle High and Middle Low German \"gir(e)\" as in ‘large bird of prey’, ‘vulture’\"). When affixed to a Jewish family, the surname \"Geier\" is thought by some to have a slightly different meaning. The Yiddish word \"Geyer\" means \"peddler\", and it is assumed that when last names became mandatory in Europe, the surname Geier was imposed upon Jewish peasants as a deprecatory label connoting a scheming merchant who takes advantage of the cupidity of others, i.e., a \"vulture\". The word \"geier\" more recently has evolved as a \"derogatory term for persons from the Middle East.\"\n\nA significant number of African American people with the surname Geier are found in Washington D.C. and across the Southern States, the European antecedents of which are unknown. As with the surnames of many African American families, it is likely that the names were adopted from a European American slaveowner by the name of \"Geier\", but none has been identified to date.\n\nThe etymological confusion associated with ornithological use of the term \"geier\" also has affected family coats of arms and traditions concerning family origins of those bearing the Geier surname. Some oral traditions and family histories associate the Geier surname with the eagle (as in the \"Eagle's Nest\" coat of arms) and with a peasant legend concerning a baby-stealing bird of prey in a medieval Swabian or Saxon village. Others associate the surname with the carrion-eating, bone-crushing variety of vulture. In modern times, it is not unusual for the vulture in family coats of arms or logos to be rendered as a comical caricature of a slumping and sad-sack buzzard rather than a lammergeier or gyrfalcon with \"the bearing of an eagle.\"\n\nThe ornithological and etymological confusions posed by the name or word \"geier\" have led to some interesting and sometimes comical confusions in literary uses of the term, as well.\n\nThe most notorious historical personage bearing the name Geier was Florian Geier, commonly known as Florian Geyer, a Franconian nobleman who sided with the peasants in the German Peasants' War in the early 16th century and led the ill-fated Black Company of song and fable. See Friedrich Engels, The Peasant War in Germany, passim. Several generations of the family of Florian Geyer lived in the village of Giebelstadt, where the Geyer castle is located, but the family is thought to have died off and become extinct in the early 18th century. The heraldic coat of arms of the Geyer family in Giebelstadt was not a vulture or an eagle; instead, it originally was a horse, and later became a ram in the latter part of the 17th century. See N. Shmitt, \"A Short Giebelstadt History\" (2000)\n\nOne professional baseball player bearing the Geier surname is recorded Phil Geier, aka \"Little Phil\", who played for several major league teams between 1896 and 1904 and won the American Association batting title in 1903.\n\nTwo significant cases in United States jurisprudence have involved litigants with the name \"Geier\". In one of these, \"Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.\" (98-1811) 529 U.S. 861 (2000), the United States Supreme Court held that the federal legislation requiring passive restraints in motor vehicles sold in the United States pre-empted state tort law. The plaintiff was a child named Alexis Geier who had been seriously injured in an accident while riding with her parents in a Honda passenger vehicle equipped with seat belts but not airbags. The Supreme Court held that Ms. Geier could not sue Honda for failing to install airbags in a vehicle sold in 1987 because at that time, only seatbelts were required by federal law.\n\nThe other case, commonly known as the \"\"Geier Case\"\", involved an African American teacher named Rita Sanders at what was then Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, now known as Tennessee State University. She sued on behalf of herself and others in a class action to compel the State of Tennessee to end its de facto operation of a dual post-secondary education system for white and non-white students. This litigation was initiated by Ms. Sanders in 1968. Ms. Sanders later married and became known as Rita Sanders Geier. The case had a tortuous history as the United States Government and a number of other plaintiffs joined in support of her position, and involved at least a dozen reported appellate court decisions, including \"Geier v. Sundquist,\" 94 F.3d 644 (6th Cir. 1996); \"Geier v. Richardson,\" 871 F. 2d 1310 (6th Cir. 1989); \"Geier v. Alexander,\" 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986); \"Geier v. Alexander,\" 593 F. Supp. 1263 (M.D. Tenn. 1984); \"Geier v. University of Tennessee,\" 597 F.2d 1056 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 886 (1979); Geier v. Blanton, 427 F. Supp. 644 (M.D. Tenn. 1977); \"Geier v. Dunn,\" 337 F. Supp. 573 (M.D. Tenn. 1972); and \"Sanders v. Ellington,\" 288 F. Supp. 937 (M.D. Tenn. 1968). The case was \"resolved\" 38 years later by a consent decree or settlement agreement in 2001, which imposed a 5-year period for implementation of various programmatic measures (colloquially known as Geier programs) to unwind 200 years of segregation and discrimination in the system of public higher education in Tennessee. The final confirmation of the Consent Decree was approved in September 2006. As stated in the Joint Statement in Support of the Consent Decree, \"The Geier case stands first in terms of time and precedent in a line of cases devoted to the removal of a variety of vestiges of segregation from systems of public higher education.\"\n\nWell known representatives of the Geier surname include the Geier Glove Company and the Geier Sausage Company, neither of which have any necessary connection with each other or any other American bearer of the Geier surname.\n\nAnother well-known representative of the Geier name was the founder of the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company (originally the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company), Frederick V. Geier, whose company is still controlled by the Geier family (but now known as Cincinnati Milacron, Inc.). This branch of the Geier family has been prominent in Cincinnati civic and social affairs since the early 20th century, and has endowed the Geier Collections and Research Center of the Museum of Natural History and Science in Cincinnati. Frederick V. Geier was quoted in a Time Magazine article on rearmament in 1951.\n\nTwo extended families with the surname Geier are found in Southern and Central Minnesota. The family associated with Lynn Township in McLeod County and with Boon Lake Township and other parts of Renville County is entirely descended from a single immigrant from Woldegk, Germany, by the name of Ferdinand Theodore Geier, a/k/a Ted Geier, who arrived in Minnesota in 1880 after spending 10 years as a wheelwright and truck farmer in Chicago, Illinois and nearby Cicero, Illinois. The other family, near Ortonville in Big Stone County is unrelated so far as is known. A small contingent of the Renville County Geiers settled for a brief time in Badger Township in Polk County before scattering to the winds in the latter part of the 20th century. The current president of the Minnesota Medical Association, G. Richard Geier, Jr., MD, of Rochester, Minnesota, is a native of Evansville, Indiana and not a member of either of these two Minnesota Geier families.\n\n\nA number of academics, scholars, musicians and musical groups, businesses and professionals in the United States also bear the name \"Geier\".\n\n"}

{"id": "32652613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32652613", "title": "Candy bar", "text": "Candy bar\n\nA candy bar is a type of sugar confectionery that is in the shape of a bar. Many varieties of candy bars exist, and many are mass-produced.\n\nA candy bar frequently, though not necessarily, includes chocolate. A \"combination candy bar\" is one that contains chocolate plus other ingredients, such as nuts or nougat. The Goo Goo Cluster was the first mass-produced combination bar.\n\nBetween World War I and the middle of the 20th century, approximately 40,000 brands of candy bars were introduced.\n\nThe earliest recorded candy bar was made in 1847 by Joseph Fry, a Quaker from Bristol, England. He discovered a way to mix the ingredients of cocoa powder, sugar and cocoa to manufacture a paste that could then be molded into a proper candy bar for consumption. His chocolate factory, Fry's, began mass-producing candy bars, launching the Fry's Chocolate Cream bar in 1866. Inspired by Fry, John Cadbury, founder of Cadbury, introduced his brand of the candy bar in 1849. That same year, Fry and Cadbury candy bars were displayed publicly at a trade fair in Bingley Hall, Birmingham. In addition to Cadbury and Fry, Rowntree's and Terry's were major British chocolate companies, as chocolate manufacturing expanded in England throughout the rest of the century. \n\nCandy bars were originally made from only cocoa powder and sugar. During the latter part of the nineteenth century, confectioners began to experiment with other ingredients. Swiss confectioner, Henry Nestle, added milk to his chocolate recipe to reduce the bitterness of the cocoa. Rodolphe Lindt, a Swiss confectioner and inventor, began adding cocoa butter as an ingredient in 1879. The addition of cocoa butter allowed the chocolate bar to keep its shape and melt in the mouth. In the United States, immigrants who arrived with candy-making skills drove the development of new candy bars. Milton S. Hershey, a Pennsylvania caramel maker, saw a German-manufactured chocolate-making machine at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. He immediately ordered one for his Lancaster factory and produced the first American-made milk chocolate bar. In 1897, following the lead of Swiss companies, Cadbury introduced its own line of milk chocolate bars, with Cadbury Dairy Milk, produced in 1905, becoming the company's best selling bar in the UK.\n\nThe chocolate bar became popular in the U.S. during World War I, when the U.S. Army commissioned a number of American chocolate makers to produce 40 pound blocks of chocolate. These were shipped to Army quartermaster bases and distributed to the troops stationed throughout Europe. When the soldiers returned home, they demanded chocolate, and the future of the candy bar in the U.S. was assured. The first combination bar, marketed primarily in the South, was the Goo Goo Cluster, produced by the Standard Candy Company of Nashville, Tennessee in 1912. It was made of caramel, marshmallow, and peanuts, covered with milk chocolate. The Clark Bar, a crispy core with caramel and peanut butter covered with milk chocolate, became the first nationally-marketed combination bar in the U.S.\n\nIt has been estimated that around 30,000 varieties of candy bars existed in the United States during the 1920s, most of which were produced locally. George Williamson of Williamson Candy Co. named the Oh Henry! after an electrician who visited his store and flirted with the female candy makers. Williamson launched an advertising campaign that included newspaper ads, streetcar signs, and billboards, and the Oh Henry! bar became one of the top-selling brands in the U.S. in the 1920s. In 1926, the company published a book, \"60 New Ways to Serve a Famous Candy\", that included recipes for salads, side dishes, and sweet breads, in addition to desserts.\n\nOtto Schnering, owner of the Curtiss Candy Co., developed the Baby Ruth by modifying their original candy bar, Kandy Kake, to compete with the Oh Henry! bar. Schnering claimed that the Baby Ruth was named in honor of President Grover Cleveland's daughter, who died at age 12, but some historians suggest that Schnering chose the name to take advantage of the popularity of Babe Ruth without having to pay royalties. Schnering decided to sell his bar for half the price of its competitor, hiring legendary Chicago ad man, Eddy S. Brandt, to market the Baby Ruth under the slogan \"Everything you want for a nickel.\" The catchy slogan, along with other innovative marketing tactics, like sponsoring circuses and dropping Baby Ruth bars over cities from airplanes, made Baby Ruth the most popular candy bar in the U.S by 1925.\n\nCurtiss Candy became a major player in the emerging national candy brand business, launching other bars like the peanut butter crunch, Butterfinger. Other candy bars sold by Curtiss Candy are no longer produced: the Dip had a soft nougat center, similar to the Three Musketeers and the Buy Jiminy was a peanut candy bar, similar to the PayDay.\n\nA chocolate bar is a candy bar that has chocolate liquor and cocoa butter as the main ingredients. Milk chocolate is made by adding milk in the form of milk powder, milk solids or condensed milk and at least 10 percent concentration of chocolate liquor, while dark chocolate has minimum 35 chocolate liquor concentration and high cocoa percentages ranging from 70% to 99% with little to no milk added. Dark is synonymous with semisweet, and extra dark with bittersweet. White chocolate replaces cocoa with cocoa butter. In addition to these main ingredients, a chocolate bar may contain emulsifiers such as soy lecithin and flavors such as vanilla.\n\nAmericans generally use the expression 'candy bar' to describe what consumers in the United Kingdom call a 'chocolate bar'.\n\nCandy bars containing no chocolate include:\n\n\n"}

It consists of a hamburger, with the patty topped with chili con carne. It is often served open-faced, and sometimes the chili is served alongside the burger rather than on top. The chili may be served alone, or with cheese, onions, or occasionally tomatoes as garnishes.\n\nChili burgers appear to have been invented in the 1920s by Thomas M. \"Ptomaine Tommy\" DeForest, who founded a sawdust-floored all-night restaurant, \"Ptomaine Tommy's\", located in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. Ptomaine Tommy's was open from around 1919 to 1958, where his chili burger was referred to as \"size\", and chopped onions as \"flowers\" or \"violets\".\n\nThe term \"size\" for a chili burger arguably derives from the portion size of the chili used at Ptomaine Tommy's. Ptomaine Tommy \"had two ladles, a large and a small\" with which to serve his chili, whether smothered on top of the burger or in a bowl; originally the ordering lingo used by his patrons was \"hamburger size\" vs. \"steak size\", but later simplified to \"size\" and \"oversize\". The use of the shorthand term \"size\" for burger-size portion of chili (in a bowl or on a burger) then gained currency throughout Los Angeles. Ptomaine Tommy was forced to close his restaurant August 10, 1958 and sell his property to satisfy creditors, and he died just a week later. His service to the community and his invention was noted by resolution of the California State Senate that same year.\n\nFood author John T. Edge considers the invention the milestone that marks the start of \"traceable history of burgers in LA\", a first step to what he considers the \"baroque\" character of the Los Angeles hamburger scene. By interviewing former customers and friends decades after the fact, columnist Jack Smith wrote a definitive article in 1974 about DeForest and the dish that he had invented which became a very important part of the history of Los Angeles. What helped spread the popularity of this dish was Deforest's diverse clientele which included doctors coming off the late shift at the local county hospital, fight fans on their way home after attending matches at the Olympic Auditorium, and people associated with the Hollywood film industry.\n\nSeveral US food chains specialize in chili burgers. One of these is Original Tommy's, which dates to 1946.\n\nThe Carolina Burger is a regional variant of the chili burger served with coleslaw, mustard and chopped onions. Common in local restaurants in the Carolinas, it is also periodically offered at Wendy's restaurants as the \"Carolina Classic\".\n\n"}

Usual ingredients for \"nam phrik\" type sauces are fresh or dry chilies, garlic, shallots, lime juice and often some kind of fish or shrimp paste. In the traditional way of preparing these sauces, the ingredients are pounded together using a mortar and pestle, with either salt or fish sauce added to taste.\n\n\"Nam phrik\" type sauces are normally served on small saucers placed by the main dish as a condiment or dip for bland preparations, such as raw or boiled greens, fish, poultry and meats. Depending on the type, the region and the family that prepares it, \"nam phrik\" may vary in texture from a liquid to a paste to an almost dry, granular, or powdery consistency.\n\nInstead of \"khrueang kaeng\" or \"phrik kaeng\", the words \"nam phrik\" can also be used to denote Thai curry pastes such as in \"nam phrik kaeng som\" for \"kaeng som\" or \"nam phrik kaeng phet\" for \"kaeng phet\".\n\nThe first Westerner to report of \"nam phrik\" was Simon de la Loubère, a French ambassador to the court of Ayutthaya. In 1687–88 he noted that it contains \"a mustard like sauce, which consisted of crayfish corrupted (fermented fish); which they called \"kapi\".\" King Chulalongkorn, regarded as one of the greatest kings of Thailand, repeatedly stated during his tour of Europe in 1907 that, besides \"khai chiao\" (omelette), he most missed \"nam phrik\". The chef David Thompson, an acknowledged expert on Thai cuisine, writes, \"They are at the very core of Thai cooking and have fed the Thai from their distant past to the present.\"\n\nChili peppers originated in the Americas, where they have been cultivated for over 6,000 years. They were probably introduced to Asia, and Thailand, in the 16th century by Portuguese emissaries and traders in what is known as the Columbian Exchange. Before chili peppers were known and enthusiastically embraced in Thai cuisine, other spices such as black pepper, long pepper, and Sichuan pepper were used instead to achieve the desired \"spiciness\".\n\nTypes of \"nam phrik\" vary according to the ingredients, the preparation and the region. Some may include tamarind, green mango, galangal, lemongrass, and/or mushrooms and even ingredients such as frog. If fish paste is used, it may be made in a variety of ways, by mincing dried, boiled, grilled or salted fish, or by using fish roe. In Isan, \"pla ra\", giving an intense flavor, is often used. Some types of \"nam phrik\" may be sweetened with sugar. A Thai cook book from 1974 lists over 100 different recipes. Among the most widespread varieties, the following deserve mention:\n\n\n"}

Its fame has spread across the country and they can be bought throughout Spain but typically they are a souvenir connected with the city of Ávila.\n\nThey are very popular for their distinctive look: small orange balls served in a white confectionery paper and are made to honor Teresa of Ávila.\n\nA possible derivative known as \"yema\" is also a popular delicacy in the Philippines, a former colony of Spain. However, they are commonly made as small pyramids or balls and sold as confectioneries rather than pastries.\n\nThe origin of the pastry is uncertain but there are several opinions where it comes from. One theory assumes that it was a pastry shop in the Medieval Ages in Andalusia called \"Flor de Castilla\" that first sold a pastry under the name \"Yemas de Santa Teresa\".\nDon Isabelo Sánchez, founder of the pastry shop \"La Dulce Aviles\" (nowadays known as \"Flor de Castilla\") in Ávila commercialized the pastry in 1860 under the name \"Yemas de Santa Teresa\". The success of the dish was great and other pastry chefs in Ávila soon started to sell similar pastries which they called \"Yemas de Ávila\".\nAnother theory credits the monks of the convent of Teresa of Ávila with the invention of the dish.\nWith the beginning of the 21st century the market for \"Yemas de Ávila\" expanded and they are now on demand in North America.\nTherefore, a new packaging system was developed to improve the preservation and make them survive the shipping to America.\n\nThis pastry is made exclusively with egg yolks which are stirred in copper bowls. Meanwhile, syrup is cooked with lemon juice and cinnamon to reduce it until it's a dense mixture. The consistency can be proven by dipping a spoon into the syrup and is right when the sticky liquid keeps connected with the spoon by a thin thread.\n\nAs soon as the syrup reduction is gooey enough it is mixed with the egg yolks and stirred with them at a low heat. The pastry dough is left to cool and is then moulded into the special kind of balls with a few centimetres diameter and put into the tartlet papers.\n\n"}

A French pastry shop showed Puig the preparation of cream-filled pastry and this inspired him to create the \"Xuixo\".\n\nThis pastry is very popular not only in Girona but has been also accepted in the surrounding areas and can also be found in Tarragona, Castellón de la Plana and Valencia.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century it was one of the most demanded product in the \"Xurreries\" (pastry shops, ) and nowadays it is commercialized by a candy brand that sells them not plain but with a chocolate icing.\n\nAccording to a legend in Girona the invention of the \"Xuixo\" has to be credited to \"el Tarlà\", a very sympathetic person that is very present in the legends of this area. This acrobat that entertained the citizens in a quarantine during an epidemic, fell in love with the daughter of a pastry chef. Once when he visited his beloved girl her father appeared and he hid in a bag of flour. Unfortunately he sneezed (which sounds like \"xui-xui\") and was discovered. Before the pastry chef could get angry he promised to marry his daughter and give him the recipe of a special pastry: the \"Xuixo\". He named it after the sneeze that betrayed him.\nNowadays a figure of \"el Tarlà\" can be seen every year during the spring festivities when its copy is erected at the place where he had entertained the people of Girona.\n\nThe foundation \"\"Fundació Oncolliga Girona\"\" and the government of Girona organize the popular procession \"Marxa del Xuxo\". It's a procession in which the whole family participates and strolls through the streets of Girona to discover the city's beauties. After the walk the participants are entertained with \"Xuixos\" that have been prepared by the board of pastry chefs of Girona.\n"}

As of 2018, Fireball is among the top selling whisky brands in the United States. Its foundation is Canadian whisky, and the taste otherwise resembles the candy with a similar name, Ferrara Candy Company's \"Atomic Fireball\" candy. It is bottled at 33% alcohol by volume (66 U.S. proof).\n\nAccording to the official Fireball website, the product was developed in Canada in the mid-1980s, and for a long time was little known outside of Canada. In addition to the United States and Canada, Fireball is now also available in other countries.\n\nFireball was originally part of a line of flavored schnapps developed by Seagram in the mid-1980s. The manufacturer's story line is, in part, that it was the product of a Canadian bartender's efforts to warm up from an Arctic blast. The Sazerac Company purchased the brand rights and formula from Seagram in 1989.\n\nIt was marketed as \"Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky\". Ostensibly, the named doctor was Dr. Aloysius Percival McGillicuddy, allegedly more commonly referred to as \"the shot doctor\" who was \"born\" in the year 1808. Later, in 2007, the product was rebranded as \"Fireball Cinnamon Whisky\".\n\nAn April 2014 article in \"Bloomberg Business Week\" said \"It's also one of the most successful liquor brands in decades. In 2011, Fireball accounted for a mere $1.9 million in sales in U.S. gas stations, convenience stores, and supermarkets, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. In 2013, sales leapt to $61 million, passing Jameson Irish whiskey and Patrón tequila.\" In 2012 and 2013, the product had a surge in popularity, which the company achieved by using social media, cultivating bartenders, word of mouth, and a relatively small advertising budget. It is said that the sharp increase in sales early in its resurgence(late 2011/early 2012) can be attributed to a grass roots effort by Beer Can Alley, a Des Moines, Iowa Country bar. Several national country music acts would perform at the establishment during this time and inspired multiple references in many popular songs In 2013, it became one of the top ten most popular liquors, displacing Jose Cuervo tequila. In 2016, \"Bloomberg\" reported that with estimated sales of at least $150 million in 2015, the brand had overtaken Jägermeister in popularity to become the top-selling liqueur in the United States.\n\nThe brand's label was designed by Ross Sutherland, who's also designed labels for Black Magic rum, Wheatley Vodka, and some other brands.\n\nFireball is usually consumed as a \"straight shot\" or on the rocks. The Sazerac website says \"the cinnamon flavor is often used for shooters but can add character to a mixed drink.\"\n\nThere are, however, various cocktails that use Fireball as an ingredient, and the company has encouraged a variety of such cocktails through its official website and social media channels. They include \"Cinna-Rita\", \"Fire Nut Ball\", \"Hot Cherry Fizz\", \"Red Apple Spice\", and \"Ring-of-Fire\". Another is a blend of Irish coffee called \"Fire Starter Coffee\". An \"Angry Balls\" mixer is a combination of Angry Orchard cider and Fireball.\n\nOther concoctions made with Fireball include: \n\nThe latter energy drink bomb shot may be compared to the Jägerbomb.\n\n\nIn 2014, Finland and Sweden reported that Fireball contained amounts of propylene glycol that surpassed the EU limitations of 1g/kg. \n\nAs of 2018, Fireball does not use propylene glycol in any of their products. \n\nThere is a variety of cinnamon liquor products available and are a popular form of flavored liquor. They include cinnamon vodka, tequila, and bourbon.\n\nIn early 2012, the Sazerac company sued Hood River Distillers over the allegedly confusing trade name and marketing of its product, \"SinFire Cinnamon Whisky\". The case was settled in 2013 and SinFire Cinnamon Whisky continues to exist.\n\nIn 2015, the Sazerac company filed a lawsuit complaining that the Jack Daniel's division of Brown-Forman had infringed its Fireball trademark while marketing Tennessee Fire, a cinnamon flavored Tennessee whiskey.

Then the vegetables are added, which are usually potatoes, diced carrots and parsley, cut cabbage and leek. Subsequently meat broth is poured over the mixture and everything is cooked together (some recipes also add diced onions and garlic).\n\nIn Swabia, it's common to serve the marrow of the bones with which the broth was made together with the finished stew as a garnish. As the dish is very easy to prepare, \"Pichelsteiner\" is often prepared in large-scale catering kitchens. Its consistency is normally quite thick.\n\nThe creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (née Kiesling). Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried.\nThe name is likely to have derived from the nearby Büchelstein mountain, where the annual Büchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the \"Open-air-cooking\" festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter \"ü\" is pronounced like \"i\" in the local dialect, the dish's name developed.\n\nIn Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a \"pichel\" in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer.\n\nThe dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.\n\n\n"}

Kourabiedes are sometimes made with brandy, usually Metaxa, for flavouring, though vanilla, mastika or rose water are also popular. In some regions of Greece, Christmas kourabiedes are adorned with a single whole spice clove embedded in each biscuit.

This tradition has its origin in the ancient funeral cults in which mourning was expressed by a woman's cutting off her braided hair. In the 19th century, it was common to give this rich kind of cake to the poor due to a depiction by the Austrian vernacular writer Peter Rosegger. Especially for children in rural areas, the present meant a compensation for poor food and hungry times throughout the year. Also common (especially in Linz) was the superstition that the luck of the forthcoming year depends on the success of the pastry.

It has been speculated to be one of the oldest cakes in the Taizhou region of China.\n\nShapes of the cake include round, elongated, square, oval, bevel-shaped and triangular. In shops, Huangqiao sesame cakes for sale are generally circular and oval, and sweet and salty.\nBasic ingredients include flour, salt, yeast, caramel, pork suet, onion, sesame, alkali and lard. The liberal use of sesame seeds provides crunchiness and crispness, and gives the cake a golden color. Some cakes include fillings such as leaf lard, sugar, pork flakes, longhidou, sweet osmanthus, crab spawn, jujube paste and shrimp meat, and are considered a premium product.\n\nSesame cakes have a long history. The earliest record of this kind of sesame cakes is from a book of the Northern Wei dynasty, known as \"Qi Min Yao Shu\", the first book on agriculture in Chinese history, written by the early agronomist Jia Sixie (贾思勰). The book has a chapter specifically on \"cake method\". Also, \"Travels of Lao Can\" (), written by Liu E of the Qing dynasty also has a description of it.\n\nThe origin of the Huangqiao sesame cake is unknown, but there are some stories popular in folklore. It is said that, in the Qing dynasty, a county magistrate of Rugao County passed by the county of Huangqiao and chanced upon its sesame cakes. After returning home, he could never forget the taste of it and had a strong desire for a second taste. However, these two counties were apart, and it was impractical to go to Huangqiao especially for the cakes there. He decided to send his corvee regularly to purchase a large quantity of these cakes.\n\nIn addition, many personages from the vicinity of Huangqiao had written in praise for the snack. Zhang Lihui (章力挥), the main writer of the revolutionary opera \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy\", was so taken with Huangqiao sesame cakes since childhood that he ate it in the morning, at noon, and at night. He said that it is far tastier than fish soup and any other food he had eaten.\n\nThe Huangqiao sesame cake got its major claim to fame from the Battle of Rugao–Huangqiao of 1946, from the Chinese Civil War. It was said that the communists owed its victory in that battle to the locals who provided the sesame cakes to the soldiers. This episode has been written into song as the \"Ode to Huangqiao Sesame Cake\" (黄桥烧饼歌) which was sung throughout the country.\n\nWhile initially a simple snack meant for rations, great changes had taken place to it in sixty years so that it is now considered a national snack. Originally it was made of nothing but flour with little oil and sesame that people could not enjoy except special days. In contrast, nowadays Huangqiao sesame cakes take form in new shapes like rectangles and ovals, while the fillings have been enhanced with floss, ham, shrimp, shallot, diced chicken, sausage, etc. The cakes are also smaller, reflecting its transformation from a soldier's ration to the bite-sized snack today.\n\n\n\n"}

It used to be a royal tribute during the Qing dynasty, and later was designated one of the \"Famous Chinese Snacks\" in 1997 for its peculiar flavour.\n\n\nSome ways chasan is consumed include:\n\nLong long ago, a corrupt official was sent to collect money and grain for the government. But he just made a pig of himself. When he passed Shan Yang (ancient Huai'an) county, he had a miraculous dream. In his dream, a golden phoenix landed at the top of Zhenhuai Lou with a most delicate Sanzi (predecessor of Chasan) in its mouth. Someone told him that the phoenix was an immortal phoenix and if one could get the most delicate Sanzi in its mouth, he would live forever. When he woke up, he planned to make his dream a peg to collect wealth for himself. So he ordered his subordinates to seek for the golden phoenix, or else they would be punished and fined.\n\nOf course, the subordinates could not find a golden phoenix. Finally, they seized an old man who made Sanzi for a living and told the corrupt official that the golden phoenix was hidden by the old man. The official forced the old man to hand over the phoenix and the most delicate Sanzi before dawn, otherwise, his family would all be sentenced to death. The old man could do nothing but wait for death. His grandchild called Jinfeng comforted him that she could save her family. When dawn came, Jinfeng carried a handful of Chasan and jumped into a well. Suddenly, she turned into a golden phoenix and flew to the corrupt official. The official was eating and drinking. The phoenix dived suddenly and pecked out his eyes. Then the golden phoenix turned into the most delicate Sanzi, and people called it Chasan.\n\n"}

It also refers to buildings intended for the care of ewes and goats. In Spain, there are such buildings from the 17th through 19th centuries that have been converted into houses or hotels. Other abandoned Parideras in some areas are protected by law as refuge for animals species.\n\nThe paridera is a traditional building in grazing areas of the ancient kingdom of Aragon, southern Soria and northern Guadalajara. The earliest reference dates from a deed of gift from the eleventh century. In it, the King of Castilla, Alfonso VI gives to the bishop of Siguenza and his descendants the village of Savin (now Torresaviñán), referring to a farrowing crate, which original document, written in Latin, called \"ovetarium\" and placed in the bishop's Serna.\n\nParideras were built, usually from rocks and rough-hewn logs, either in open areas or mountainous places, where protection from predators or the elements was beneficial to the sheep. The walls and foundations may be natural stony outcrops or natural caves. \n\nIts use is intended to guard the sheep, both to protect them from wild animals and to save them in those moments when not grazed. They are constructed with dry stone walls, gable roof, and roof beams in poplar, pine or any log available. They consist of a corral next to the main entrance, which has a shelter or shed and an outer closed. the corral communicates with a small opening, opening to allow passage of the Lambs, one by one. Inside there is a confined space called \"pajar\" or \"pajera\", used to store hay and grain, that preventing animals from consuming it. These facilities may be duplicated or adapted for large herds with several corrals, shelters and pajars, sometimes giving rise to its appearance resembles that of a village.\n\nThe roof is made mostly of pinewood trunks sometimes covered with fabric made from small branches of oak, pine or juniper or sometimes a fabric of woven cane plastered covers the wooden structure. It receives over an insulating bed of straw, and is intended to hold the terracotta Arab tiles.\n\nstone wall built without mortar with intermediate gravel to better hold, with variable thickness from 60 cm. to 1 meter, depending on harsh in the geographic area, are made of slate, limestone or massive sandstone depending in the most abundant material.\n\nThe wall opposite to the door, is equipped with a small window for ventilation to dry the manure accumulated in the soil by animals. Also sometimes are longitudinal slits in the walls, ever little with a width not exceeding 15 cm., for ventilation. Its design allows cover the slits with stone and rag in the cold season.\n\nFew parideras previous to the 17th century can be found as the roof of wood beams are not usually overlast more than 300 years without replacing, or manure and sheep's parasites accumulate over the years in large numbers are a problem and overgrazing depletes surrounding vegetation and is preferred by the sepherds to build another paridera to reform the old one. The new buildings could be in the same area (majada) separate from the former about 1 km or in another pasture area without depleting. They usually have nearby a well, natural source, stream, or pool that collects rain. Sometimes a pipeline or grooved terrain from the roof or the hillside collects the water rained down to a well or water tank.\n\nThe paridera accumulated, animal manure sold for farmers that used it to fertilize their fields. Manure is also an insulating material and because it is abundant sometimes is used as a winter fuel for heat.\n\nLocated in a natural environment wilder than now, the paridera allowed man to exploit the livestock in rural areas without being the prey of wild animals like bears, Wolf, vulture, eagle and fox. Also allowed to leave cattle unattended when giving birth, and because the smell of placenta attracted predators, the use of the paridera was essential. Similarly, the period between the outbreak of cereals-about-until harvest in January–July and August, forcing the animals to be controlled when they were grazing, not to devastate crops. In addition, postpartum ewes and newborn lambs weaker and smaller, evil endured the summer heat and can not follow the herd. Goats and ewes that have recently given birth or about to give birth, often leave the herd. In prevention of this behavior or other difficulties they are being stored during the day and taking them to graze at night. The Paridera name in Spanish literally means farrowing.\n\nHygienic regulations for livestock and modern prefabricated buildings have been removed to the paridera its practical usefulness. Therefore, most are disappearing because their owners do not realize the re-roof. The roof of Arab tiles, due to their craft, often cracking with frost, causing leaks, which will eventually rot the rafters of the roof to cause its collapse.

It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalist) and several other fields such as design, computer science and statistics. From the point of view of journalists, it represents \"an overlapping set of competencies drawn from disparate fields\".\n\nData journalism has been widely used to unite several concepts and link them to journalism. Some see these as levels or stages leading from the simpler to the more complex uses of new technologies in the journalistic process.\n\nDesigners are not always part of the process. According to author and data journalism trainer Henk van Ess, \"Data journalism can be based on any data that has to be processed first with tools before a relevant story is possible. It doesn't include visualization per se.\"\n\n\nOne of the earliest examples of using computers with journalism dates back to a 1952 endeavor by CBS to use a mainframe computer to predict the outcome of the presidential election, but it wasn't until 1967 that using computers for data analysis began to be more widely adopted.\n\nWorking for the \"Detroit Free Press\" at the time, Philip Meyer used a mainframe to improve reporting on the riots spreading throughout the city. With a new precedent set for data analysis in journalism, Meyer collaborated with Donald Barlett and James Steele to look at patterns with conviction sentencings in Philadelphia during the 1970s. Meyer later wrote a book titled \"Precision Journalism\" that advocated the use of these techniques for combining data analysis into journalism.\n\nToward the end of the 1980s, significant events began to occur that helped to formally organize the field of computer assisted reporting. Investigative reporter Bill Dedman of \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989 for \"The Color of Money,\" his 1988 series of stories using CAR techniques to analyze racial discrimination by banks and other mortgage lenders in middle-income black neighborhoods. The National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR) was formed at the Missouri School of Journalism in collaboration with the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). The first conference dedicated to CAR was organized by NICAR in conjunction with James Brown at Indiana University and held in 1990. The NICAR conferences have been held annually since and is now the single largest gathering of data journalists.\n\nAlthough data journalism has been used informally by practitioners of computer-assisted reporting for decades, the first recorded use by a major news organization is \"The Guardian\", which launched its Datablog in March 2009. And although the paternity of the term is disputed, it is widely used since Wikileaks' Afghan War documents leak in July, 2010.\n\n\"The Guardian\" coverage of the war logs took advantage of free data visualization tools such as Google Fusion Tables, another common aspect of data journalism. \"Facts are Sacred\" by \"The Guardian\" Datablog editor Simon Rogers describes data journalism like this:\n"}

It is believed that the concept began in the Pioneer Square neighborhood in the late 1980s or early 1990s. One possible inventor is Hadley Longe who operated a bagel cart at night. He incorporated hot dogs on bialy sticks from the Bagel Deli on Capitol Hill with cream cheese.\n\nSeattle Dogs increased in popularity at bars and music venues during the grunge movement of the 1990s. They are now often sold at bars and their surrounding street vendors at night. They are also available at and near the city's sporting venues. A vendor told \"The Seattle Weekly\" that he believed large crowds visiting stands outside of Safeco Field during the Seattle Mariners 2001 116–46 season was \"the big boom\" for the recipe.\n\nThe meat is typically grilled and the hoagie roll or bun is usually toasted. Polish sausage is common. Street vendors often cut the sausage down the middle to cook it quickly and all the way through.\n\nThe use of cream cheese defines the Seattle-style hot dog. Sellers sometimes have devices similar to caulking guns to quickly dispense the cream cheese. The owner of Dante's Inferno Dogs says that he was the first to introduce their use.\n\nGrilled onions are one of the most popular additions. Other toppings include jalapeños and other peppers, sauerkraut or grilled cabbage, and scallions. Condiments such as mustard (American yellow or spicy brown), barbecue sauce, and Sriracha sauce are favorites, while ketchup is used less often.\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "33358913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33358913", "title": "Five-planet Nice model", "text": "Five-planet Nice model\n\nThe five-planet Nice model is a recent variation of the Nice model that begins with five giant planets, the current four plus an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. After the resonance chain is broken, the five giant planets undergo a period of planetesimal-driven migration, followed by an instability with gravitational encounters between planets similar to that in the original Nice model. During the instability the additional giant planet is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is ejected from the Solar System following an encounter with Jupiter. An early Solar System with five giant planets was proposed in 2011 after numerical models indicated that this is more likely to reproduce the current Solar System.\n\nThe following is a version of the five-planet Nice model that results in an early instability and reproduces a number of aspects of the current Solar System. Although in the past the giant planet instability has been linked to the Late Heavy Bombardment, a number of recent studies indicate that the giant planet instability occurred early. The Solar System may have begun with the giant planets in another resonance chain.\n\nThe Solar System ends its nebula phase with Jupiter, Saturn, and the three ice giants in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain with semi-major axes ranging from 5.5 – 20 AU. A dense disk of planetesimals orbits beyond these planets, extending from 24 AU to 30 AU. The planetesimals in this disk are stirred due to gravitational interactions between them, increasing the eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits. The disk spreads as this occurs, pushing its inner edge toward the orbits of the giant planets. Collisions between planetesimals in the outer disk also produce debris that is ground to dust in a cascade of collisions. The dust spirals inward toward the planets due to Poynting-Robertson drag and eventually reaches Neptune's orbit. Gravitational interactions with the dust or with the inward scattered planetesimals allow the giant planets to escape from the resonance chain roughly ten million years after the dissipation of the gas disk.\n\nThe planets then undergo a planetesimal-driven migration as they encounter and exchange angular momentum with an increasing number of planetesimals. A net inward transfer of planetesimals and outward migration of Neptune occurs during these encounters as most of those scattered outward return to be encountered again while some of those scattered inward are prevented from returning after encountering Uranus. A similar process occurs for Uranus, the extra ice giant, and Saturn, resulting in their outward migration and a transfer of planetesimals inward from the outer belt to Jupiter. Jupiter, in contrast, ejects most of the planetesimals from the Solar System, and as a result migrates inward. After 10 million years the divergent migration of the planets leads to resonance crossings, exciting the eccentricities of the giant planets and destabilizing the planetary system when Neptune is near 28 AU.\n\nThe extra ice giant is ejected during this instability. The extra ice giant enters a Saturn-crossing orbit after its eccentricity increases and is scattered inward by Saturn onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit. Repeated gravitational encounters with the ice giant cause jumps in Jupiter's and Saturn's semi-major axes, driving a step-wise separation of their orbits, and leading to a rapid increase of the ratio of their periods until it is greater than 2.3. The ice giant also encounters Uranus and Neptune and crosses parts of the asteroid belt as these encounters increase the eccentricity and semi-major axis of its orbit. After 10,000–100,000 years, the ice giant is ejected from the Solar System following an encounter with Jupiter, becoming a rogue planet. The remaining planets then continue to migrate at a declining rate and slowly approach their final orbits as most of the remaining planetesimal disk is removed.\n\nThe migrations of the giant planets and encounters between them have many effects in the outer Solar System. The gravitational encounters between the giant planets excite the eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits. The planetesimals scattered inward by Neptune enter planet-crossing orbits where they may impact the planets or their satellites The impacts of these planetesimals leave craters and impact basins on the moons of the outer planets, and may result in the disruption of their inner moons. Some of the planetesimals are jump-captured as Jupiter trojans when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during encounters with the ejected ice giant. One group of Jupiter trojans can be depleted relative to the other if the ice giant passes through it following the ice giant's last encounter with Jupiter. Later, when Jupiter and Saturn are near mean-motion resonances, other Jupiter trojans can be captured via the mechanism described in the original Nice model.\nOther planetesimals are captured as irregular satellites of the giant planets via three-body interactions during encounters between the ejected ice giant and the other planets. The irregular satellites begin with wide range of inclinations including prograde, retrograde, and perpendicular orbits. The population is later reduced as those in perpendicular orbits are lost due to the Kozai mechanism, and others are broken up by collisions among them. The encounters between planets can also perturb the orbits of the regular satellites and may be responsible for the inclination of Iapetus's orbit. Saturn's rotational axis may have been tilted when it slowly crossed a spin-orbit resonance with Neptune.\n\nMany of the planetesimals are also implanted in various orbits beyond Neptune's orbit during its migration. While Neptune migrates outward several AU, the hot classical Kuiper belt and the scattered disk are formed as some planetesimals scattered outward by Neptune are captured in resonances, undergo an exchange of eccentricity vs inclination via the Kozai mechanism, and are released onto higher perihelion, stable orbits. Planetesimals captured in Neptune's sweeping 2:1 resonance during this early migration are released when an encounter with the ice giant causes its semi-major axis to jump outward, leaving behind a group of low-inclination, low-eccentricity objects in the cold classical Kuiper belt with semi-major axes near 44 AU. This process avoids close encounters with Neptune allowing loosely bound binaries, including 'blue' binaries, to survive. An excess of low-inclination plutinos is avoided due to a similar release of objects from Neptune's 3:2 resonance during this encounter. Neptune's modest eccentricity following the encounter, or the rapid precession of its orbit, allows the primordial disk of cold classical Kuiper belt objects to survive. If Neptune's migration is slow enough following this encounter the eccentricity distribution of these objects can be truncated by a sweeping mean-motion resonances, leaving it with a step near Neptune's 7:4 resonance. As Neptune slowly approaches its current orbit, objects are left in fossilized high-perihelion orbits in the scattered disk. Others with perihelia beyond Neptune's orbit but not high enough to avoid interactions with Neptune remain as a scattering objects, and those that remain in resonance at the end of Neptune's migration form the various resonant populations beyond Neptune's orbit. Objects that are scattered to very large semi-major axis orbits can have their perihelia lifted beyond the influences of the giant planets by the galactic tide or perturbations from passing stars, depositing them in the Oort cloud. If the hypothetical Planet Nine was in its proposed orbit at the time of the instability a roughly spherical cloud of objects would be captured with semi-major axes ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand AU.\n\nIn the inner Solar System the impacts of the instability vary with its timing and duration. An early instability could have been responsible for the removal of most of the mass from the Mars region, leaving Mars smaller than Earth and Venus. An early instability could also result in the depletion of the asteroid belt, and if it extended for a few hundred thousand years, the excitement of its eccentricities and inclinations. Asteroid collisional families can be dispersed due to interactions with various resonances and by encounters with the ice giant as it crosses the asteroid belt. Planetesimals from the outer belt are embedded in the asteroid belt as P- and D-type asteroids when their aphelion are lowered below Jupiter's orbit while they are in a resonance or during encounters with the ice giant, with some reaching the inner asteroid belt due to encounters with the ice giant. A late instability would have to be brief, driving a rapid separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, to avoid the excitation of the eccentricities of the inner planets due to secular resonance sweeping. This would also lead to more modest changes in the asteroid's orbits if the asteroid belt had an initial low mass, or if it had been depleted and excited by the Grand Tack, possibly shifting the distribution of their eccentricities toward the current distribution. A late instability could also result in roughly half of the asteroids escaping from the core of a previously depleted asteroid belt (less than in the original Nice model) leading to a smaller, but extended bombardment of the inner planets by rocky objects when an inner extension of the asteroid belt is disrupted when the planets reach their present positions.\n\nCurrent theories of planetary formation do not allow for the accretion of Uranus and Neptune in their present positions. The protoplanetary disk was too diffuse and the time scales too long for them to form via planetesimal accretion before the gas disk dissipated, and numerical models indicate that later accretion would be halted once Pluto-sized planetesimals formed. Although more recent models including pebble accretion allow for faster growth the inward migration of the planets due to interactions with the gas disk leave them in closer orbits.\n\nIt is now widely accepted that the Solar System was initially more compact and that the outer planets migrated outward to their current positions. The planetesimal-driven migration of the outer planets was first described in 1984 by Fernandez and Ip. This process is driven by the exchange of angular momentum between the planets and planetesimals originating from an outer disk. Early dynamical models assumed that this migration was smooth. In addition to reproducing the current positions of the outer planets, these models offered explanations for: the populations of resonant objects in the Kuiper belt, the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit, the inclinations of the hot classical Kuiper belt objects and the retention of a scattered disk, and the low mass of Kuiper belt and the location of its outer edge near the 2:1 resonance with Neptune. However, these models failed to reproduce the eccentricities of the outer planets, leaving them with very small eccentricities at the end of the migration.\n\nIn the original Nice model Jupiter and Saturn's eccentricities are excited when they cross their 2:1 resonance, destabilizing the outer Solar System. A series of gravitational encounters ensues during which Uranus and Neptune are scattered outward into the planetesimal disk. There they scatter a great number of planetesimals inward, accelerating the migration of the planets. The scattering of planetesimals and the sweeping of resonances through the asteroid belt produce a bombardment of the inner planets. In addition to reproducing the positions and eccentricities of the outer planets, the original Nice model provided for the origin of: the Jupiter trojans, and the Neptune trojans; the irregular satellites of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; the various populations of trans-Neptunian objects; the magnitude of, and with the right initial conditions, the timing of the Late Heavy Bombardment.\n\nHowever, sweeping secular resonances would perturb the orbits of inner Solar System objects if Jupiter's migration was slow and smooth. The ν secular resonance crosses the orbits of the terrestrial planets exciting their eccentricities. While Jupiter and Saturn slowly approach their 2:1 resonance the eccentricity of Mars reaches values that can result in collisions between planets or in Mars being ejected from the Solar System. Revised versions of the Nice model beginning with the planets in a chain of resonances avoid this slow approach to the 2:1 resonance. However, the eccentricities of Venus and Mercury are typically excited beyond their current values when the ν secular resonance crosses their orbits. The orbits of the asteroids are also significantly altered: the ν secular resonance excites inclinations and the ν secular resonance excites eccentricities, removing low-inclination asteroids, as they sweep across the asteroid belt. As a result, the surviving asteroid belt is left with a larger fraction of high inclination objects than is currently observed.\n\nThe orbits of the inner planets and the orbital distribution of the asteroid belt can be reproduced if Jupiter encounters one of the ice giants, accelerating its migration. The slow resonance crossings that excite the eccentricities of Venus and Mercury and alter the orbital distribution of the asteroids occur when Saturn's period was between 2.1 and 2.3 times that of Jupiter's. Theorists propose that these were avoided because the divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn was dominated by planet–planet scattering at that time. Specifically, one of the ice giants was scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit by a gravitational encounter with Saturn, after which it was scattered outward by a gravitational encounter with Jupiter. As a result, Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits rapidly diverged, accelerating the sweeping of the secular resonances. This evolution of the orbits of the giant planets, similar to processes described by exoplanet researchers, is referred to as the jumping-Jupiter scenario.\n\nThe encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in the jumping-Jupiter scenario often lead to the ejection of the ice giant. For this ice giant to be retained its eccentricity must be damped by dynamical friction with the planetesimal disk, raising its perihelion beyond Saturn's orbit. The planetesimal disk masses typically used in the Nice model are often insufficient for this, leaving systems beginning with four giant planets with only three at the end of the instability. The ejection of the ice giant can be avoided if the disk mass is larger, but the separation of Jupiter and Saturn often grows too large and their eccentricities become too small as the larger disk is cleared. These problems led David Nesvorný of the Southwest Research Institute to propose that the Solar System began with five giant planets, with an additional Neptune-mass planet between Saturn and Uranus. Using thousands of simulations with a variety of initial conditions he found that the simulations beginning with five giant planets were ten times more likely to reproduce the orbits of the outer planets. A follow-up study by David Nesvorný and Alessandro Morbidelli found that the required jump in the ratio of Jupiter's and Saturn's periods occurred and the orbits of the outer planets were reproduced in 5% of simulations for one five-planet system vs less than 1% for four-planet systems. The most successful began with a significant migration of Neptune, disrupting the planetesimal disk, before planetary encounters were triggered by resonance crossing. This reduces secular friction, allowing Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved after it is excited by resonance crossings and planetary encounters.\n\nKonstantin Batygin, Michael E. Brown, and Hayden Betts, in contrast, found four- and five-planet systems had a similar likelihoods (4% vs 3%) of reproducing the orbits of the outer planets, including the oscillations of Jupiter's and Saturn's eccentricities, and the hot and cold populations of Kuiper belt. In their investigations Neptune's orbit was required to have a high eccentricity phase during which the hot population was implanted. A rapid precession of Neptune's orbit during this period due to interactions with Uranus was also necessary for the preservation a primordial belt of cold classical objects. For a five-planet system they found that the low eccentricities of the cold classical belt were best preserved if the fifth giant planet was ejected in 10,000 years. Since their study examined only the outer Solar System, it did not include a requirement that Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits diverged rapidly as would be necessary to reproduce the current inner Solar System, however.\n\nA number of previous works also modeled Solar Systems with extra giant planets. A study by Thommes, Bryden, Wu, and Rasio included simulations of four and five planets beginning in resonant chains. Loose resonant chains of four or five planets with Jupiter and Saturn beginning in a 2:1 resonance often resulted in the loss of an ice giant for small mass planetesimal disks. The loss of a planet was avoided in four planet systems with a larger planetesimal disk but no scattering of planets occurred. A more compact system with Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance sometimes resulted in encounters occurring between Jupiter and Saturn. A study by Morbidelli, Tsiganis, Crida, Levison, and Gomes was more successful in reproducing the Solar System beginning with a four planet system in a compact resonant chain. They also modeled the capture of planets in a five planet resonant chain and noted the planets had larger eccentricities and the system became unstable within 30 Myr. Ford and Chiang modeled systems of planets in a packed oligarchy, the result of their formation in a more massive dynamically cool disk. They found that the extra planets would be ejected as the density of the primordial disk declined. Simulations by Levison and Morbidelli, in contrast, showed that the planets in such systems would spread out rather than be ejected.\n\nThe giant planets begin in a chain of resonances. During their formation in the protoplanetary disk, interactions between the giant planets and the gas disk caused them to migrate inward toward the Sun. Jupiter's inward migration continued until it was halted, or reversed, as in the Grand Tack model, when it captured a faster migrating Saturn in a mean-motion resonance. The resonance chain was extended as the three ice giants also migrated inward and were captured in further resonances. A long-range migration of Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begins is most likely if the planets were captured in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain, occurring in 65% of simulations when the inner edge was within 2 AU. While this resonance chain has the highest likelihood of reproducing Neptune's migration other resonance chains are also possible if the instability occurred early.\n\nA late instability may have followed an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. The combination of a late escape from a resonance chain, as described in the Nice 2 model, and a long-range migration of Neptune is unlikely. If the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is close an early escape from resonance occurs, if it is distant an instability typically triggered before a significant migration of Neptune occurs. This gap may be bridged if an early escape from resonance is followed by an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. Resonance chains other than the 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 are unlikely in this case. Instabilities occur during the slow migration for tighter resonance chains and the distant disk is unrealistically narrow for more relaxed resonance chains. The rate of dust-driven migration slows with time as the rate of dust generation declines. As a result, the timing of the instability is sensitive to factors that determine the rate of dust generation such as the size distribution and the strength of the planetesimals.\n\nThe timing of the instability in the Nice model was initially proposed to have coincided with the Late Heavy Bombardment, a spike in the impact rate thought to have occurred several hundred million years after the formation of the Solar System. However, recently a number of issues have been raised regarding the timing of the Nice model instability, whether it was the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and if an alternative would better explain the associated craters and impact basins. Most of the effects of the Nice model instability on the orbits of the giant planets and those of the various small body populations that originated in the outer planetesimal disk are independent of its timing, however.\n\nA five-planet Nice model with a late instability has a low probability of reproducing the orbits of the terrestrial planets. Jupiter's and Saturn's period ratio makes the jump from less than 2.1 to greater than 2.3 required to avoid secular resonance crossings in a small fraction of simulations (7%–8.7%) and the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets can also be excited when Jupiter encounters the ice giant. In a study by Nathan Kaib and John Chambers this resulted in the orbits of the terrestrial planets being reproduced in a few percent of simulation with only 1% reproducing both the terrestrial and giant planets orbits. This led Kaib and Chambers to propose that the instability occurred early, before the formation of the terrestrial planets. However, a jump in the ratio of the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn is still required to reproduce the asteroid belt, reducing the advantage of an early instability. A previous study by Ramon Brasser, Kevin Walsh, and David Nesvorny found a reasonable chance (greater than 20%) of reproducing the inner Solar System using a selected five-planet model. The shapes of the impact basins on Iapetus are also consistent with a late bombardment.\n\nSufficient mass may not remain in the planetesimal disk after 400 million years of collisional grinding to fit models of the instability. If the size distribution of the planetesimal disk initially resembled its current distribution and included 1000's of Pluto mass objects significant mass loss occurs. This leaves the disk with under 10 Earth masses, while a minimum of 15 Earth masses is needed in current models of the instability. The size distribution also becomes shallower than is observed. These problems remain even if simulations begin with a more massive disk or a steeper size distribution. In contrast, a much lower mass loss and little change in the size distribution occurs during a early instability. If the planetesimal disk began without Pluto mass objects collisional grinding would begin as they formed from smaller object, with the timing depending on the initial size of the objects and mass of the planetesimal disk.\n\nBinary objects such as Patroclus-Menoetius would be separated due to the collisions if the instability was late. Patroclus and Menoetius are a pair of ~100 km objects orbiting with a separation of 680 km and relative velocities of ~11 m/s. While this binary remains in a massive planetesimal disk it is vulnerable to being separated due to collision. Roughly ~90% of similar binaries are separated per hundred million years in simulations and after 400 million years its survival probabilities falls to 7 × 10. The presence of Patroclus-Menoetius among the Jupiter Trojans requires that the giant planet instability occurred within 100 million years of the formation of the Solar System.\n\nInteractions between Pluto-massed objects in the outer planetesimal disk can result in an early instabilty. Gravitational interactions between the largest planetesimals dynamically heat the disk, increasing the eccentricities of their orbits. The increased eccentricities also lower their perihelion distances causing some of them to enter orbits that cross that of the outer giant planet. Gravitational interactions between the planetesimals and the planet allow it to escape from the resonance chain and drive its outward migration. In simulations this often leads to resonance crossings and an instability within 100 million years.\n\nThe bombardment produced by the Nice model may not match the Late Heavy Bombardment. An impactor size distribution similar to the asteroids would result in too many large impact basins relative to smaller craters. The innermost asteroid belt would need a different size distribution, perhaps due to its small asteroids being the result of collisions between a small number of large asteroids, to match this constraint. While the Nice model predicts a bombardment by both asteroids and comets, most evidence (although not all) points toward a bombardment dominated by asteroids. This may reflect the reduced cometary bombardment in the five-planet Nice model and the significant mass loss or the break-up of comets after entering the inner Solar System, potentially allowing the evidence of cometary bombardment to have been lost. However, two recent estimates of the asteroid bombardment find it is also insufficient to explain the Late Heavy Bombardment. Reproducing the lunar craters and impact basins identified with the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 1/6 of the craters larger than 150 km in diameter, and the craters on Mars may be possible if a different crater-scaling law is used. The remaining lunar craters would then be the result of another population of impactors with a different size distribution, possibly planetesimals left over from the formation of the planets. This crater-scaling law also is more successful at reproducing the more recently formed large craters.\n\nThe craters and impact basins identified with the Late Heavy Bombardment may have another cause. Some recently offered alternatives include debris from the impact that formed the Borealis Basin on Mars, and catastrophic collisions among lost planets once orbiting inside Mercury. These explanations have their own potential problems, for example, the timing of the formation of the Borealis basin, and whether objects should remain on orbits inside Mercury's. A monotonically declining bombardment by planetesimals left over from the formation of the terrestrial planets has also been proposed. This hypothesis requires the lunar mantle to have crystallized relatively late which may explain the differing concentrations of highly siderophile elements in the Earth and Moon. A previous work, however, found that the most dynamically stable part of this population would become depleted due to its collisional evolution, making the formation of several or even the last two impact basins unlikely.\n\nAccording to Nesvorný, colleagues have suggested several names for the hypothetical fifth giant planet—Hades, after the Greek god of the underworld; Liber, after the Roman god of wine and a cognate of Dionysus and Bacchus; and Mephitis, after the Roman goddess of toxic gases. Another suggestion is \"Thing 1\" from Dr. Seuss's \"Cat in the Hat\" children's book.\n\nIn January 2016, Batygin and Brown proposed that a distant massive ninth planet is responsible for the alignment of the perihelia of several trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU. Although the mechanism for the ejection of the fifth giant planet in the five-planet Nice model is reminiscent of the origin of Planet Nine, with a gravitational instability including an encounter with Jupiter, it is unlikely to be the same planet. The estimated timing of the capture of Planet Nine onto its distant orbit, three to ten million years after the formation of the Solar System, when the Sun was still in its birth cluster, is inconsistent with a giant-planet instability that was responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment. A nearby star close enough to aid in Planet Nine's capture would also result in the capture of the Oort cloud objects on orbits much closer than has been estimated from the orbits of comets. However, Batygin and Brown remarked that there is possibility of retaining the ejected giant due to interactions with the protoplanetary disk. Also, in November 2017, Brown stated in a reply to a Twitter inquiry about the correlation between the five-planet Nice model and Planet Nine \"i'd [sic] say it's a good chance that Planet Nine is Nice planet #5\"\n"}

It is known for the quality of its ingredients and the meticulous preparation involved in its production.\n\nNantong Xiting Cracker came to being during the Qing Dynasty when Guangxu Emperor was in power. By now it has about one hundred years of history. The pastry's birth is said to originate from a specific legend. Once upon a time during the aforementioned period in Xiting, a town of Nantong, a particular couple ran a pastry shop. The husband was called LengChunxi(冷纯溪). But in the town most farmers couldn't afford their products, so they made only a little money and lived on the edge of subsistence. Dissatisfied with this situation, the couple decided it was time for a change. They found most farmers liked eating crackers, so they decided crackers should become their main product. Day and night they devoted themselves to improving traditional crackers to cater to farmers. Finally they achieved success, coming up with the exceptional but still inexpensive cracker. The husband named it \"Xiting White Cracker\".\n\nXiting Cracker at first only spread around the local town. Its nationwide popularity is said to owe to the figure Zhang Jian. His ancestral residence was in Xiting and every year he went back to worship his ancestors. He was fond of the cracker, so he also presented them to far-off officials, native dealers as well as foreigner businessmen. Meanwhile, LengChunxi improved the cracker further and changed its name to \"Xiting Cracker\". Since then Xiting Cracker became popular not only among the middle class but also among the imperial family—even spreading abroad.\n\nThe preparation includes 28 steps. Fine white flour is used as the main material. The cracker is shaped by hand, then it is roasted with light fire so its surface becomes a little yellow but not burnt. It has about eighteen layers.\n\nThere are two ways of eating the cracker. One is eating it directly, and the other is dipping it into water first. In the direct manner one can taste its crispness and sweetness, but the water-dipping is better suited for the elderly to protect their stomachs.\n\n"}

The entire lemon including peel is sliced paper thin, gently mixed with sugar, and left to macerate for at least four hours and up to a full day, \"the longer the better\". During this time the mixture should be stirred every few hours, and any seeds picked out. The sugar will dissolve and the peel will soften. The beaten eggs are then mixed in, the filling added to the crust, either a lattice or full top crust added, and the pie baked. The resulting filling is a cross between marmalade and lemon curd. The pie is best served warm.\n\nModern variations may substitute Meyer lemons or brown sugar and add other flavorings such as ginger or blackberries.\n\n"}

Another early reference is in \"Renri Hishō\" () by Nijō Yoshimoto, where it is used to refer to a Japanese person who is a stranger, not a friend. The Noh play, \"\" has a scene where a servant objects to the appearance of a traveling monk:\n\nHere, \"gaijin\" also means an outsider or unfamiliar person.\n\nThe word \"gaikokújin\" () is composed of \"gaikoku\" (foreign country) and \"jin\" (person). The Meiji government (1868–1912) introduced and popularized the term, which came to replace \"ijin\", \"ikokujin\" and \"ihōjin\". As the Empire of Japan extended to Korea and to Taiwan, the term \"naikokújin\" (\"inside country people\") came to refer to nationals of other imperial territories. While other terms fell out of use after World War II, \"gaikokújin\" remained the official term for non-Japanese people. Some hold that the modern \"gaijin\" is a contraction of \"gaikokújin\".\n\nWhile all forms of the word mean \"foreigner\" or \"outsider\", in practice \"gaikokújin\" and \"gaijin\" are commonly used to refer to racially non-Japanese groups, principally Caucasians. However the term is also sometimes applied to ethnic Japanese born and raised in other countries. \"Gaijin\" is also commonly used within Japanese events such as baseball (there is a limit to non-Japanese players in NPB) and professional wrestling to collectively refer to the visiting performers from the West who will frequently tour the country.\n\nJapanese speakers commonly refer to non-Japanese people as \"gaijin\" even while they are overseas. Also, people of Japanese descent native to other countries (especially those countries with large Japanese communities) might also call non-descendants \"gaijin\", as a counterpart to \"nikkei\". Historically, some usage of the word \"gaijin\" referred respectfully to the prestige and wealth of Caucasians or the power of western businesses. This interpretation of the term as positive or neutral in tone continues for some. However, though the term may be used without negative intent by many Japanese speakers, it is seen as derogatory by some and reflective of exclusionary attitudes.\n\nIn light of these connotations, the more neutral \"gaikokújin\" is often used as an alternative term to refer to non-Japanese people. Nanette Gottlieb, Professor of Japanese Studies at the School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Queensland, suggests that the term has become controversial and is avoided now by most Japanese television broadcasters. The uncontroversial if slightly formal \"gaikokújin\" is commonly used instead.\n\n\"Gaijin\" appears frequently in Western literature and pop culture. It forms the title of such novels as Marc Olden's \"Gaijin\" (New York: Arbor House, 1986), James Melville's \"Go gently, gaijin\" (New York : St. Martin's Press, 1986), James Kirkup's \"Gaijin on the Ginza\" (London: Chester Springs, 1991) and James Clavell's \"Gai-Jin\" (New York: Delacorte Press, 1993), as well as a song by Nick Lowe. It is the title of feature films such as Tizuka Yamazaki's \"Gaijin – Os Caminhos da Liberdade\" (1980) and \"Gaijin – Ama-me Como Sou\" (2005), as well as animation shorts such as Fumi Inoue's \"Gaijin\" (2003).\n\n"}

Expletive subjects in the form of dummy pronouns are part of the grammar of many non-pro-drop languages such as English, whose clauses normally require overt provision of subject even when the subject can be pragmatically inferred. (For an alternative theory considering expletives like \"there\" as a dummy predicate rather than a dummy subject based on the analysis of the copula see Moro 1997). Consider this example:\n\nFollowing the eighteenth-century conception of pronoun, Bishop Robert Lowth objected that since \"\"it\"\" is a pronoun, it should have an antecedent. Since it cannot function without an antecedent in Latin, Lowth declared the usage to be incorrect in English. It is possible to rephrase such sentences omitting the syntactic expletive \"it,\" for example:\n\nSince subject pronouns are not used in Latin except for emphasis, neither are expletive pronouns and the problem does not arise. For example, the Latin equivalent of \"it is necessary that you ...\", , translates to 'necessitates to you'. \n\nSince English syntax and Latin syntax are not the same, the sentence was and is fully acceptable to native speakers of English and thus was and is widely considered to be proper grammar. \"It\" has no meaning here; it merely serves as a dummy subject. (It is sometimes called \"preparatory it\" or \"prep it\", or a \"dummy pronoun\".)\n\nBishop Lowth did not condemn sentences that use \"there\" as an expletive, for example:\n\nThe nomenclature used for the constituents of sentences such as this is still a matter of some dispute, but \"there\" might be the subject, \"are\" the copula, and \"ten desks\" a predicate nominal.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}

The soup has been popular ever since.\n\nDuck blood, vermicelli, dried fried tofu, dried small shrimp, duck gizzards, duck intestines, duck livers, shallots, ginger, sesame oil, caraway, (and possibly some other ingredients) are used to make the soup.\n\nAuthentic duck blood and vermicelli soup is cooked with more than twenty Chinese herbal medicines. Some of those who prepare it this way believe that these ingredients promote blood circulation, remove toxins and maintain beauty, as well as aiding digestion and warming the stomach.\n\nThe main ingredient, vermicelli, is made of sweet potato. It is smooth, soft, waxy and tasty. Other key ingredients are duck blood, dried fried tofu, dried small shrimps, duck gizzards, duck intestines, and duck livers. Furthermore, salt, shallots, gingers, sesame oil and caraway make this delicacy tastier. The soup coupled with various ingredients has visual appeal and is aromatic and flavorful.\n\n\n"}

The name \"black and tan\" had earlier been used to describe the coats of dogs, such as the black and tan coon-hound. The earliest recorded usage of the term in the drink context is from 1881, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", in the American magazine \"Puck\". The first recorded British use of the term to describe a drink is from 1889.\n\nA Black and Tan is prepared by filling a glass halfway with pale ale, then adding stout to fill the glass completely. An upside-down tablespoon may be placed over the glass to avoid splashing and mixing the layers. A specially designed black-and-tan spoon is bent in the middle so that it can balance on the edge of the pint-glass for easier pouring. Alternatively, the stout may be poured first so that the drinks are thoroughly mixed together.\n\nThe \"layering\" of Guinness on top of the pale ale or lager is possible because of the lower relative density of the Guinness. The opposite scenario (where the layer on top is heavier than bottom) would produce a buoyancy instability resulting in the two beers mixing.\n\nSeveral American breweries currently make premixed Black and Tan, for example Yuengling's Original Black and Tan.\n\nThe name \"Black and Tan\" is not used in Ireland as a term for a mixture of two beers. The drink is instead referred to as a half and half. Indeed, the drink has image problems in Ireland and elsewhere due to the association with the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, nicknamed the \"Black and Tans\", which was sent into Ireland in the early 1920s. As a result, in Ireland the name is seen as contentious and disrespectful.\n\nIn March 2006, Ben and Jerry's released an ice cream flavour in the United States for Saint Patrick's Day inspired by the drink; the name offended Irish nationalists because of the paramilitary association. Ben and Jerry's has since apologised. A spokesman told Reuters, \"Any reference on our part to the British Army unit was absolutely unintentional and no ill will was ever intended.\" In March 2012, the drink's name once more came into the news when Nike, as part of an Irish themed set of designs, released a pair of shoes advertised as the \"Black and Tan\" and generating offence similar to the earlier Ben and Jerry's ice cream.\n\n"}

It is frequently a vegetarian dish, made with whipped eggs which then are folded in with various ingredients.\n\nFor the typical \"kuku sabzi\" recipe (as pictured), the eggs and herbs are mixed and seasoned with salt, black pepper, walnuts, sometimes flour, sometime barberries, sometimes baking powder and ground turmeric or \"adviyeh\" spice mixture. The mixture is then poured into a preheated oiled pan, covered and cooked over low heat until set, sometimes flipped or finished in a hot oven. Some cooks saute the herbs briefly before adding the eggs. The amount of herb ingredient usually greatly exceeds the amount of egg, the egg merely serving to hold the kuku together, making the predominant flavor that of the herbs rather than that of a typical \"egg omelette.\" Walnuts and \"zereshk\" (barberries) are a favorite garnish for on top. It is often sliced and served hot or cold with bread or rice, yogurt, \"sabzi khordan\" (platter of fresh herbs) and\" torshi\" (pickled vegetables). Kuku can be a main dish or an appetizer.\n\nKuku is similar to the Italian dish frittata, the Arabian eggah or an open-faced omelette. Kuku typically has less egg than a frittata, and it cooks for a shorter amount of time, over a low heat, before turned over or grilled briefly to set the top layer.\n\nIranians including ethnic Persians and ethnic Azeris make many different types of kukus with a variety of flavorings. Some variations include; Kuku sabzi (herb Kuku), potato kuku (\"Kuku\" \"sib-zamini)\", lima bean and dill kuku, fava bean Kuku (\"Kuku Shevid-Baqala\"), squash Kuku, eggplant Kuku (\"kuku-ye bademjan\"), zucchini Kuku, and chicken Kuku (\"kuku-ye morgh)\".\n\nOne of the most popular variations is \"kuku sabzi\" (, 'fresh-herb kuku'), flavored with some combination of herbs and leafy vegetables (e.g. scallions, parsley, chives, coriander, dill, spinach, fenugreek leaves) and tinted a deep green. This dish is often served at Persian New Year (\"Nowruz\") and has been associated with a food one would bring to \"Sizdeh Bedar\" picnic (the 13th day of Persian New Year, marks the end of the holiday often celebrated with an outdoor picnic).\n\nAnother kuku popular in Iran is called \"kuku sib-zamini\" or \"kuku-ye sibzameezi\" (, 'potato kuku'). Potato kuku is made with shredded potatoes, onion, saffron, and sometimes garlic, chives, cinnamon, turmeric or nutmeg. Frequently, potato kuku is cooked in smaller patties, but it is also cooked as a larger pancake or baked. This dish has been compared to \"latke\", \"rösti\", and the \"tortilla española\" (Spanish omelette).\n\n\n"}

On 11 November (or later/earlier for reasons of appointment) children (usually in kindergarten and elementary school age) walk along the streets holding colourful, often self-made lanterns (\"Laternenumzug\", ‘Lantern Pageant’). Laternelaufen is slightly competing with Halloween, but they are different enough to coexist.\n\nLegend has it that St. Martin, a soldier, gave a beggar the half of his soldier's coat to protect the man from freezing to death. Afterwards St. Martin became a bishop in order to help poor people. While this story is commonly known among German children and told in connection with this tradition, it does not explain the custom of promenading along the streets with lanterns. Several reasons why it is done this way can be found (s. Origin of the Tradition).\n\nWhile Laternelaufen is a memorial to St. Martin and therefore usually takes place on 11 November, in some regions of Germany (that are rather Protestant) it may take place already on 10 November, because it is mixed up with the celebration of Martin Luther's birthday (Martinisingen). In some regions there is no fixed day. Depending on the needs of the particular organizers celebrations can often take place on different days in the same city. In Catholic regions Laternelaufen is also called \"Sankt Martinsumzug\" (‘Saint Martin's Pageant’) focusing on the aspect of sharing. In Austria, the same tradition is called Laternenfest.\n\nDuring Laternelaufen children often sing Martinslieder / Martinilieder (‘Martin songs’) that glorify St. Martin's act of sharing or songs about their lanterns.\n\nIt is not quite clear why the stories concerning St. Martin led to the custom of Laternelaufen. Maybe just like Advent wreaths Laternelaufen is a symbolic act of ‘bringing light into the world’. It is also possible that one tradition got conflated with another or that the lanterns are remains of a necessary custom due to the lack of daylight in autumn and winter. Festivals of light (a category Laternelaufen could be classified into) can be found all over the world and in many cultures / traditions (e.g. Diwali, Chanukka, Saint Lucy's Day and Loi Krathong)\n\nToday, Laternelaufen is usually organized (privately) by parents or (publicly) by kindergartens and schools, parishes or even political parties. The ways often lead through forests (if any available in the neighbourhood) since there the streets are not continuously lit so that the lanterns are the only sources of light. The procession is accompanied by parents, group leaders etc., for official pageants the organizers often also hire somebody to play St. Martin, who is displayed as a bearded man in a medieval soldier's uniform wearing a long red cape or cloak, often riding on a horse in front of the children.\n\nLaternelaufen and Halloween cannot be compared although their celebration dates are around the same days (31 October and 11 November). Their origin is different and Laternelaufen does not contain any kind of masquerades, trick-or-treating or similar aspects that are commonly associated with Halloween.\n\n\n"}

Since 1929, the indication is only allowed to be used for sausages that are in fact produced in the Frankfurt area, mainly in Neu-Isenburg and Dreieich. \n\nOriginally, Frankfurters were made without nitrite curing salt. After the special ageing and smoking methods, the sausages, now of a golden colour, are put into wooden boxes with small parchment paper between layers. Therefore, the traditional sausages have a square cross-section, but there are a few exceptions where the sausage is round.\n\nOutside Germany, \"frankfurter\" is a common designation for boiled sausages, such as North American hot dog sausages, which are called \"Wiener Würstchen\" (Vienna sausages) in Germany. In Austria, Vienna sausages are called \"Frankfurter Würstl\" as they allegedly were brought to Vienna by Johann Georg Lahner (1772–1845), a butcher trained in Frankfurt, who in 1805 began to produce sausages from a mixture of pork and beef.\n"}

Throughout the years, Croatian lace has become notable for its unique patterns and designs. In 2009 UNESCO recognised lacemaking in Croatia as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nToday in Croatia there are several centres of lacemaking tradition: the Adriatic islands of Pag and Hvar, the northern town of Lepoglava and the Sveta Marija village in the Međimurje County. \n\nPag lace is made by needle-point and consists of spider web pattern embellishments and numerous geometrical motifs. The finished product is very firm, and unlike other Croatian laces, can be washed.\n\nLace in Pag is still made today in the traditional fashion from centuries ago, and a school has opened to keep the lacemaking tradition alive.\n\nLepoglava lace is a closely worked bobbin lace, with its structure consisting of a combination of stylized geometric, floral, and animal motifs and patterns. A flax or cotton thread is used, always in the color white, and comes in various shapes and sizes.\n\nLacemaking in Lepoglava began production in the late 19th century, reaching its 'Golden Age' between the two World Wars. During this time, the lace won many competitions at international exhibitions: in Paris 1937 it won a gold medal, and two years later a bronze in Berlin. This era was one of greatest prosperity for Lepoglava lace. \n\nAn international lace festival is held in Lepoglava every year in September in honour of the town's lacemaking culture.\n\nHvar lace is unique in that the thread is collected from the aloe leaves of agave plants that grow on the island. The leaves are picked at a certain time of the year and are then specially processed to produce a thin, white thread. \n\nThe Benedictine nuns in the town of Hvar are the only ones who make the Hvar lace, which is also called \"aloe lace\".\n\n"}

Celebrity chef Julia Child personally chose this floribunda rose to bear her name.\n\nThe Julia Child cultivar features golden flowers produced in clusters that repeat all season long. Flowers are medium size, full, (26–40 petals), cup shaped, and globular. The small round bush, has foliage that is bright green, and glossy. The bush grows in height of 26\" to 31\" (65 to 80 cm), with a spread of 20\" to 26\" (50 to 65 cm). It could grow larger in warmer climates. Usually climates with warmer temperatures offer the roses a longer season, thus allowing them to get much larger than they would in a shorter season. The bright green foliage makes a nice backdrop for the buttery yellow flowers. It is used in borders, garden beds, containers, and as a cut flower. It is a popular landscaping plant, because of its bright yellow color, disease resistance, and constant bloom.\nThe Julia Child rose is heat tolerant, with excellent resistance to blackspot and mildew. It is hardy (USDA zone 4a through 10a). Free-flowering, the rose is known for its old-fashioned form and sweet licorice fragrance.\n\nRemoving faded blooms (deadheading) forces the plant to produce more flowers. Only minimal pruning is needed to maintain its shape.\n\nThe cultivar is a 2006 AARS (All American Rose Selections) winner. It was selected as \"Best of the Best\" in 2010, and won the \"Gold Star of the South Pacific\" in the 2011 New Zealand Rose Trials.\n\nIn Australia, the Julia Child rose is patented under Application No: 2009/219 since 2009. In the United States, the cultivar has a patent pending, United States-Patent No: PP 18,473, submitted on Feb. 5 2008.\n"}

Thai people thought about the utility of using bamboo for cooking purposes. The ingredients of Kaolam are glutinous rice, black beans, coconut milk, sugar and salt. Moreover, taro or young coconut may be added for a more appetizing taste. To make Kaolam, the first step is to cut a piece of bamboo with one knot intact at one end and the other end exposed.

Ultimately, folklorists identify motifs in folklore to interpret where, how, and why these motifs are used, so they can understand the values, customs, and ways of life of unique cultures.\n\nIn cultural anthropology and folkloristics, the meaning of \"motif\" encompasses the meanings of \"motif\" used in the areas of music, literary criticism, visual arts, and textile arts because folklorists study motifs (i.e., recurring elements) in each of these areas, motifs that create recognizable patterns in folklore and folk-art traditions.\n\nFolklorists also use \"motif\", which Dr. Margaret Read Macdonald calls “each small part of a tale,” to refer to the recognizable and consistently repeated story elements (e.g., common characters, objects, actions, and events) that are used in the traditional plot structures.\n\nFolktale motifs were systematically indexed in 1932 by Stith Thompson and published as the \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\"; this work swiftly became one of \"the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis\".\n\nThompson built upon the research of Antti Aarne, who in 1910 had published a systematic index of European tale-types, Thompson himself had revised in 1928 to cover the region from Europe to Asia: this is known as the Aarne-Thompson tale type index. In his \"Motif-Index\", Thompson then compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in the tale-type index.\n\nThompson's \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" organizes thousands of motifs systematically. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is \"Unnatural Cruelty\"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 \"Cruel relatives-in-law\", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 \"Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law\".\n\nBelow is a sample of the index's headings.\n\nIn the book \"The Folktale\", folklorist Stith Thompson explains how motifs and tale types are interrelated as he describes the role of one type of character found in many folk narratives, the helper:\n\nThe same is true for any character or other motif. In fact, Thompson also explains that a single motif may be found in numerous folktales “from all parts of the earth” (383).\n\nThompson’s explanations show that the sequential order of motifs is also an important factor for folklorists to consider as they interpret individual motifs found in various folktale types used internationally.\n\n\n\n\nMany of the source texts in Thompson's \"Motif-Index\" are no longer currently in print. Dr. Margaret Read McDonald's \"Storytellers Sourcebook\" refers readers to stories in current books that also use motifs of folk literature. For example, Disney’s \"Cinderella\" contains many of the same traditional motifs that Read MacDonald points out in her preface to \"The Storyteller’s Sourcebook\" (e.g., Glass slipper, Cruel Stepmother, and Three-fold flight from ball) (x).\n\nMany folklorists have produced extensive motif and tale-type indices for culture areas not covered by Thompson, or covered only to a limited extent. For surveys, see\n\nThe following are some important examples:\n\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), folkloristic use of \"motif\" is not summed up in the definition for literary criticism (“Motif,” def. 3a), but deserves its own separate sense of this definition (“Motif,” def. 3b). Similarly, the compound word \"motif index\" is used in cultural anthropology to denote “an index of standard motifs, esp. those found in folk tales” (\"OED\", “Motif Index,” def. C2).\n\n"}

Always prepared with crackling, it is also a favourite for the Danish Christmas dinner served as the evening meal on 24 December or Christmas Eve.\n\nPork has been a Danish favourite for centuries but it was after the Industrial Revolution in the 1860s when wood-fired ovens were introduced for use in the home that, in addition to sausages and hams, roast pork became a popular dish. From the beginning, joints were always cooked together with the rind in order to provide crackling. Ever since, this has remained a prerequisite for the dish.\n\nThe traditional method of preparation is to roast a joint of pork from the breast or neck without removing the rind. So as to obtain crispy crackling, a sharp knife should be used to cut the skin through to the meat in narrow strips. The skin is rubbed with salt, pepper is added, while bay leaves and optionally cloves are inserted into the cuts. The joint is then roasted in a hot oven. The dish is accompanied by both boiled potatoes and caramelized potatoes (\"brunede kartofler\"). These are specially prepared by melting sugar in a frying pan over strong heat, adding a clump of butter, and allowing a portion of small round peeled potatoes (available in cans) to bathe in the mixture until they become richly browned or caramelized. Red cabbage (\"rødkål\"), which can be bought in a jar or a can, is always included too. If the cabbage is prepared from scratch, sliced apples are often added. Many Danes consider the traditional recipe to be the one described by Frk. Jensen in her 1901 cookbook.\n\n\"Flæskesteg med rødkål\" (roast pork with red cabbage) is also served cold on dark Danish rye bread as an open sandwich, known in Denmark as \"smørrebrød\".

These unique properties have made them a focus of research in many applications including solar cells, spectroscopy, signal enhancement for imaging, and cancer treatment. As well owing to their high sensitivity appear to be good candidates for designing mechano-optical instrumentation. \n\nPlasmons are the oscillations of free electrons that are the consequence of the formation of a dipole in the material due to electromagnetic waves. The electrons migrate in the material to restore its initial state; however, the light waves oscillate, leading to a constant shift in the dipole that forces the electrons to oscillate at the same frequency as the light. This coupling only occurs when the frequency of the light is equal to or less than the plasma frequency and is greatest at the plasma frequency that is therefore called the resonant frequency. The scattering and absorbance cross-sections describe the intensity of a given frequency to be scattered or absorbed. Many fabrication processes or chemical synthesis methods exist for preparation of such nanoparticles, depending on the desired size and geometry.\n\nThe nanoparticles can form clusters (the so-called \"plasmonic molecules\") and interact with each other to form cluster states. The symmetry of the nanoparticles and the distribution of the electrons within them can affect a type of bonding or antibonding character between the nanoparticles similarly to molecular orbitals. Since light couples with the electrons, polarized light can be used to control the distribution of the electrons and alter the mulliken term symbol for the irreducible representation. Changing the geometry of the nanoparticles can be used to manipulate the optical activity and properties of the system, but so can the polarized light by lowering the symmetry of the conductive electrons inside the particles and changing the dipole moment of the cluster. These clusters can be used to manipulate light on the nano scale.\n\nThe quasistatic equations that describe the scattering and absorbance cross-sections for very small spherical nanoparticles are:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3 is the wavenumber of the electric field, formula_4 is the radius of the particle, formula_5 is the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium and formula_5 is the relative permittivity of the nanoparticle defined by\n\nformula_7\n\nalso known as the Drude Model for free electrons where formula_5 is the plasma frequency, formula_9 is the relaxation frequency of the charge carries, and formula_10 is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. This equation is the result of solving the differential equation for a harmonic oscillator with a driving force proportional to the electric field that the particle is subjected to. For a more thorough derivation, see surface plasmon.\n\nIt logically follows that the resonance conditions for these equations is reached when the denominator is around zero such that\n\nformula_11\n\nWhen this condition is fulfilled the cross-sections are at their maximum.\n\nThese cross-sections are for single, spherical particles. The equations change when particles are non-spherical, or are coupled to 1 or more other nanoparticles, such as when their geometry changes. This principle is important for several applications.\n\nRigorous electrodynamic analysis of plasma oscillations in a spherical metal nanoparticle of a finite size was performed in .\n\nDue to their ability to scatter light back into the photovoltaic structure and low absorption, plasmonic nanoparticles are under investigation as a method for increasing solar cell efficiency. Forcing more light to be absorbed by the dielectric increases efficiency.\n\nPlasmons can be excited by optical radiation and induce an electric current from hot electrons in materials fabricated from gold particles and light-sensitive molecules of porphin, of precise sizes and specific patterns. The wavelength to which the plasmon responds is a function of the size and spacing of the particles. The material is fabricated using ferroelectric nanolithography. Compared to conventional photoexcitation, the material produced three to 10 times the current.\n\nIn the past 5 years plasmonic nanoparticles have been explored as a method for high resolution spectroscopy. One group utilized 40 nm gold nanoparticles that had been functionalized such that they would bind specifically to epidermal growth factor receptors to determine the density of those receptors on a cell. This technique relies on the fact that the effective geometry of the particles change when they appear within one particle diameter (40 nm) of each other. Within that range, quantitative information on the EGFR density in the cell membrane can be retrieved based on the shift in resonant frequency of the plasmonic particles.\n\nPreliminary research indicates that the absorption of gold nanorods functionalized with epidermal growth factor is enough to amplify the effects of low power laser light such that it can be used for targeted radiation treatments.\n\n"}

Connections are made on all four edges of a square package; Compared to the internal cavity for mounting the integrated circuit, the package overall size is large.\n\nChip carriers may have either J-shaped metal leads for connections by solder or by a socket, or may be lead-less with metal pads for connections. If the leads extend beyond the package, the preferred description is \"flat pack\". Chip carriers are smaller than dual in-line packages and since they use all four edges of the package it can have a larger pin count. Chip carriers may be made of ceramic or plastic. Some forms of chip carrier package are standardized in dimensions and registered with trade industry associations such as JEDEC. Other forms are proprietary to one or two manufacturers. Sometimes the term \"chip carrier\" is used to refer generically to any package for an integrated circuit.\n\nTypes of chip-carrier package are usually referred to by initialisms and include:\n\nA \"plastic-leaded chip carrier\" (\"PLCC\") has a rectangular plastic housing. It is a reduced cost evolution of the ceramic leadless chip carrier (CLCC).\n\nA premolded PLCC was originally released in 1976, but did not see much market adoption. Texas Instruments later released a postmolded variant that was soon adopted by most major semiconductor companies. The JEDEC trade group started a task force in 1981 to categorize PLCCs, with the MO-047 standard released in 1984 for square packages and the MO-052 standard released in 1985 for rectangular packages.\nThe PLCC utilizes a \"J\"-lead with pin spacings of 0.05\" (1.27 mm). The metal strip forming the lead is wrapped around and under the edge of the package, resembling the letter J in cross-section. Lead counts range from 20 to 84. PLCC packages can be square or rectangular. Body widths range from 0.35\" to 1.15\". The PLCC “J” Lead configuration requires less board space versus equivalent gull leaded components, which have flat leads that extend out perpendicularly to the narrow edge of the package. The PLCC is preferred over DIP style chip carriers when lead counts exceed 40 pins due to the PLCC's more efficient use of board surface area.\n\nThe heatspreader versions are identical in form factor to the standard non-heatspreader versions. Both versions are JEDEC compliant in all respects. The heatspreader versions give the system designer greater latitude in thermally enhanced board level and / or system design. RoHS compliant, lead-free and green material sets are now qualified standards.\n\nA PLCC circuit may either be installed in a PLCC socket or surface-mounted. PLCC sockets may in turn be surface mounted, or use through-hole technology. The motivation for a surface-mount PLCC socket would be when working with devices that cannot withstand the heat involved during the reflow process, or to allow for component replacement without reworking. Using a PLCC socket may be necessary in situations where the device requires stand-alone programming, such as some flash memory devices. Some through-hole sockets are designed for prototyping with wire wrapping.\n\nA specialized tool called a PLCC extractor facilitates the removal of a PLCC from a socket.\n\nThis package is still used for a wide variety of device types, which would include memory, processors, controllers, ASICs, DSPs, etc. It is particularly common for read-only memories as it provides an easily swappable socketed chip. Applications range from consumer products through automotive and aerospace.\n\nA leadless chip carrier (LCC) has no \"leads\", but instead has rounded pins through the edges of the ceramic or molded plastic package.\n\nPrototypes and devices intended for extended temperature environments are typically packaged in ceramic, while high-volume products for consumer and commercial markets are typically packaged in plastic.\n\n"}

It is one of two gins made on Islay, and is distinctive for its addition to the nine customary gin aromatics of a further 22 locally picked wild Islay botanicals. It is these botanicals – and the two local botanists who collect them – that give the product its name.\n\nThe gin is distilled after an overnight maceration of the nine base botanicals – the seed, berry, bark, root and peel categories – in spirit and Islay spring water. This alcohol vapour infusion from the distillation then passes through the botanical basket containing the 22 more delicate Islay aromatic leaves and petals. This double infusion gives the Botanist gin its distinctive flavour, allowing the more delicate aromatic leaves and petals to influence the gin vapour without being destroyed.\n\nThe Botanist is slow distilled in “Ugly Betty”, a Lomond Still, one of the last in existence. The distillation takes seventeen hours, four times longer than an average whisky distillation. Distilling takes place at 0.2 atmospheres of pressure.\n\nTom Morton described Ugly Betty in his book \"Spirit of Adventure\" as \"An oversized, upside-down dustbin made of copper\".\n\nDeveloped after World War II, the Lomond still was an experimental cross between a column and a pot still designed to meet the growing demand for single malt whiskies. It was designed as a \"one-stop-shop\" still by chemical engineer Alistair Cunningham and draftsman Arthur Warren in 1955 as a way to create a variety of whisky styles.\n\nTwo types of juniper are included, including prostrate juniper (\"Juniperus communis\" subspecies) that grows in the exposed sea level habitats of the Rhinns of Islay.

The use of such aromatic plants for flavouring spirit is not new. Islay’s distillers have a long tradition of using whatever was at hand to improve their rustically produced usquebaugh, distilled on small, portable stills, hidden away in remote glens.\n\n(*)= Non Islay Botanical\n\nThe Botanist has received generally positive critical acclaim for its first distillation, with features in both gin and whisky blogs and reviews.\n\nDiamond prize at the Monaco Concours of the Femmes et Spiriteux du Monde, 2011.\n\n"}

In different modern recipes, it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots, brined dill pickles, green peas, eggs, celeriac, onions, diced boiled chicken (or sometimes ham or bologna sausage), tart apples, with salt, pepper, and mustard added to enhance flavor, dressed with mayonnaise. In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as Russian salad. A variation called Stolichny salad (, \"capital city salad\") exists, and is also popular in the Russian cuisine.\n\nIn Russia and other post-Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities world-wide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on zakuski tables served during New Year's Eve (\"Novy God\") celebrations.\n\nThe original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars, and became the restaurant's signature dish.\n\nThe exact recipe — particularly that of the dressing — was a zealously guarded secret, but it is known that the salad contained grouse, veal tongue, caviar, lettuce, crayfish tails, capers, and smoked duck, although it is possible that the recipe was varied seasonally. The original Olivier dressing was a type of mayonnaise, made with French wine vinegar, mustard, and Provençal olive oil; its exact recipe, however, remains unknown.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's sous-chefs, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away on some emergency. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his \"mise en place\", which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name \"capital salad\" (). It was reported by the gourmands of the time, however, that the dressing on the \"stolichny\" salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's, meaning that it was \"missing something.\"\n\nLater, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as \"Olivier.\"\n\nOne of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a hazel grouse, two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large cornichon), 3-4 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3–5 olives, and 1 tablespoon Provençal dressing (mayonnaise).\n\nAs often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients that were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods.\n\nThe earliest published recipe known to date appeared in the Russian magazine \"Наша пища\" (\"Our Cuisine\") № 6 (31 March 1894). This magazine published from 1891 to 1896, editor M. Ignatiev, stated that the original recipe contained \"mogul sauce\" a.k.a. \"kabul sauce\" (along the lines of Worcestershire sauce), manufactured by John Burgess & Son (the brand he reputedly used) and Crosse & Blackwell. Some later recipes substituted soy sauce for the mogul sauce.\n\nThe book \"Руководство к изучению основ кулинарного искусства\" (\"Guide to the Fundamentals of Culinary Arts\") (1897) by P. Aleksandrova gave a recipe containing grouse, crayfish, potatoes, cucumber, lettuce, aspic, capers, olives and mayonnaise. The author wrote that veal, partridge or chicken could be substituted but that the authentic recipe contained grouse.\n\nIn post-revolutionary Russia, cheaper ingredients were substituted for the originals: grouse was replaced by chicken or sausage, crayfish by hard-boiled egg, cucumbers, olives and capers by pickled cucumbers and green peas.\n\nEarlier, it always included cold meat such as ham or tongue, or fish. The mid-20th century restaurant version involved not just vegetables, but also pickled tongue, sausage, lobster meat, truffles, \"etc.\" garnished with capers, anchovy fillets, \"etc.\" Some versions mold it in aspic.\n\nIn modern usage, it is usually boiled diced vegetables bound in mayonnaise, with \"Doktorskaya\"-type sausage (a genericized Soviet bologna brand). The most common alternative version, where it is replaced with boiled or smoked chicken, is called \"Stolichny salad\", after Ivanov's version.\n\nA multitude of other versions, named, unnamed, and even trademarked exist, but only Olivier and Stolichny salad have entered the common vernacular of post-Soviet states.\n\nToday's popular version of Olivier salad — containing boiled potatoes, dill pickles, peas, eggs, carrots, and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise — is a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any Soviet holiday dinner, especially of a Novy God (New Year's Eve) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with Soviet Champagne or mandarin oranges), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.\n\nFestive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally up to the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or angrily dismissed as a threat to the supposed authenticity.\n\nThe biggest Olivier salad, weighing 1841 kg, was prepared in December 2012 in Orenburg.\n\nThe salad is widely popular in the Balkans. It is known as руска салата (\"ruska salata\") in Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, and \"sallatë ruse\" in Albania, both literally meaning \"Russian salad.\" It is similarly called ρώσικη σαλάτα (\"rossiki salata\") in Greece and can be found on almost any restaurant's menu. The Bulgarian version of the salad usually consists of potatoes, carrots, peas, pickles and some sort of salami or ham. The Greek version usually contains no meat. In Croatia and Slovenia it is typically prepared without meat, and is usually called \"francuska salata\" in Croatian and \"francoska solata\" in Slovene, both meaning French salad. In Bosnia and Herzegovina both the \"ruska salata\" and \"francuska salata\" (which is essentially Russian salad prepared without meat) are very popular, especially during holidays.\n\nThe Romanian variant, called salată de boeuf (\"beef salad\"), is considered a traditional dish. It is a combination of finely chopped beef (or chicken) and root vegetables, folded in mayonnaise and finished with murături, traditional Romanian mixed pickles. It can be made vegetarian, too.\n\nIn Czech it is called simply \"bramborový salát\" (potato salad). It consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, parsley and celery root), finely chopped onions and pickles in mayo dressing, often with diced hard-boiled eggs, some kind of soft salami or canned green peas. It is the side-dish of choice to go with schnitzel or breaded carp, staple Christmas meals in the Czech Republic.\nPolish \"sałatka jarzynowa\" or \"sałatka warzywna\" (\"vegetable salad\", often simply called \"salatka\") is always vegetarian, consisting of peas, hard boiled eggs, and the mirepoix, always cut into small cubes, seasoned with mayonnaise, salt, pepper. Recipes usually vary by region (tart apples or pickles can be added) and even by household, but never to the point of meat being added. A notable exclusion is \"szałot\" (), a Silesian variety which may include not only boiled potatoes, carrots, peas and boiled eggs, but also bacon, sausages or pickled herring. Such salads are often served on family celebrations, in particular on Christmas Eve (Christmas Eve dishes are very different from the food that is served on Christmas Day).\n\"Ensaladilla rusa\" (\"Little Russian salad\") is widely consumed in Spain where it is served as a tapa in many bars. It typically consists of minced boiled potato, minced boiled carrots, canned tuna, minced boiled eggs, peas, and mayonnaise. This bears some similarity to versions of macédoine de légumes froid. In Italy, \"Insalata russa\" has same ingredients. A similar version is also popular in Portugal, where it is called \"salada russa\". It is usually served either as a standalone dish or as garnish to fish dishes, particularly fish fillets. In both Iceland and Denmark it is called Italian salad and contains carrots and green peas in mayo dressing. Often and most popular is to pair the salad with smoked meat on bread.\n\nEuropean cafes and delis often provide an entire range of Olivier-style salads, ranging from passable to gourmet. Additionally, cafeterias, convenience stores, and truck stops sell a number of sub-par factory packaged or locally made versions, mostly extremely simple, using basic ingredients flooded with an abundance of cheap mayonnaise-like dressing.\n\nIn Turkey it is known as \"Rus salatası\". The Turkish version consists of boiled and sliced carrots and potatoes, sliced cucumber pickles, boiled peas and mayonnaise and is sometimes decorated with boiled and sliced eggs, black olives and beet root pickles. It is served as meze and is used as a filling for some sandwiches and kumpir (jacket potato). Another Turkish name for Olivier salad is \"Amerikan salatası\" (\"American salad\"), a euphemistic misnomer originating from the Cold War period.\n\nOlivier salad () is popular in Iran, where it is usually made with potatoes, eggs, Persian pickled cucumbers, carrots, chicken, peas and mayonnaise, and is frequently had as a sandwich filler.\nIt is a popular salad in Pakistan and India as well, where it is usually made with potatoes, peas, apples (and/or pineapples) and mayonnaise and is frequently used as a side dish in cafes. Another version of Russian salad is also very popular in Pakistan which bears no resemblance to Olivier salad and instead is a cabbage and apple slaw.\n\nOlivier salad is believed to be introduced as a \"Capital salad\" or \"Niislel salad\" in Mongolia during the Soviet period. It usually consists of minced ham and carrots, minced boiled eggs, minced boiled carrots and potatoes dressed with mayonnaise. It is widely popular amongst Mongolians, especially during the festive seasons.\n\nBecause of immigration of Italians, Spaniards, and Eastern Europeans, the dish is also very popular in Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic where it is called \"ensalada rusa\" and has been reduced to its minimum: minced boiled potatoes and carrots, green beans and abundant mayonnaise-based dressing. In Argentina it is usually served on its own as a first course, or with a very thinly sliced beef wrapping called matambre, in a dish called \"matambre con rusa\". Argentinians of Eastern European Jewish origin may make the salad with tuna.\n\n"}

The knitted round caps were used by both soldiers and sailors, and they were widely exported.\n\nIn the early 14th century, the area immediately north of Monmouth, known as Archenfield, became known for the high quality of its wool, produced from Ryeland sheep. The wool was ideal for the production of high quality felt, and the location of Monmouth, on the River Wye some inland from the Severn estuary, allowed the produce of the area ready access to wider markets. The industry of cap manufacture by hand knitters in and around Monmouth was well established by the 15th century, when court records show Capper as a common surname in the town. The cappers or knitters, generally men, were attached to the Weaver's Guild and may have been governed by a Council of Master Craftsmen. The trade is thought to have flourished particularly in the Overmonnow area, known at one time as \"Cappers' town\". However, antiquarian sources state that much of the trade moved from Monmouth to Bewdley in Worcestershire at some point, following an outbreak of plague at Monmouth.\n\nThe headgear reached the height of its popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. Monmouth caps were essential equipment for soldiers, sailors and labourers of the period, so familiar and widely used that they were taken for granted. According to one 19th century encyclopedia, they were at one time \"worn by a large portion of the population of England and Wales.\" The Cappers Act of 1488 forbade, on penalty of a fine, the wearing of foreign-made caps in England. A further Act of Parliament in 1571, during the reign of Elizabeth I, stated that every person above the age of six years (excepting \"\"Maids, ladies, gentlewomen, noble personages, and every Lord, knight and gentleman of twenty marks land\"\") residing in any of the cities, towns, villages or hamlets of England, must wear, on Sundays and holidays (except when travelling), \"\"a cap of wool, thicked and dressed in England, made within this realm, and only dressed and finished by some of the trade of cappers, upon pain to forfeit for every day of not wearing 3s. 4d.\"\" This legislation was intended to protect domestic production, as caps were becoming unfashionable and were being challenged by new forms of imported headgear. It was repealed in 1597 as unworkable.\n\nThe earliest surviving reference to a \"Monmouth cappe\" dates from 1576, in a letter from Lord Gilbert Talbot of Goodrich Castle to his father, the Earl of Shrewsbury, accompanying a new year's gift of a cap. By that time, the caps were popular enough to have their own name, and considered to be suitable gifts between noblemen. King Henry V was born in Monmouth, and there is a reference to such a cap in Shakespeare's play, \"Henry V\", written around 1599:Fluellen: \"Your majesty says very true: if your majestie is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps; which, your majesty knows, to this hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Davy's day. \n\nIn the 1620s, the sponsors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ordered Monmouth caps - described as \"thick, warm, fulled by hand- and foot- beating and much favored by seamen\" - as part of the outfitting of the settlers. Daniel Defoe, in his 1712 \"Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain\", described Monmouth caps as being worn predominantly by Dutch seamen. Peter the Great of Russia wore one when working for the East India Company in 1697; it is preserved in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.\n\nThe caps were increasingly made outside Monmouth, and the term \"Monmouth cap\" became a generic one. Other areas, such as Coventry, produced other varieties of cap, and similar caps were known simply as knitted caps, Kilmarnock cauls, Scotch bonnets, or watch caps.\n\nThousands of Monmouth caps were created, but their relatively low cost, and the ease with which the knitting could unravel, means that few remain. The picture of the brown hat with the carrying loop is from Monmouth Museum and shows this rare example, which was knitted from coarse 2 ply wool. The cap was made by casting on at the lower edge and knitting in the round towards the top. The crown consists of a classic rounded top, with the last remaining stitches cast off. The yarn tail was wrapped around just below the cast off stitches to gather them, leaving the little lump commonly, but inexactly, referred to as a button. The doubled brim was formed by picking up stitches inside the body of the cap, and worked down to the original cast on. The cast on loops were picked up, and a 3 needle bindoff worked to finish and join the inner brim to the outer cap, ending with a little loop. Patterns that attempt a stitch for stitch reproduction sometimes result in a cap that is slightly too narrow, after felting, due to the different felting characteristics of modern knitting yarn. Each hat was made weatherproof by felting, a process which reduced its size. The distance from the centre to the hem in this example varies between 5 and .\n\nSimilar caps are now produced for historical reenactment organisations.\n\nThe Monmouth Cap Inn was a coaching inn located on the main road between Abergavenny and Hereford, at Llangua on the River Monnow. The river marked the boundary between Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. The inn was the property of the Kentchurch estate, and adjoined a ruined priory. Although the inn has closed, the name Monmouth Cap remains in use for the locality.\n\n\n"}

Festival Delle Sagre D’Asti It is one of three main September events, the others being the Douja d'Or national wine show and the Palio of Asti that runs on the third Sunday of September. By established tradition it begins on Saturday night and runs all day Sunday: however, the Saturday evening event usually attracts the higher number of visitors. Over the course of two days, the festival now attracts about two hundred thousand visitors each year.\n\nThe Sunday event starts with a colorful parade that winds through the streets of the city, depicting rural values and traditions of the province with more than three thousand characters in authentic period costumes.\n\nThe beginnings of the festival of Festivals can be traced to an idea of Giovanni Borello, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Asti, in 1974: his plan was to augment the Douja d'Or, essentially a wine competition, with a festival celebrating a bygone rural world. The organizers particularly stressed the gastronomic aspect of the event, presenting in one place the various local dishes of the area, complementing the local wines.\n\nThe \"Festival delle Sagre\" features Italy's largest open-air restaurant, offering a variety of authentic Piedmont cuisine. More than 40 Pro Loco organizations of the Province of Asti present their specialties, accompanied by Asti DOC and DOCG wines, from stalls set up in Asti's large, central 'Campo del Palio' square, arranged to re-create an old village atmosphere.\n\nBoth written and oral recipes created by generations of rural people are used each year to present a menu of over eighty different dishes, prepared using ingredients that are typical for the Asti region. Some are unusual, such as rice with Barbera d'Asti, Polenta with wild boar stew, rabbit agnolotti, fried bleak (\"alborelle\" - a type of fish), \"farinata\" (\"belecauda\" in Asti dialect) or \"bollitto\" with \"bagnetto verde\". Some dishes are prepared in almost industrial quantities - in 2004 over 4,000 kg of rabbit agnolotti were consumed - and are sold at affordable prices.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a long procession files through the Asti streets, based on the theme of country life up to the early twentieth century. The parade includes more than 3000 characters in authentic period clothing, work tools, furnishings and fixtures of all kinds, antique tractors, agricultural machines, wagons and tractors, plus a domestic zoo with various oxen, horses, mules, donkeys and other animals. The procession recreates scenes of peasant life, punctuated by the changing seasons, organized to resemble a living museum.\n\nThe procession winds through the streets of downtown for about two hours, and culminates with the food and wine fair which runs from noon until the evening.\n\n\n"}

It was devised with the aim of a simplified and more accessible version of golf.\n\nThe game is played along a distance of about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) on which the players, two per team, with as few strokes as possible, have to reach the final hole, hitting a soft polyurethane ball with a classic golf club.\n\nBeach golf was created in Pescara, Italy in 1999 by Mauro De Marco. \nIt was designed to be played on crowded beaches during the summer. Objects on the beach are incorporated into the game. Beach umbrellas, bathing people and other objects are turned into obstacles of the game. The rules allow the audience to interact with participants.\n\nThe game, developed by BGSA (Beach Golf Sport Association), has been recognized by the Centro Sportivo Educativo Nazionale (National Educational Sports Centre) and by the Italian National Olympic Committee.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, in Montesilvano, was organized the first edition of the European Beach Golf Contest, an international event which was attended by 90 athletes representing 18 European nations. The 7 days of competition have seen the triumph of the Irish Robert Cast, who took home the first continental title.\n\nNotable competitions have included the Jeckerson Cup 2005 held in the Piazza del Campo, Siena. The competition was held between 40 teams from different nations. Teams competed in the streets in a “We Golf” race (variant of Beach golf on the street) and were followed by a crowd of 80000 people.\n\nIn the following years tours were conducted during the summer on the beaches of the Italian coast.\n\n\nBeach golf has been discussed on an Italian national television network and on Radio Kiss Kiss.\nSpace was also given to Beach golf in the Rimini Wellness Fair, and Sports Day.\n\nRegulations have been created for the Beach Golf Event, aiming to anticipate various kinds of situations. The main rule states that people and things constitute natural obstacles on the path.\n\nThe game takes place along a path of 2 km of sandy coastline on the beach, where 40 teams of two players each (a pro and a beginner), challenge each other to arrive at the final hole with the fewest possible strokes. The game-track is not bounded by any type of border and is punctuated by beach umbrellas and bathers that become natural obstacles throughout the competition.\n\nBecause of the crowded place where the event takes place, the ball used is made of soft polyurethane foam to prevent injury to anyone who is accidentally hit during the game. The route is accompanied throughout its track by music and entertainment that involve, in an original way, the audience that becomes active in the field of play.\nThe range of the golfer beach is bordered by a protection zone of about 5 meters, supported by three girls on the way to accompany throughout the game.\n\nEach team is composed of two players, a low-handicap player and a high-handicap one. The sum of the two handicaps split approximately to the next lower (e.g.: mean 17.5, the team is hcp 17) and that is the team’s handicap that show how many improvements can benefit the team.\nThe game is played with only one beaten ball each turn. It is admitted that the one it replaces the other, in case you lose stroke and distance. Penalty: loss of stroke and distance.\n\nThe scorecard is a table which shows the data about the team and the history of the game. It consists of nine items:\n\nIt is a stroke-game competition held in two rounds. Two types of balls are used: a soft rubber, totally harmless ( 69 mm in diameter ) which is used along the track and a regular one on the green. There is no time limit. Players have the opportunity to stop to have a lunch break, however, teams must respect the assigned starting time.\n\nThis goes along the shore of any beach. When the Beach Golf is held in Pescara, we start from Paolucci Square and arrive at Stadium of the Sea, close to Cascella’s Ship. The track has a length of 1600 meters and a width that take the whole beach.\n\nThe starting area is located where the first ball is hit. The area consists of a synthetic rug 1.50x1.50 m2. The ball is placed on the appropriate tee and both players choose a tee shot, placing the balls in the best possible way. The honor is given (noblesse oblige) to the lower handicap player. Any missed shot or barely touched balls are considered as a shot along the path. If the ball is dropped from the tee without being touched can be repositioned to make the shot.\nEach team starts three minutes after the previous one. The delay allowed is ten minutes after the departure of the next team. The laggard team start for last with a penalty of five shots.\n\nThe equipment used consist in a classic golf club, expanded foam balls and a protection belt.\n\nPreferably sand or wedge type.\n\nThe ball is made of polyurethane foam with a diameter of 7 cm and a weigh of 35g approximately. Its composition makes them harmless, allowing to play anywhere.\n\nThis is held by the Caddy Girls and has a very important function which is to guarantee the safety of bathers, the players and anyone who is on the game-track. This is what makes the Beach Golf the only sport in the world where viewers are on the pitch and involved as active part in the game.\n\nCaddy Girls act both as game-judges and hostesses during the event. Their role is to ensure that the game takes place in a proper and safe way. The Caddy Girls support a protection belt around the area of action, aiming to allow the golfer to play in peace among the bathers, beach chairs and umbrellas.\n\nThe BGSA has planned a special calendar, featuring the Beach golf Caddy Girls.\n\n"}

A book called \"Cake Pop\" by Bakerella appeared on the New York Times bestseller list.. One of the first people to make cake pops into a successful business is Lerida Mojica owner and founder of New York Cake Pops a.k.a NY Cake Pops, LLC. Cake pops can be found in many bakeries and grocery stores.\n\nCake pops use many of the ingredients used in baking a traditional cake and can be made from cakes of any flavor. \n\nMany recipes found online use a cake mix instead of a cake batter from scratch. While more convenient, it doesn't necessarily deliver the same result. The from scratch cake recipes yield cake that tends to be denser than store-bought mixes, performing better especially after mixed with homemade frosting. The denser cake is stiffer, making it easier to shape the balls and attach the sticks. Store bought mix yields a lighter cake that doesn't harden as much, and the sticks tend to slip out after attached.\n\nOnce the cake has been baked, or when leftovers from an existing cake have been collected, it is crumbled into pieces. These crumbs are mixed into a bowl of frosting and the resulting mixture is shaped into balls, cubes or other shapes. Each ball is attached to a lollipop stick dipped in melted chocolate, and put in the fridge to chill. Once the mixture solidifies, it is dipped in melted chocolate to form a hard shell, and decorated with sprinkles or decorative sugars. The cake balls can be frozen to speed the solidification process.\n\nMost of the time making a cake pop is spent on shaping the cake into a desirable form and decorating it. Simple shapes such as spheres can be molded by hands, but complex shapes require tools. Silicone molding pan and cookie cutters are popular tools used in shaping cake pops.\n\n"}

After the separation of most of the whey, the cheese is stored for several hours in straw or plastic baskets to drain the remaining whey and to form its round shape. For the remainder of the draining time, the cheese is inverted several times to help the draining and to form the basket's pattern on all sides.\nSafed cheese is used in Sambusak, Bourekas, Salads, and as a topping for flatbread that are being baked in the oven with various spices and vegetables.\nAged Tzfat Cheese is often grated on top Of Shakshuka\n"}

It is popular in west African countries such as Nigeria and is also eaten in the Caribbean.\n\nIt is a simple dish made from dried and pounded Cassava, or manioc, root and takes upon a brown appearance once made. In Ghana the dish is locally prepared by the Akans where its local name is derived from the Kwa languages. It is also known by many as abitie, (abetee), lapiiwa, and lapelawa.\n\nThe appearance of the fully prepared Konkonte depends on the type of cassava used and to what extent it has been dried. It generally looks brownish in color but can also be chocolate-brown. Its color is similar to that of the top school uniform worn by basic students in most parts of Ghana.\n\nThe basics of cooking Konkonte begins with getting the cassava from the farm or from the nearest market. Cassava is one of the most widely eaten staples across Ghana because it is relatively cheap. One can buy relatively little of the flour and have enough for a whole family. It is this same cassava that is combined with plantain to prepare the local Ghanaian dish known as fufu (pronounced by some as \"Fufuo\").\n\nTo get edible cassava, the plant must first be peeled. The peel can be used to feed livestock or used as manure to fertilize the farm yard (if a farmer). The edible cassava is then washed. It is cut into chips. These cassava chips are usually dried in the sun, then ground at a mill into powder.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to dry cassava chips. In Ghana, some farmers have what is termed in Twi as \"Apa\", which simply refers to a kind of booth made of palm fronds on which farmers place their harvested maize. This booth is intentionally made over the locally made type of kitchen called \"Muka\". This is done so that the smoke coming out of the firewood dries the maize, in this case the cassava chips. This method of drying gives the cassava chips a blackened appearance which affects the overall appearance of the final product— the prepared and cooked Konkonte. The best method, though, is the natural way - drying the cassava chips in direct sunlight by spreading them over a drying tray usually made of a wood or aluminium big enough to spread the chips on.\n\nOne noteworthy fact is that, when the undried cassava chips are left unattended for enough time, they will start developing a form of brownish-like algae on the surfaces. After developing this fungus, the appearance of the final dish will be affected. Thus it is recommended that the chips are dried while they are fresh to retain the whitish nature of the final dish. However, many believe the browning of the chips also adds to overall taste of the Konkonte.\n\nTo convert the dried chips into powder, it is pounded in a mortar and pestle, or taken to the mill to be ground. This gives the final product that will be cooked by adding water, kneading it on the fire until cooked, then you have your Konkonte dish.\n\nKonkonte powder can be mixed with room temperature water or hot water. Some people prefer adding hot water to the powder first before cooking. It is stirred on the fire until it thickens and then it is kneaded and cooked some more. If it is too thick one adds a little more hot water to it then covered with a lid for few minutes then kneaded against the pot until the water mixes it well, (you may have to repeat the hot water addition and kneading if necessary until you get the right consistency)until it is cooked. \nServing 1: Once cooked, wet a deep bowl all around with a little water, scoop portion suitable for your meal and place in middle of bowl,draw all edges of konkonte to middle of portion, it will create a smooth base of konkonte underneath. Flip over and you should have a smooth ball to put your soup over.\nServing 2 : Some people just scoop a portion into bowl and pour their soup over it.\n\n"}

The word has thus two different, if related meanings.\n\nThe word \"borș\" is used by Ukrainian and Russian \"borshch\" or \"borscht\", but it has a different meaning: the traditional Ukrainian borshch is a beetroot soup, which Romanians generally call \"borș de sfeclă roşie\" (red beetroot borscht) or \"borș rusesc\" (Russian borscht), while in Romanian cuisine the word \"borș\" is used for an entire category of sour, hearty soups, prepared usually with the synonymous ingredient \"borș\".

For pastrami, the raw meat is brined, partly dried, seasoned with various herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed. \nAt the beginning, pastramă was a speciality from Wallachia made from young ram's meat.\n\nThe word \"pastramă\" is etymologically rooted in the Romanian \"a păstra\", which means \"to keep\" or \"to preserve\". But the word is maybe more ancient and comes from the Latin \"pastor\" who means \"shepherd\". So \"Pastramă\" is \"shepherd's meat\" so lamb or mutton.\n\nPastramă was introduced by Romans to the city of Caesarea Mazaca in Anatolia, known as \"pastron\". This recipe may be the origin of pastirma.\n\nIn 455 AD the Gepids under king Ardarich conquered Pannonia, settled for two centuries in Transylvania.

{"id": "34700457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34700457", "title": "Seven Churches Visitation", "text": "Seven Churches Visitation\n\nThe Seven Churches Visitation is a pious Roman Catholic Lenten tradition to visit seven churches on the evening of Maundy Thursday. Following the Mass of the Lord's Supper, the Blessed Sacrament is placed on the Altar of Repose in the church for Adoration. During the Seven Churches Visitation, the faithful visit several churches – sometimes seven, sometimes fourteen, sometimes no set number depending upon the particular practice – to pray before the Blessed Sacrament in each church.\n\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday probably originated in Rome, as early pilgrims visited the seven basilicas as penance.\n\nThe Via Francigena was an ancient pilgrim route between England and Rome. It was customary to end the pilgrimage with a visit to the tombs of Sts Peter and Paul. In 1300 Pope Boniface VIII declared the first Holy Year, granting a special indulgence to those, who meeting the requisite conditions, visited St. Peter's Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Over time the number of prescribed churches increased to seven.\n\nThe tradition of visiting all seven churches was started by Saint Philip Neri around 1553. He and a few friends would gather before dawn and set out on their \"Seven Churches Walk\". These pilgrimages were designed to be a counterpoint to the raucous behavior of Carnival. The Walks became very popular and began to attract others.\n\nAfter the Mass of the Lord's Supper, during which Christians remember Jesus Christ's last meal with his Apostles on the night that he was arrested, the faithful remember Jesus's Agony in the Garden. After the mass, the main and most side altars are stripped; all crosses are either removed or covered; the Blessed Sacrament is placed in a tabernacle on the Altar of Repose, and churches are open late for silent adoration. This is in response to the request Jesus made to his apostles while they were in the Garden, as recorded in Gospel of Matthew 26:40, \"Could you not, then, watch one hour with me?\"\n\nThose who practice this visitation leave the church where they attended the Mass of the Lord's Supper and travel to nearby churches to pray before the Blessed Sacrament. This occurs most frequently in urban areas where churches are in close proximity making traveling easier. There are no set of prayers given by the Catholic Church except to pray for the intentions of the Pope and recite the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and Gloria Patri. People also opt to pray the Stations of the Cross.\n\nPhilip Neri, drew up an itinerary in order to combine conviviality and the sharing of a common religious experience by discovering of the heritage of the early Saints. In modern times, pilgrimages are often arranged by parish organizations and co-ordinated with other parishes in the area.\n\nIn India, the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per Station of the Cross. This is traditionally performed on Maundy Thursday evening, but the pilgrimage is more often performed on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily fasting for the duration of the rite, but nowadays it is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn Malta, the visits may occur either after the evening Mass on Maundy Thursday, or on Good Friday until the start of the 3 PM service. While it is the tradition to visit different churches, individual churches often organise seven short processions around the church. The prayers for the visits are said inside, in front of the Altar of Repose (\"sepulkru\"), while the rosary is recited during the processions.\n\nIn the Philippines, the tradition is known as Visita Iglesia. The general practise is to visit seven churches either on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday and recite the Stations of the Cross. The pious and able would double the number of churches to fourteen, while the infirm and elderly usually visit only one or a handful. Until the 1970s, people recited all fourteen stations in every church, but the more recent form is to pray two stations per church.\n\nThe more devout would carry a cross to each church, while others consider the ritual an opportunity for sightseeing. An offering is usually made at each church and to the poor as a form of almsgiving. To accommodate the faithful, many Catholic churches during Holy Week remain open until midnight. While traditionally done on Maundy Thursday, after the Mass of the Last Supper, it is now common to perform \"Visita Iglesia\" on any day during Holy Week. \n\nSince 2010, a bicycle tour known as the \"Bisikleta Iglesia\" has also been organized, where the pilgrimage is conducted by biking on a route covering the seven churches.\n\nIn Singapore, the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria, and the \"Gloria Patri\". Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8 pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, hot cross buns and other local snacks like the traditional \"kueh ko chee\". Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\nIn the US, Holy Week observances in a particular area often reflect the traditions of the immigrant population who settled there.\n\n\n"}

It is produced in mainland China.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are currently four flavors of Jolly Shandy includes lychee, golden kiwi, lemon and ginger. Other flavors like apple, peach and pineapple have already stopped selling. Also, some special tastes of Jolly Shandy such as Mandarin orange flavor are sold in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nJolly Shandy is a brand of trendy and energetic beverage under the banner of Carlsberg . It has a tangy great taste as well as vitamin C is added for the refreshing feeling. Besides, the ingredients of Jolly Shandy includes water, sugar, beer, barley malt, carbonating agent (carbon dioxide), acidity regulator (citric acid), flavoring, Caramel color (E150c), Hops and antioxidant (E300).\n\nA typical can of Jolly Shandy (330mL with 0.6% alcohol) contains 7.5 grams per 100 mL of sugar, 0 mg of sodium, 0 grams fat, and 36 kilocalories per 100mL.\n\nJolly Shandy’s package design has been changed for several times since its establishment. On the other hand, Jolly Shandy’s outlook also alternates in different regions.\n\nIn 1990s, Jolly Shandy appeared with a two color design, separating the upper part and the bottom part. Golden “Jolly” and silvery “Shandy” labels were marked at the middle part of the can. The three tastes had their own specific colors. Before being changed to the current design, Jolly Shandy was on sale with a black coating, while there was lightning sign in respective colors of the tastes as decoration. The color of word “Jolly Shandy” has also been changed to sliver. In 2013, the design of Jolly Shandy has been reforged by a design team led by Alfonso Granati. The new two color designs with bright color are used to present the youngster-focused strategy. In the new design, the dot of letter J in the label “Jolly” is changed to yellow.\n\nThe design of Jolly Shandy in Malaysia is different from that in Hong Kong. It has the same “Jolly Shandy” label with the Hong Kong product but there are several concentric circles in the background.\n\nA new packaging design of Jolly Shandy was introduced in 2013. Carlsberg group had reportedly increased the sales of Jolly Shandy by 30% since the introduction of the Cartils’ redesign. The company slogan (Traditional Chinese：新作為 夠薑轟出嚟！) promotes ginger Jolly Shandy, the company’s latest flavor.\n\nThe brand’s localized Facebook page was launched in 2013. The Facebook page constantly releases updates and promotions of the product and is the most famous for its ‘piggyback’ marketing technique. The page usually looks at events and news stories and comes up with the ideas that allow them to ‘piggyback’ off without having the huge cost. The ironic message implied in the advertisement have successfully made the page famous and are particularly popular among Hong Kong teenagers. Aside from Facebook page, the brand also collaborates with local YouTubers and promotes the soft drink through their YouTube channels. The latest Jolly Shandy television commercial was released in 2013, featuring the Cantonese artist G.E.M., the singer collaborated with Jolly Shandy to promote her concert tickets. In addition, Jolly Shandy also advertises on public transportation within the available regions.\n\n"}

Ltd was established in 1889 in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, as a company that manufactured aerated waters, and fruit drinks. It was originally owned by the Pandole family, a well-known Parsi business name. Duke and Sons was founded by \"Dinshwaji Cooverji Pandole\". The company used to manufacture Tango, Raspberry, Ginger, Pineapple, Lemonade and Mangola drinks under the Duke's brand. The Pandole family ran the company until 1994, when it was sold to PepsiCo. When sold, Duke's had a 55% market share in the segments it operated in Mumbai and Maharashtra.\n\nPepsico manufactured the drinks until 2004, when it discontinued all the drinks apart from Lemonade and Mangola. The decision was based on the fact that the drinks were marketed only in western India, while Pepsico wanted to concentrate on its national brands. In December 2011, Pepsico announced that it was reviving the old flavours under the Duke's brand. Apart from reviving old drinks Raspberry soda, Gingerade and Ice-Cream soda, Pepsico announced the launch of a new drink, \"Mumbai Masala Soda\" under the Duke's brand. The relaunch included a bright new PET packaging as well as retro glass bottles in addition to an increased margin for small retailers, enticing them to prominently display the bottles in their shops. Pepsi relaunched Duke's Soda as well, as part of a strategy to increase market share with the help of regional brands.\n\nOriginally, Duke's manufactured lemonade from a shed in Byculla and later at \"Khetwadi\" areas of Mumbai. Its products were distributed by bullock cart and distribution was limited to Mumbai until 1940, when the company acquired Ford trucks. By 1989, the company had 90 distribution trucks. In 1970, the company established a manufacturing unit in the suburb of Chembur, with a production capacity of 19,000 crates per shift. When Coca-Cola first launched in India in the 1950s, Duke's launched Mangola, a mango flavoured juice drink to survive competition. Duke's Gingerade was popularly used when people had eaten too much or had an upset stomach, while the Raspberry drink was a favourite at Parsi weddings as well as a children's favourite. The Duke's brand is synonymous with Irani cafés in Mumbai.\n"}

{"id": "34846542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34846542", "title": "Chalandamarz", "text": "Chalandamarz\n\nChalandamarz is an ancient tradition and festival that is celebrated by the Romansh speaking part of the Swiss Canton Graubünden. It is celebrated on the first of March and marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring. \n\nThe name of the festival refers to the first day of March, on which it is celebrated, the Romansh term \"chalanda, \"stemming from the Latin word \"calandae\", meaning \"\"first day of the month\". \"\n\nChalandamarz dates as far back as the time when southeastern Switzerland, or Raetia, was part of the Roman Empire, and therefore the tradition is probably older than Christianity, and some records say it is even older than the Roman empire.\nChalandamarz is still celebrated in the Engadin valley, the Val Müstair, Oberhalbstein valley and Albula valley, but not it Sutselva and Surselva. \nIt is a pagan festival, and the object is to mark the beginning of a new year in spring, to scare away the evil spirits of winter and wake up the good spirits of spring.\nThe means the spirits are supposedly roused is through noise, which comes from large old cowbells, whips and singing.\nOn the first of March, and often at least one day before, the boys of each village go around and ring bells and sing. Girls traditionally don’t take part in this, but in some villages girls carry baskets around to gather money, and in some villages they carry bells too. Often the boys march around the village fountains, and go into the old houses and sing.\nAfter this, there is often whipping. In the evening on the first of March, there is often a party with dancing. The procession of boys at Chalandamarz is often led by the oldest boys who are due to leave school the following year. These are known as Patruns (meaning „masters“ in Romansh).\n\nBells and whips are commonly used at Chalandamarz. There are many different types, and they are organized into families.\n\nTalacs.\nTalacs are small bells and the only ones which are still worn by cows in the Engadin (most others are much too heavy).\n\nPlumpas.\nThese are some of the largest bells, often made of bronze or brass to provide good sound. \n\nMaruns.\nThese are round bells made of steel in a thin layer, and often black in colour. The largest of these are the largest bells in Chalandamarz, up to half a metre in diameter.\n\nBrunzinas.\nThese bells are of a more widely recognized shape. They are often brass and make a unique sound. They are sometimes worn only by girls in villages where they too carry bells.\n\nZampuogns.\nZampuogns are slightly different from other bells, but not as eccentric and brunzinas. From the outside they are very smooth, made of bronze and brass and can easily crack. Their ringer is very thick and it often produces a low but clear sound. They are heavier than regular plumpas.\n\nRolls.\nRolls are large belts with roll-bells attached. They are often worn by the oldest boys, the youngest or the oldest Patruns. Some villages still retain the tradition of using horses to pull the boys to smaller villages on the outskirts of the main village, and in this case the horses wear them.\n\nWhips.\nWhips produce deafening cracks to scare the spirits of winter away. Many are fooled by the illusion that the sound is caused by the whip striking the ground, but it is actually caused by air rushing around a small piece of string at the end of the whip. Whips are often carried by Patruns during the Chalandamarz procession and these often pretend to hit the younger boys as a joke.\n\nAlthough Chalandamarz follows the basic principles throughout the area where it is practised, the detailes greatly vary from village to village.\nThe following varieties exist:\n\nChalandamarz in Pontresina-Punt Muragl\n\nChalandamarz in St. Moritz\n\nChalandamarz in Celerina\n\nChalandamarz in Samedan\n\nChalandamarz in Bever\n\nChalandamarz in La Punt\n\nChalandamarz in Zuoz-Madulain\n\nChalandamarz in S-chanf-Chapella\n\nChalandamarz in Zernez\n\nChalandamarz in Susch\n\nChalandamarz in Lavin\n\nChalandamarz in Guarda\n\nChalandamarz in Ardez\n\nChalandamarz in Ftan\n\nChalandamarz in Scuol-Tarasp\n\nChalandamarz in Val Müstair\n\nChalandamarz in Oberhalbstein Valley\n\nChalandamarz in Albula Valley\n"}

Some variations of the drink exist, such as blueberry and raspberry lemon drops. It is served at some bars and restaurants in the United States, and in such establishments in other areas of the world.\n\nA lemon drop is a cocktail with a lemony, sweet and sour flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared with the addition of lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.\n\nCointreau-brand triple sec is used in some versions, and it may be prepared using a simple syrup that has been infused with lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using sour mix, a cocktail mixer. A garnish of a sliced lemon wheel, wedge, zest, rind or a lemon twist is sometimes used. Additional ingredients may also be used in the drink's preparation, such as ginger syrup and lavender extract.\n\nA lemon drop is typically prepared straight up, meaning that it is shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as a martini glass. The glass may be prepared with a sugared rim, performed by dipping the rim of the glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into a rimmer (a shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called \"bar sugar\", \"caster sugar\", \"castor sugar\" and \"ultrafine sugar\"), which is more finely ground compared to standard granulated sugar, is sometimes used for this purpose.\n\nThe lemon drop was invented sometime in the 1970s by Norman Jay Hobday, the founder and proprietor of Henry Africa's, a fern bar in the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California that opened in 1969. It was originally served in a cocktail glass. The Lemon Drop was most likely named after lemon drop candy. After its invention, the drink swiftly spread to many San Francisco saloons. In the early 1990s, it was often prepared as a shooter or served in a shot glass.\n\nVariations of the drink include lemon drops prepared with blueberries and raspberries, which may use vodkas or other liquors flavored with these respective berries. These drinks may also be served or garnished with these berries, or with lemon. A blueberry lemon drop may be prepared with muddled blueberries, and a raspberry lemon drop may be prepared with puréed or crushed raspberries.\n\nThe glass may have a sugared rim, and colored sugar may be used, prepared by adding food coloring to the sugar.\n\nIn 2006, preparation of the lemon drop was presented on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", prepared by Oprah Winfrey and Rachael Ray.

{"id": "34931824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34931824", "title": "Steak", "text": "Steak\n\nA steak () is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the skirt steak cut from the plate, the flank steak cut from the abdominal muscles, and the silverfinger steak cut from the loin and includes three rib bones. In a larger sense, fish steaks, ground meat steaks, pork steak, and many more varieties of steak are known.\n\nSteak is usually grilled, but can be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.\n\nSteaks are often cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, including bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer, and zebu, as well as various types of fish, especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark, and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.\n\nGrilled portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak, and similarly for other vegetarian dishes. Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat. Grilled fruits such as watermelon have been used as vegetarian steak alternatives.\n\nThe word steak originates from the mid-15th century Scandinavian word \"steik\", or \"stickna\"' in the Middle English dialect, along with the Old Norse word \"steikja\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary's\" first reference is to \"a thick slice of meat cut for roasting or grilling or frying, sometimes used in a pie or pudding; especially a piece cut from the hind-quarters of the animal.\" Subsequent parts of the entry, however, refer to \"steak fish\", which referred to \"cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks\", and also \"steak-raid\", which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman's land to the owner. An early written usage of the word \"stekys\" comes from a 15th-century cookbook, and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks.\n\nLivestock for meat to be used as steak cuts may be raised on a farm or ranch. The meat from various wild game may also be used for steak cuts.\n\nCountries with enough suitable land for grazing animals, in particular cattle, have a history of production and culinary use of steak. Such countries include Argentina, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, steak is traditionally sliced and stir-fried and served in smaller amounts as part of a mixed dish.\n\nIn Argentina, beef represents a large portion of the country's export market. A total of 11.8 million animals was harvested in 2010. The country has one of the largest consumptions of beef per capita worldwide, and much of it is grilled steak. Beef steak consumption is described as part of the \"Argentine national identity\". In 2010, 244,000 cattle producers were in Argentina. In Argentina, steakhouses are referred to as \"parrillas\", which are common throughout the country. Portion sizes of steak dishes in Argentine restaurants tend to be large, with steaks weighing over being commonplace. \"Asado\" is a traditional dish that often includes steak and is also the standard word for \"grilled\" in Argentina and other countries. \"Asado\" is considered a national dish of the country.\n\nDomestic and international marketing of Australian beef is undertaken by Meat & Livestock Australia, a corporation which runs programs related to quality assurance, sustainable production, and environmental considerations, through organizations such as Meat Standards Australia.\n\nThe Irish agricultural beef market is a contributor to the economy of Ireland. A significant amount of Irish beef is exported to other countries, with over 50% going to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe \"Steak of Origin\" competition has been run for a decade on behalf of the Beef+Lamb Corporation of New Zealand. It \"aims to find the most tender and tasty sirloin steak\" in the country. Criteria for judging claims to include tenderness, pH, marbling and percentage cooking loss\", but while these data are collected for each entrant steak, only the shear force (correlated to perceived tenderness) determines qualification to a tasting panel, at which objective taste from a panel determines the winner. The pH is used solely to disqualify entrants and neither the 'marbling' or the cooking loss have any effect on the outcome of the competition at any stage. Their parallel competition, which they run for lamb legs (glammies) does take into account some of these other metrics when weighting the entrants for their ranking within the competition.\n\nAccording to a survey by trade magazine \"Caterer and Hotelkeeper\", the most popular dinner menu in British restaurants in the 1980s included steak: prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest gateau.\n\nCattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus date back to the 1700s, and farmers continue to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live outdoors year-round, grow slowly as they would in their natural habitat, ultimately producing a distinctly tender meat. Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the United States, cuts of beef for retail sale include various beefsteaks, as well as stew meat and hamburger meat. In the U.S. \"circa\" 1956, about 24% of retail beef cuts were steaks.\n\nBeef production is the largest single agricultural venture in the United States, with 687,540 farms raising cattle and over a million in the production process, as of the 2007 Agriculture Census. On average, a single farm typically raises about 50 cattle at a time, with 97% of the cattle farms classified as one of these small family farms. These smaller farms average a gross cash income of $62,286 per year as of 2007.\n\nBeef steaks are commonly grilled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common characteristics of a rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well done are usually cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.\n\nFish steaks are generally cooked for a short time, as the flesh cooks quickly, especially when grilled. Fish steaks, such as tuna, can also be cooked to various temperatures, such as rare and medium rare. The different cuts of steak are - rib eye, sirloin, tenderloin, rump, porterhouse, and t-bone.\n\nCuts of steak are quite dissimilar between countries owing to different methods of cutting up the carcass. The result is that a steak found in one country is not the same as in another, although the recipes may be the same, differing \"only in their sauces, butters, or garnitures\".\n\nMost important is trying to achieve Maillard reaction on meat to ensure that restaurant-quality steak results each time.\n\nSteak has become a popular dish in many places around the world, cooked in domestic and professional kitchens, and is often a primary ingredient in a menu. It is used in small amounts in an \"hors d'oeuvre\", in an \"entrée\" dish or, more usually, in a larger amount as the main course. Steak has also been an important breakfast dish, especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work, such as farmers. Diners ordering steak at a restaurant typically advise the chef or waiter of their preferences regarding the degree of cooking, using the terms \"rare\", \"medium rare\", \"medium\", \"medium well\", or \"well done\". Print appearances of this use of \"rare\" are found as early as around 1615. A steak knife is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting the steak easier; it is sharper than other knives and may have a serrated edge. \n\nBeefsteak Clubs were once part of London's club life. They were described as \"a club of ancient institution in every theatre; when the principal performers dined one day in the week together (generally Saturday), and authors and other geniuses were admitted members.\" Dr Johnson's club in Ivy lane was originally a Beef-Steak Club and the \"Rump-Steak or Liberty Club\" was in existence from 1733–34. The present-day Beefsteak Club, established in 1876, is at 9 Irving Street, London. Among its members are many notable people.\n\nA steakhouse is a restaurant that specializes in beefsteaks and other individual portions of meat. Chophouses started in London in the 1690s, and served individual portions of meat, known as chops. The houses were normally only open for men; for example, women were only admitted to Stone's Chop House in 1921. Accounts of travellers in 19th-century London refer to their \"dining off mutton chop, rump steak and a 'weal' cutlet\", as well as hams and sirloins.\n\nDelmonico's restaurant in New York City, which opened in 1827 and stayed open for almost 100 years, has been described as \"the most famous steak restaurant in American history\". Delmonico steak refers to a method of preparation from one of several cuts of beef (typically the rib cut) prepared Delmonico style, originally from the mid-19th century.\n\nHundreds of restaurants continue to specialize in serving steak, describing themselves as \"steakhouses\", competing for culinary awards and aiming for culinary excellence.\n\nClassic sauces and seasonings to accompany steak include:\nCommercially produced bottled sauces for steak and pre-mixed spices are also popular. In 2012 in the U.S., A1 Steak Sauce had slightly over 50% of the market share for all meat sauce products, and was the category leader. Montreal steak seasoning is a spice mix used to flavor steak and grilled meats that was based on the pickling dry-rub mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat.\n\nSteak and other meat products can be frozen and exported, but before the invention of commercial refrigeration, transporting meat over long distances was impossible. Communities had to rely on what was locally available, which determined the forms and tradition of meat consumption. Hunter-gathering peoples cut steaks from local indigenous animals. For example, Sami cuisine relies partly on the meat of the reindeer; the Inuit diet uses locally caught sea-mammal meat from whales; Indigenous Australians ate kangaroo; and indigenous North American food included bison steak. In the Middle East, meat recipes from medieval times onwards simply state \"meat\" without specifying the kind or cut; \"apart from an occasional gazelle, kid or camel\", only lamb and mutton were eaten because cattle were seldom bred.\n\nIn contemporary Argentina, where steak consumption is very high, steak is a significant part of the national cuisine and the \"asado\" has the status of a national dish. In Austria, the national dish is \"Wiener Schnitzel\", which is a type of steak made from veal. Advice on butchery and recipes for American black bear steak and chops is provided by New Jersey (US) government.\n\nVegans are against the production and consumption of steak as they view the slaughter and treatment of cows as unethical. Vegan activists regularly hold protests against steakhouses. \n\nMany types of beefsteak exist. The more tender cuts of beef, from the loin and rib, are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (\"e.g.\" cube steak).\nBeef steak can be cooked to a level of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike some other meats, does not need to be cooked through. Food-borne human illnesses are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, thus very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.\n\nBeef steak is graded for quality, with higher prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef tenderloin is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, is known for its high quality and commands a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.\n\nThe quality and safety of steak as a food product is regulated by law. Australia hase National Meat Accreditation standards; Canada has the Canadian Beef Grading Agency; in the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency is responsible; in the United States, young beef is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture as Select, Choice or Prime, where \"Prime\" refers to beef of the highest quality, typically that which has significant marbling. In 1996 in the U.S., only 2.4% of cattle were graded as prime, and most Prime beef is sold in restaurants and hotels.\nThe wide range of quickly prepared and well-known beef steak dishes includes minute steak, steak sandwiches, and steak and eggs. \"Surf and turf\", which combines meat and fish, requires more time to prepare. Steak meat is also often minced, shredded, chopped finely or formed to create a range of dishes, including steak burgers, that retain the name \"steak\". Other such dishes include:\n\nFish steaks are cut perpendicular to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, salmon, and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked \"en papillote\".\n\nCommercial sashimi tuna steaks may have their coloration fixated by the use of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4°C. The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a 2-inch tuna steak takes 24 hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When used, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.\n\nLamb steaks come from a range of cuts and are a versatile ingredient that can be used in a range of dishes. It is commonly found sliced into salads.\n\nPork steaks are generally cut from the shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.\n\nCooked gammon steaks are a component of a full breakfast, whereas steaks from a rolled pork loin are more likely to be served at lunch.\n\nA Boston butt is a pork steak originating from colonial New England, where butchers would pack less valuable cuts of pork in barrels, called butts.\nThick sliced or chopped and formed chicken is used to create mainly traditional southern dishes such as chicken fried chicken. This may also refer to beef cuts such as a hip steak or a shoulder blade steak, or a small portion of chuck steak with a visible line of white connective tissue.\n\nSliced vegetables can be used as vegetarian nonmeat \"steak\" alternatives, such as cauliflower, portobello mushrooms, and eggplant. Beans and legumes (such as soybeans) have also been used to form steak-like foods. Watermelon steaks are sliced and cooked pieces of watermelon.\n\n"}

The design and construction of these figures can vary from region to region. Today, alfeñique figures, especially calaveras (known in the US as Sugar Skulls), are widely created in Mexico for the Day of the Dead celebrations in November.\n\nAlfeñique are folk art objects made from a sugar paste, originating in Italy where figurines were made from sugar for religious decorations. They became popular in Spain, wherefrom they were eventually brought to Mexico with Catholicism, where they became a part of Day of the Dead celebrations, starting around the 17th or 18th century. Alfeñique, whose name is from Arabic was used to replace the Aztec tradition of making figurines of amaranth for altars. The Spanish conquistadors brought sugar cane, which became the main ingredient in the making of these figurines which continues to this day. During the colonial period, figures of sheep made with this were popular.\n\nToday, the main production center for alfenique figures are Toluca, San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato. Today, the paste is used to form hundreds of types of shapes which include rabbits, lions, ducks, doves, cows, bulls, donkeys, pigs, frogs, horses, deer, angels, skulls and coffins. The art form has taken on more elaborate sculptures that involve more sophisticated and modern techniques that there are now encyclopedic volumes on how to create them for all different occasions, apart from Day of the Dead celebrations. There are regional fairs and events that celebrate this art form, including ones in Toluca, Mexico State and in Leon, Guanajuato.\n\nThe paste is prepared by mixing powdered sugar with chautle, a vegetable adhesive and lemon. Egg whites are beaten separately then folded into the sugar. Vegetable dyes are added for color. The unworked portion is covered with a damp cloth to keep it from hardening. Molds are prepared by carefully cleaning them, then dusting them with flour so the sugar mixture does not stick. The sugar paste is flattened into thin circles which are pressed into the molds, then left to dry for 24 hours\n\nThe two halves of the figure are then taken from the molds and joined together with more sugar paste, slightly thinned with water. This is left to dry again before decoration. Decorative elements can include cotton balls, sequins, sugar paste which is shaped and attached, plastic jewels and many other items\n\nThe different regions make their alfeñique figures according to local traditions and ingredients. Many families have been involved in making figurines for generations and some use molds that go back just as far. Apart from their popularity during Day of the Dead celebrations, many families display the objects, particularly the skulls, in their homes. In Oaxaca, they commonly take the shape of skulls, crowns, crucifixes, the dead and are made from crystallized sugar with honey in the center. In the State of Mexico, the most common objects are coffins, hearses, deer, sheep, angels, fruit, and skulls made of white sugar paste. In Puebla, the most common objects are skulls and coffins and the main ingredients include almonds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds mixed with sugar and egg, in the style of an almond paste.\n"}

The SAP implementation method described in this entry is a generic method and not a specific implementation method as such. It is based on best practices and case studies from various literature sources and presents a collection of processes and products that make up a complete implementation method to allow any organization to plan and execute the implementation of SAP software.\n\nThe implement of SAP software, such as SAP R/3 is almost always a massive operation that brings a lot of changes in the organization. The whole process can take up to several years. Virtually every person in the organization is involved, whether they are part of the SAP technical support organization (TSO) or the actual end-users of the SAP software. The resulting changes that the implementation of SAP generates are intended to reach high level goals, such as improved communication and increased return on information (as people will work with the same information). It is therefore important that the implementation process is planned and executed using a solid method. There are various SAP implementation methods. An example of how one company, Robert Bosch GmbH, implemented SAP R/3 over 10 years is available. This study shows that designing IT architecture is critical in SAP implementation practices.\n\nIEEE scholar journal reports an industrial case in which the senior management successfully dealt with a troubled SAP R/3 implementation in an international fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company during 2001 and 2002. (Lui 2008)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of all of the activities that form the SAP implementation process. These activities will be described with more detail and elaborated with examples in the rest of this entry.\n\nMission Key is also what defines slack.\n\nDesign and initially staff the SAP TSO\n\nThe first major step of the project preparation phase is to design and initially staff an SAP technical support organization (TSO), which is the organization that is charged with addressing and designing a\nCraft solution vision.\n\nThe second project preparation job is to define a so-called solution vision, i.e. a vision of the future-state of the SAP solution, where it is important to address both business and financial requirements (budgets). The main focus within the vision should be on the company’s core business and how the SAP solution will better enable that core business to be successful. Next to that, the shortcomings of the current systems should be described and short but clear requirements should be provided regarding availability (uptime), security, manageability and scalability of the SAP system.\n\nThe next phase is often referred to as the sizing and blueprinting phase and forms the main chunk of the implementation process. The phase is illustrated below.\n\nThis phase starts with performing a total cost of ownership analysis (TCO analysis) to determine how to get the best business solution at the lowest costs. This means to compare SAP solution stack options and alternatives and then determine what costs each part of the stack will bring and when these costs will be incurred. Parts of the stack are for example the hardware, operating system and database, which form the acquisition costs. Next to that, there should be taken a look at recurring costs like maintenance costs and downtime costs. Instead of performing a complete TCO analysis for various solution stack alternatives that would like to compare, it can be wise just to do a so-called delta analysis, where only the differences between solutions (stacks) are identified and analyzed. The image at the right depicts the essence of a delta analysis.\n\nIdentify high availability and disaster recovery requirements\n\nThe next step is identifying the high availability requirements and the more serious disaster recovery requirements. This is to plan what to do with later downtime of the SAP system, caused by e.g. hardware failures, application failures or power outages. It should be noted that it is very important to calculate the cost of downtime, so that an organization has a good idea of its actual availability requirements.\n\nEngage SAP solution stack vendors\n\nA true sizing process is to engage the SAP solution stack vendors, which is the next step. This means selecting the best SAP hardware and software technology partners for all layers and components of the solution stack, based on a side-by-side sizing comparison. The most important factors that are of influence here are the estimated numbers of (concurrent) users and batch sizes. A wise thing to do is to involve SAP SE itself to let them create a sizing proposal stating the advised solution stack, before moving to SAP’s technology partners/SAP vendors, like Accenture, HP and IBM. A simplified solution stack is depicted at the right, showing the many layers for which software and hardware has to be acquired. Note the overlap with the OSI model.\n\nStaff TSO\n\nThe TSO (Technical Support Organisation) is the most important resource for an organization that is implementing SAP, so staffing the TSO is a vital job which can consume a lot of time. In a previous phase, the organization should already have staffed the most vital positions. At this point the organization should staff the bulk of the TSO, i.e. fill the positions that directly support the near-term objectives of the implementation, which are to develop and begin the installation/implementation of the SAP data center. Examples are: data center experts, network infrastructure experts, security specialists and database administration experts.\n\nThere are many ways to find the right people within or outside the organization for all of the TSO positions and it depends on the organization how much time it wants to spend on staffing.\n\nTraining\n\nOne of the most vital stages of the implementation process is training. Few people within an organization are SAP experts or even have worked with SAP software. It is therefore important to train the end users but especially the SAP TSO: the people who design and implement the solution. The usual activity is to train a group of key users who in turn train the staff (source: practicalsap.com). The organisation's key users must be involved in the implementation project and testing of the system. Many people within the TSO need all kinds of training. Some examples of these positions:\n\n\nAll of these people need to acquire the required SAP knowledge and skills or even SAP certifications through training. Moreover, people need to learn to do business in a totally new way. To define how much SAP training every person needs, a company can make use of a skillset matrix. With this matrix, a manager can identify who possesses what knowledge, to manage and plan training, by defining the height of expertise with a number between e.g. 1 and 4 for each skill for each employee.\n\nSetup SAP data center\n\nThe next step is to set up the SAP data center. This means either building a new data center facility or transforming the current data center into a foundation capable of supporting the SAP solution stack, i.e. all of the technology layers and components (SAP software products) in a productive SAP installation. The most important factor when designing the data center is availability. The high availability and disaster recovery requirements which should have been defined earlier, give a good idea of the required data center requirements to host the SAP software. Data center requirements can be a:\n\n\nPerform installations\n\nThe following step is to install the required SAP software parts which are called components and technological foundations like a web application server or enterprise portals, to a state ready for business process configuration. The most vital sub steps are to prepare your OS, prepare the database server and then start installing SAP software. Here it is important to use installation guides, which are published for each SAP component or technology solution by SAP SE. Examples of SAP components are:\n\n\nRound out support for SAP\n\nBefore moving into the functional development phase, the organization should identify and staff the remaining TSO roles, e.g. roles that relate to helpdesk work and other such support providing work.\n\nThe next phase is the functional development phase, where it is all about change management and testing. This phase is depicted below.\n\nAddress change management\n\nThe next challenge for an organization is all about change management / change control, which means to develop a planned approach to the changes the organization faces. The objective here is to maximize the collective efforts of all people involved in the change and to minimize the risk of failure of implementing the changes related to the SAP implementation.\n\nThe implementation of SAP software will most surely come with many changes and an organization can expect many natural reactions, i.e. denial, to these changes. To fight this, it is most important to create a solid project team dedicated to change management and to communicate the solution vision and goals of this team. This team should be prepared to handle the many change issues that come from various sources like:\n\n\nSAP systems and operations management\n\nNext thing is to create a foundation for the SAP systems management and SAP computer operations, by creating a SAP operations manual and by evaluating SAP management applications. The manual is a collection of current state system documentation, day-to-day and other regularly scheduled operations tasks, various installation and operations checklists and how-to process documents.\n\nFunctional, integration and regression testing\n\nTesting is important before going live with any system. Before going live with a SAP system, it is vital to do many different kinds of testing, since there is often a large, complex infrastructure of hardware and software involved. Both requirements as well as quality parameters are to be tested. Important types of testing are:\n\n\nAll tests should be preceded by creating solid test plans.\n\nAgreements will be met. This can be done with SAP’s standard application benchmarks, to benchmark the organization’s configurations against configurations that have been tested by SAP’s hardware technology partners. Again, a test plan should be created at first.\n\nPrepare for cutover\n\nThe final phase before going live with SAP is often referred to as the cutover phase, which is the process of transitioning from one system to a new one. The organization needs to plan, prepare and execute the cutover, by creating a cutover plan that describes all cutover tasks that have to be performed before the actual go-live. Examples of cutover tasks are:\n\n\nAll of the previously described phases all lead towards this final moment: the go-live. Go-live means to turn on the SAP system for the end-users and to obtain feedback on the solution and to monitor the solution. It is also the moment where product software adoption comes into play. More information on this topic:\n\nIn order to successfully implement SAP in an organization, there are several things that are of great importance:\n\n1) Choose the correct SAP Consultants to have the correct blueprint.\nA SAP Consultant is a professional who has the skills to speak to the managers of a company and help them creating the blueprint. For this the SAP Consultant has the business skills of the business area he/she is working with, and also masters this area on SAP. For example, if this is SAP FI (accountancy) Consultant, this person is an expert on accountancy and payments, gained through experience or by the corresponding studies at the University. Also this person knows SAP FI because has gained by the corresponding training, or the course on the SAP Partner Academy or similar.\nBenefits: As this person knows about Accountancy he or she will understand the needs of the business and will bring it into reality.\n\n2) SAP R/3 implementation is not an IT project, in fact is an Organization Project impacting all levels of a company. So it is important to get the support from all the people that are involved in implementing SAP, but more important the participation and commitment of all levels, especially managers, of the company.\n\n3) The Blueprint is the keystone used as the lighthouse who must guide the whole project. A blueprint should never be a merely mapping of IT systems. In fact a blueprint is bringing the strategy of a company into execution through defining its processes across all business areas. Many projects have failed because the focus was on having people with SAP knowledge, but with no business skills. Just remember, processes must change across time, and a manual error automated could be repeated infinitely.\n\n4) Always consider changing the way things have been done before implementing SAP. \"This has always been done like this and the Consultant should replicate it on SAP\" is the start of a big problem. SAP many times could save you time and money as it allows your organization to automate many processes.\n\n5) Test the SAP hardware and software rigorously by testing your business processes, and to ensure that the end-users are ready to use SAP before going live, because there are many known projects that failed because of a lack of support and SAP knowledge.\n\n6) Design and execute a Change Management Program by communicating as early as needed all the information that end users should have to accept the new technology and designing and executing a training plan in order to reassure a knowledge base within the organizations.\n\n7) Ensure executive alignment early in the project by making sure the project team, executive leadership, and SAP Implementation partner are aligned on the project objectives and success criteria.\n\n\n"}

The crust has a nutty taste, the tomato sauce is sometimes spicy, the toppings are under the cheese, and the pizza is cut into strips.\n\nThe first business to bring \"quad city\" style pizza to the public was Frank's Pizza in 1955. \n\nTony's Club Capri was the only sit-down style restaurant and bar. Phyllis Maniscalco, Tony's wife, worked the cash registers, helped in the kitchen when needed and helped manage the business overall. Throughout the years, Tony’s children Giana and Tony Jr. as well as other family members would also help out in the various locations. The sausage was always handmade and Tony would pre-mix his spices by hand and measure them out in bags for his employees to then mix with the ground pork he butchered himself. Cheese was always grated in house and imported from a Chicago area supplier. In addition to pizza, Tony served up Italian beef sandwiches, Stromboli, house-made sausages, a variety of pasta dishes with his own signature marinara sauce. Desserts included spumoni ice cream and cannoli. This was his first location to offer more than just pizza.\n\nTony Sr.’s brother Frank Maniscalco also moved to the Quad Cities upon hearing of his brother’s success and decided to open up an additional location called Frank’s in Davenport off of Locust St. This is not to be confused with Frank’s in Silvis, IL. Tony Sr. was friends with the Serra Family and they had approached Tony Sr. about his recipe as they wanted to start a restaurant in Minnesota. Tony obliged and after the Minnesota location failed, the Serra’s came back to Tony Sr. and asked if they could open up in the Quad Cities. Since Tony Sr. did not have any restaurants in the Silvis/East Moline area at the time, it was decided that they would open a location in 1955 which still stands to this day – Frank’s Club Napoli Pizza in Silvis, IL. Also, contrary to popular belief, Harris Pizza was not the original “Quad Cities Style Pizza”. Leonard and his wife Mary owned a small package liquor store in Rock Island, IL. Patrons often requested food and Leonard saw this as an opportunity to expand his business. In 1960, an employee of Tony Sr. named Dick Kennedy who also happened to be a good friend of Leonard Harris had helped the Harris Family develop the base recipe for Harris’ that they still use to this day.\n\nIn addition to the brick and mortar locations, Tony Sr. also made a name for himself in the grocery store’s freezer section. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Tony had started delivering par-baked/half-baked pizzas to the local A&P grocery stores. These were the first frozen pizzas in the Quad Cities at the time. In 1968, Tony Sr.’s pizza businesses and the recipes were sold to the family of Mama Bosso's, who to this day still make pizzas you can purchase in the freezer section of local Quad Cities grocers such as Hy-vee.\n\nAfter that sale, Tony Sr. decided to venture into the home improvement business, but the restaurant industry still called his name. He would go on to open two additional locations in the 1970s – one in East Moline and one in the Wells Fargo Bowling Alley (where Clint’s used to be on the Avenue of the Cities in Moline). Tony finally got out of the restaurant business in the late 1970s when these locations were sold. He continued to work in home improvement until his untimely passing on July 6th, 1994.\n\nQuad City-style pizza dough contains a \"spice jam\", which is heavy on malt, which lends a toasted, nutty flavor. The pizzas are hand-tossed to be stretched into an even quarter-inch thin crust with a slight lip ringing the edge. The sauce contains both red chili flakes and ground cayenne, and the smooth, thin tomato spread is more spicy than sweet. The sausage is typically a thick blanket of lean, fennel-flecked Italian sausage sometimes ground twice and spread from edge to edge. The pizzas are cooked using a special gas oven with an average cooking time of about 12 minutes. The pizza is cut into strips, as opposed to being cut in slices. An average 16-inch pizza has about 14 strips, and a 10-inch pizza has about 10 strips.\n\nThe dish originates in the Quad Cities region of the United States. Cities highlighted in Blue are outside of the QC metro region. Purveyors as of November 2017 include:\n\nThe dish has been prepared in other areas of the United States, including Mahtomedi, Minnesota, Mesa, Arizona West Des Moines, and Chicago.

{"id": "35275877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35275877", "title": "Virgin boy egg", "text": "Virgin boy egg\n\nVirgin boy eggs are a traditional dish of Dongyang, Zhejiang, China in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten. Named \"tong zi dan\" (Chinese: 童子蛋; pinyin: \"Tóngzǐdàn\"), the dish translates literally to \"boy egg\" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's \"local intangible cultural heritage\".\n\nThe dish is a long-standing tradition of Dongyang and its practices date back centuries. In general, China has had a long history of food preservation methods. Tea eggs were originally developed to preserve the food for long periods of time. While the boy eggs may not have necessarily had the same origin, their development comes from a similar cultural background. There is no good explanation for why it must be boys' urine, specifically. It has simply been so for centuries. However, it is historically believed in the region that urine has various health benefits and was commonly ingested in ancient times. In such times, eggs were one of the only nutritional food items available to peasants and farmers. Due to Zhejiang's hilly and riverside landscapes, agriculture has been a staple in the region's culture for centuries. Although rice was the most widely grown crop, most peasants raised their own pigs and poultry on their land as well. This led to the eggs' availability to the common person and, with the supposedly added benefit of urine at the time, the virgin boy eggs grew in popularity. The dish's traditional nature stems from the historical tendency of Chinese food culture to place more care on the detailed history of a specific food. Virgin boy eggs are one example of how Chinese food culture attaches more importance to the anecdotes relating to food, such as its time of invention or the significant historical figures related to the food's invention. This differs historically from the western food culture which places more importance on a dish's ingredients and the skills necessary for its preparation. Although the exact history is somewhat obscure to most official sources, the long-standing trend of Chinese food explains the people of Dongyang's loyalty to a traditional dish to which many others find an aversion.\n\nThe dish is prepared by first soaking the eggs in the urine of young boys. The urine is sourced locally by each vendor. Then, the mixture is heated over a stove. After boiling, the egg shells are cracked around the entire surface of the egg. Afterwards, the eggs are placed back into the urine. The used urine is then replaced with fresh urine and the process is repeated. The soaking process allows the eggs to become cured in the urine as they are left to simmer. The entire process is generally a day-long endeavor. According to some recipes, different herbs may also be added to the marinade. When finished, the eggs whites have a pale golden hue and the yolks turn green. Virgin boy eggs are similar to century eggs in their curing process and historical roots, although century eggs have become much more popularly widespread and do not use urine.\n\nVirgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures. Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine. The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill. In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys. Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs. However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, \"The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it. It stinks.” In general, virgin boy eggs remain highly acclaimed by the people of Dongyang for both their taste and even their \"fragrant\" smell.\n\nUrine therapy has been a significant part of traditional Chinese medicine for much of its history. In ancient times, urine was used as a means of enhancing the effects of medicine, although today, the practice is widely viewed as unsanitary by many. It is widely speculated, however, that when urine dries it crystallizes resulting in a substance similar to the Chinese medicine, ren zhong bai. The crystallized urine sediment is said to aid in the mitigation of inflammation and inflammatory diseases as well as fungal infections of the skin and mouth. Some claim that the ingestion of the urine-soaked eggs can treat yin deficiency, decrease one's internal body heat, and promote blood circulation. Locals claim, based on anecdotal evidence, that the eggs also prevent heat stroke. Although not the only one, it was widely believed in ancient China that eggs cured in one's own urine for seven days and consumed for a course of three months was a cure for chronic asthma. Among other uses for urine in Chinese medicine, a young boy's first urine of the day is very powerful and may be combined with herbs to make a tonic. Modern medical practitioners remain dubious of any health benefits of urine therapy in general. Skepticism comes from the fact that urination is a bodily mechanism for excreting waste. Evidence-based modern medicine has determined that urine \"is waste expelled from the human body and basically contains no substance conducive to human health.\" Eating the eggs is therefore discouraged by many medical practitioners.\n\n"}

Varieties include Presidente (5.0% ABV) and Presidente Light (4.3 ABV.)\n\nIn 1929, U.S. industrialist Charles H. Wanzer with other business partners founded the brewery and started brewing the iconic Dominican beer, Presidente, in 1935. The beer was named in honor of then Dominican president Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Presidente was initially launched as a dark beer and acquired limited success, yet in the 1960s Presidente was transformed into the pilsner that is recognized today. In 1986, the brewery was acquired by Dominican cigarette company Grupo León Jimenes. More recently, in 2012, AmBev acquired majority ownership from Grupo León Jimenes, and is looking to expand Presidente’s market. Presidente is now owned by AB-InBev.\n\nSome of Presidente's export partners include the University of Miami Hurricanes, the Miami Marlins, and the Miami Heat. In 2007, Presidente was the official beer of the University of Miami Hurricanes, NCAA football team as well as the Orange Bowl in Miami. In 2009, Presidente became the Miami Heat's official imported beer. In 2012, Presidente became an official sponsor of the Miami Marlins. It was even mentioned in 2012 by former Marlins Manager, Ozzie Guillén, as a cure after being defeated 15-5 versus the Boston Red Sox: \n\nEvery year since 2007, Presidente has also hosted Festival Presidente de Música Latina (Presidente Festival of Latin Music), which is a three-day event in October that showcases Dominican and International musical talent. It is held at the Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\n\n"}

It began in the early 20th century in the Franconian Switzerland region of Upper Franconia but has spread to other regions. The decoration is usually kept from Good Friday until two weeks after Easter.\n\nDecorating a well for Easter honours water, essential for life, and Easter, the feast of renewed life. In addition to eggs (now often artificial, to guard against vandalism), paper ribbons called \"Pensala\" and garlands of evergreens are woven around well-heads or formed into crowns over them. In several locations flowers are also used.\n\nThe Franconian Switzerland (), so called for its rugged rock outcroppings, lies in the region of Upper Franconia in northern Bavaria. The tradition of Osterbrunnen began there in the early 20th century. The Osterbrunnen in Aufseß is said to have been first decorated around 1909; that in the village of Engelhardsberg has been dressed since 1913. After World War II, public wells became less important, reducing the amount of decoration. However, beginning in 1952, Dr. Kunstmann and his wife, of Nuremberg, worked to revive the tradition in Franconian Switzerland. During the 1980s the idea spread to other parts of Upper Franconia. The decorated wells became a tourist attraction; the wells in Heiligenstadt and Bieberbach are destinations for bus tours from cities such as Munich and Dresden. Heiligenstadt is visited by some 80 buses a day. The fountain in Bieberbach was listed in 2001 in the \"Guinness World Records\" for 11,108 hand-painted eggshells.\n\nThe tradition of the Osterbrunnen has also spread outside Franconia to Hesse and to the Steigerwald, to the valley of the Altmühl, to Saxony, to the Palatinate, to the Saarland and to Swabia.\n\nThere was an old tradition throughout Germany of drawing water in silence at Easter for purification and medical treatment, which was sometimes referred to as Osterbrunnen. Wells were cleaned and decorated with garlands and sometimes eggs in May, a tradition which survived relatively late in the 19th century in Bacharach. Other dates for well decorating included Pentecost in southern Thuringia and Midsummer in Fulda; it took place at Easter in Bohemia. Nineteenth-century writers, particularly Karl Weinhold, suggested that these traditions of well cleaning and decorating were remnants of pre-Christian practices. In work first published in 1987, Claudia Schillinger has argued for a Wendish origin of the decoration of wells in Franconia.\n\n\n\n"}

Begun privately in 1871, it was put under federal supervision and maintenance several years later. It is still an important component of the harbor facilities.\n\nIn its current configuration, the canal is defined by a pair of breakwaters long and apart, constructed of concrete set on timber and stone cribbing. The canal is maintained at wide and LWD, allowing passage of ocean-going ships. Three lighthouses are placed on the sides of the canal: the Duluth North Pier Light and the Duluth South Breakwater Outer Light mark the lake ends of the canal, while the Duluth South Breakwater Inner Light functions with the south breakwater light as a range light. At the harbor end, the canal is straddled by the Aerial Lift Bridge which connects Minnesota Point to the rest of the city. On the north side, there is a building housing the local Corps of Engineers administration, as well as the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center. There are no locks; most ships transit the canal under their own power, though tug service is available in case of adverse weather. Around a thousand vessels a year ship from the Duluth–Superior port.\n\nThe construction of the first locks on the St. Marys River in 1855 allowed for navigation between the lakes, and Superior Bay presented itself as an attractive harbor. From the point of view of Duluth residents, however, arrangements were less than satisfactory, as ships from that city had to pass Superior, Wisconsin on the way to the lake, as the only natural outlet was between Minnesota Point and Wisconsin Point at the far end of the bay. Also, while sheltered, the bay was not naturally as deep as was desirable, and the canal was convoluted. In 1865 a harbor was constructed outside the bay using a breakwater, and this was gradually improved over the next several years. A storm in 1871 destroyed the structure, and though it was rebuilt the next year, it was abandoned in 1878 due to ongoing ice and storm damage.\n\nAn 1866 report by Lt. Col. W. F. Raynolds of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers recommended cutting a canal through Minnesota Point, but due to the cost, no action was taken. Instead, a massive federal effort was undertaken to improve facilities in Superior. At the same time, the city of Duluth combined forces with the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad to dig a canal on their own. This began in 1870, and politicians in Wisconsin, seeing traffic through Superior threatened, went to the war department to have construction stopped, eventually obtaining an injunction on July 13, 1871. They were too late. The canal was completed two months earlier, with local lore holding that on April 30, 1871, a group of city residents, summoned by brewer (soon to be mayor) Sidney Luce, came to the site with shovels and picks and dug the first connection between the bay and the lake.\n\nThe injunction was soon lifted, at the cost of building a dike from Rice's Point to Minnesota Point, thus isolating the canal from the main flow of the Saint Louis River, which fed the bay and which formed the border between the rival cities. The dike did not last long; it suffered ice damage from the start and was gradually removed in the course of dredging. Federal responsibility for the latter, a result of the 1873 River and Harbor Act, gradually expanded into jurisdiction over all facilities in the area, with the Corps of Engineers taking over the canal in 1887.\n\nThe canal remains under the control of the Corps of Engineers to the present. In 1889, however, an attempt was made by Wilhelm Boeing, a Detroit businessman, to charge tolls for use of the canal. Boeing, the father of aircraft manufacturer William Boeing, owned property on both sides of the canal as well as thousands of acres of timber near Chisholm, and in 1888 his attorney had a string stretched across the entry to the canal to claim the right to charge tolls. This came to nothing, but the following October, flyers were distributed to shipping offices stating that a rope would be stretched across the canal on the fifteenth of the month to deny passage to all vessels. It is unclear what Boeing's intentions were, or whether he carried out his threat; but in any case his death the next month ended the matter.\n\nThe canal was, from the beginning, defined by piers along either side. These were initially timber cribs put in place by the city, albeit with some federal funding. They did not stand up to the harsh winter weather and required substantial maintenance every few years, up until an 1896 project to rebuild the canal. It was this project that gave the two piers their present form, with the new south pier completed in 1901, and the north pier completed the following year. In 1906 the present administration building was completed; this was enlarged in the 1940s, and a visitor's center and museum was added to that in 1973. A maintenance yard was constructed on the south side of the canal. The famous bridge was constructed in 1905 to provide access to Minnesota Point, which was cut off from the mainland by construction of the canal.\n"}

{"id": "35700581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35700581", "title": "Pensacola culture", "text": "Pensacola culture\n\nThe Pensacola culture was a regional variation of the Mississippian culture along the Gulf Coast of the United States that lasted from 1100 to 1700 CE. The archaeological culture covers an area stretching from a transitional Pensacola/Fort Walton culture zone at Choctawhatchee Bay in Florida to the eastern side of the Mississippi River Delta near Biloxi, Mississippi, with the majority of its sites located along Mobile Bay in the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta. Sites for the culture stretched inland, north into the southern Tombigee and Alabama River valleys, as far as the vicinity of Selma, Alabama.\n\nBoth the Pensacola culture and the nearby Fort Walton culture were a mixture of the Late Woodland period Weeden Island culture that preceded them in the area and an influx of Mississippian culture peoples from further north. Originally Pensacola and Fort Walton had been classified together under the Pensacola name by archaeologists, named for a group of sites located around Pensacola Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay, the approximate geographic center of their combined areas. However further study of their differing ceramic technologies over the years has led archaeologists to reclassify them as two separate cultures. Further archaeological research has also determined that the Bottle Creek site (the largest Pensacola culture site, which is located north of Mobile Bay) was the actual center for the culture and that there are more Pensacola sites in that area and around Perdido Bay than in the Pensacola area.\n\nThe peoples of the Early Pensacola culture were closely tied to the people of the Moundville polity located upstream from them and were possibly the result of colonization from the Moundville area. They used the more typical Mississippian culture shell tempering for their pottery. Whereas the Fort Walton peoples, whose largest site was Lake Jackson Mounds in Tallahassee, were more closely tied to and influenced by the Etowah polity of northern Georgia and like them used mostly sand, grit, grog, or combinations of these materials as tempering agents in their pottery. The early ceramics of Pensacola culture also show that they had significant contact with Plaquemine Mississippian culture peoples from the Lower Mississippi Valley. Archaeological research at the Bottle Creek site has shown that the people of the Pensacola culture may have moved into this geographical area from the north and west, but by the fourteenth century they had developed their own distinctive ceramics style and their own unique settlement pattern. Unlike their Fort Walton neighbors to the east, Pensacola peoples relied more on the use of coastal resources than on maize agriculture. The settlement pattern of the Pensacola culture area suggests that the area was a series of minor chiefdoms with their own local centers such as Fort Walton Mound with one large paramount chiefdom located at the Bottle Creek site. The site is the largest on the Gulf Coast and with 18 mounds is comparable in scale to Moundville and the Plaquemine Mississippian Holly Bluff Site in western Mississippi. By 1250 CE Pensacola peoples had begun trading with Coastal Coles Creek culture peoples in southeastern Louisiana. Their style of pottery was found to be influential on peoples in this area, with many examples as well as local derivatives found at the Sims Site in Saint Charles Parish, Louisiana.\n\nArchaeological excavations at the Bottle Creek site have shown that it had continued to be inhabited during the time of European contact from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth century, although it is still uncertain which historic groups these people may be. The Pensacola culture peoples first contact with Europeans may have been with the Narváez expedition in 1528. Cabeza de Vaca reported that the Native Americans they encountered in the vicinity of what is now Pensacola Bay were of \"large stature and well formed,\" and lived in permanent houses. The chief wore a robe of what de Vaca called \"civet-marten\", \"the best [skins], I think, that can be found.\" After initially appearing to be friendly, they attacked the Spaniards without warning during the night.\nIn 1539 Diego Maldonado, exploring the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico under orders from Hernando de Soto, found Pensacola Bay (which the Spanish called the Bay of Achuse, Achusi, Ochuse or Ochus). Maldonado found a village on the bay, where he seized one or two of the inhabitants, along with a \"good blanket of sables.\" De Soto ordered Maldonado to meet him at the Bay of Achuse the next summer with supplies for his expedition. Maldonado returned three years in succession, but de Soto never appeared. It is possible that the Pensacola culture peoples were connected to or were the central Alabama Mabilians disastrously encountered by de Soto in 1540. The next mention of the Mabilians is in 1674 by Bishop Gabriel Diaz Vara Calderon, who places them on an island in west Florida, possibly the swampy high ground of Mound Island where the Bottle Creek site is located or Dauphin Island. Later historic Mabilian villages are closer geographically to Bottle Creek and the nearby city of Mobile, Alabama was named for them.\n\nIn 1559 Tristán de Luna y Arellano led a Spanish expedition to establish the colony of Ochuse on Pensacola Bay, then known as the Bay of Ichuse (also spelled Ychuse), but the endeavor ended up being short-lived. The Spanish had planned to rely on the local peoples for food supplies, but they found the area almost deserted and only a few people living in fishing camps around the bay.\n\nBy the early eighteenth century the Pensacola people, a Muskogean speaking group associated with the Fort Walton culture Apalachee Province, were living in the western part of what is now the Florida Panhandle and are the source of the name for Pensacola Bay, the city of Pensacola and later the Pensacola culture. They inhabited the area until the mid-eighteenth century, but by 1764 they had been assimilated into various Choctaw or Creek bands that had moved into the area or westward with the Biloxi to merge with the Tunica as part of the Tunica-Biloxi.\n\n\n"}

Some areas of employment for public health nurses are school districts, county or state health departments, and departments of correction. The public health nurse looks for areas of concern within the community and assesses and plans ways through which the concerns can be resolved or minimized. Some health concerns a public health nurse may work on are infection control, health maintenance, health coaching, as well as home care visits for welfare and to provide care to certain members of the community who may need it.\n\n"}

{"id": "35819153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35819153", "title": "Names of Vietnam", "text": "Names of Vietnam\n\nViệt Nam () is a variation of Nam Việt (Southern Việt), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu dynasty (Nanyue Kingdom of Chinese in 2nd century BC). The word \"Việt\" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word \"Việt Nam\", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm. \"Annam\", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan Bội Châu revived the name \"Vietnam\" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, \"Vietnam.\" However, \"Viet Nam\" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government.\n\nThroughout history, there were many names used to refer to Vietnam. Besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was called Văn Lang during the Hùng Vương Dynasty, Âu Lạc when An Dương was king, Nam Việt during the Triệu Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior Lý Dynasty, Đại Cồ Việt during the Đinh dynasty and Early Lê dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called Đại Việt (Great Viet). During the Hồ dynasty, Vietnam was called Đại Ngu.\n\nThe term \"\" (Yue) (), Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as \"越\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.\n\nFrom the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular states or groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, ; ). The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" compiled around 239 BC.\n\nIn 207 BC, former Qin dynasty general Zhao Tuo/Triệu Đà founded the kingdom Nanyue/Nam Việt () with its capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou). This kingdom was \"southern\" in the sense that it was located south of other Baiyue kingdoms such as Minyue and Ouyue, located in modern Fujian and Zhejiang. Several later Vietnamese dynasties followed this nomenclature even after these more northern peoples were absorbed into China.\n\nIn \"Sấm Trạng Trình\" (The Prophecies of Trạng Trình), poet Nguyen Binh Khiêm (1491–1585) reversed the traditional order of the syllables and put the name in its modern form: \"Vietnam is being created\" (). At this time, the country was divided between the Trịnh lords of Hanoi and the Nguyễn lords of Huế. By combining several existing names, Nam Việt, Annam (Pacified South), Đại Việt (Great Việt), and \"Nam quốc\" (southern nation), Khiêm could create a new name that referred to an aspirational unified state. The word \"nam\" no longer implies Southern Việt, but rather that Vietnam is \"the South\" in contrast to China, \"the North\". This explanation is implied by Lý Thường Kiệt in the poem \"Nam quốc sơn hà\" (1077): \"Over the mountains and rivers of the South, reigns the emperor of the South.\" Researcher Nguyễn Phúc Giác Hải found the word 越南 \"Việt Nam\" on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bảo Lâm Pagoda, Haiphong (1558). Nguyễn Phúc Chu (1675–1725) used the word in a poem: \"This is the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam\" (). It was used as an official name by Emperor Gia Long in 1804-1813. The Jiaqing Emperor refused Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Việt, and changed the name instead to Việt Nam. Gia Long's Đại Nam thực lục contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.\n\n\"Trung Quốc\" 中國 or the 'Middle Country' was used as a name for Vietnam by Gia Long in 1805. Minh Mang used the name \"Trung Quốc\" 中國 to call Vietnam. Vietnamese Nguyen Emperor Minh Mạng sinicized ethnic minorities such as Cambodians, claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China's Han dynasty for Vietnam, and used the term Han people 漢人 to refer to the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that \"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\" This policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes. The Nguyen lord Nguyen Phuc Chu had referred to Vietnamese as \"Han people\" in 1712 when differentiating between Vietnamese and Chams. Chinese clothing was forced on Vietnamese people by the Nguyễn.\n\nThe use of \"Vietnam\" was revived in modern times by nationalists including Phan Bội Châu, whose book \"Việt Nam vong quốc sử\" (History of the Loss of Vietnam) was published in 1906. Chau also founded the Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội (Vietnam Restoration League) in 1912. However, the general public continued to use Annam and the name \"Vietnam\" remained virtually unknown until the Yên Bái mutiny of 1930, organized by the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party). By the early 1940s, the use of \"Việt Nam\" was widespread. It appeared in the name of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Viet Minh), founded 1941, and was even used by the governor of French Indochina in 1942. The name \"Vietnam\" has been official since 1945. It was adopted in June by Bảo Đại's imperial government in Huế, and in September by Ho's rival communist government in Hanoi.\n\n\nIn English, the spellings Vietnam, Viet-Nam, and Viet Nam have all been used. The 1954 edition of \"Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\" gave both the unspaced and hyphenated forms; in response to a letter from a reader, the editors indicated that the spaced form Viet Nam was also acceptable, though they stated that because Anglophones did not know the meaning of the two words making up the name Vietnam, \"it is not surprising\" that there was a tendency to drop the space. In 1966, the U.S. government was known to use all three renderings, with the State Department preferring the hyphenated version. By 1981, the hyphenated form was regarded as \"dated\", according to Scottish writer Gilbert Adair, and he titled his book about depictions of the country in film using the unhyphenated and unspaced form \"Vietnam\".\n\nThe modern Chinese name for Vietnam () can be translated as \"Beyond the South\", leading to the folk etymology that the name is a reference to the country's location beyond the southernmost borders of China. Another theory explains that the nation was termed as such in order to emphasize the division of those who stayed in China in contrast to the people living in Vietnam.\n\nBoth Japanese and Korean formerly referred to Vietnam by their respective Sino-Xenic pronunciations of the Chinese characters for its names, but later switched to using direct phonetic transcriptions. In Japanese, following the independence of Vietnam the names \"Annan\" (安南) and \"Etsunan\" (越南) were largely replaced by the phonetic transcription \"Betonamu\" (ベトナム), written in katakana script; however, the old form is still seen in compound words (e.g. 訪越, \"a visit to Vietnam\"). Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sometimes used an alternative spelling \"Vietonamu\" (ヴィエトナム). Similarly, in the Korean language, in line with the trend towards decreasing usage of hanja, the Sino-Korean-derived name \"Wollnam\" (월남, the Korean reading of 越南) has been replaced by \"Beteunam\" (베트남) in South Korea and \"Wetnam\" (윁남) in North Korea.\n\n"}

In Indonesia, the dish is recognized as a popular Chinese Indonesian dish, served from simple travelling vendor carts frequenting residential areas, humble street-side \"warung\" to restaurants.\n\nThe yellow wheat noodle is boiled in water until it achieves an al dente texture and mixed in a bowl with cooking oil, soy sauce and garlic.

{"id": "35954219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35954219", "title": "History of scrolls", "text": "History of scrolls\n\nA scroll (from the Old French \"escroe\" or \"escroue\"), is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper containing writing. The history of scrolls dates back to ancient Egypt. In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound books; rigid media such as clay tablets were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the codex book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish Torah scroll for use in synagogues.\n\nScrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations.\n\nParchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the codex or bound book with pages and was invented by the Romans in the 1st century AD. Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.\n\nThe Hebrew tradition assumes that the Torah was copied by Moses onto a scroll (in about 1200 BCE) made from skin of a kosher animal, rather than papyrus as in Dynastic Egypt. Since there is no historical evidence for Moses and the events related in the Torah, there is no reliable way to know the time when Hebrews started using scrolls for their religious books.\n\nFollowing Jewish tradition, since that time scrolls, which are very durable with examples known to be hundreds of years old such as the 800-year-old Sephardic Sefer Torah from Spain, are copied from one to another.\n\nThe meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 person-hours (about one year at 40 hours per week). \n\nThe Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words). \nOther books of the Tanakh are also written in scroll form, as well as the small mezuzah scrolls found in the door frames of most orthodox, conservative and reform Jewish households. Some Jewish families own their own Megillah scroll for use during Purim.\n\nThere is a difference between the כְּתִיב (\"Ketiv\"), what is and must be written (in consonantal text, with vowels omitted), and the קְרֵי (\"Qere\"), what is read.\n\nThe Jewish communities in these countries used the same techniques to manufacture scrolls, but using deer skins. The scrolls from these areas were known for their quality and durability, and were later imported into European and Indian communities.\n\nNon-Jewish vellum manufacturing also took place after the 3rd century BC.\n\nScrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound.\n\nThe Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the codex, which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together.\n\nScrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the Early Middle Ages, but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex. It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews.\n\nScrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the Middle Ages, and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 0th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin. Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as \"rolls\", hence the Great Rolls of the English Exchequer, and titles such as Master of the Rolls (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century. The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the Palace of Westminster until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper. The Exultet Scroll from Southern Italy and Byzantine Joshua Scroll were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit.\n\nScrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an.\n\nScrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan.\n\nThe Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.), became common by the year 1200 B.C.\n\nLater other formats came into use in China, firstly the \"sutra\" or \"scripture\" binding, a scroll folded concertina-style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle. By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional painting and calligraphy in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a hanging scroll on a wall or horizontally and flat as a handscroll.\n\nThe codex was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.\n\nAnother aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.\n\nThe codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature. However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.\n\nTorah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice.\n\nSome cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a hanging scroll—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text.\n\nOne of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\", typed onto what he called \"the scroll\", made of taped-together sheets of paper.\n\nThe verb \"to scroll\" is much used in the age of screen displays—computer displays, rolling credits in films and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other.\n\n\n"}

The brand owes part of its evolution to the chemist D. Miguel Hernainz, who created Alhambra Reserva 1925 when the brand was going through a difficult period, along with other creations that followed. Despite the setbacks of the time in the midst of the Spanish Civil War, since 1936 Alhambra began growing and didn’t stop its production.\n\nIn 1954 it entered the shareholding of the Spanish company Damn and in 1979 Cruzcampo also became a part of the group. In the following decades, the company experienced years of growth and industrial modernization of its facilities.\n\nIn 1995 the company accumulated debts in the value of 600 million pesetas, which led it to renegotiate its debts with its creditors. In 1995 Cruzcampo and Damn abandoned the shareholding and Alhambra sold 99% of its shares to an external group at a low cost. In 1996 the company began to turn a profit. In 1998 the company made a profit of 300 million pesetas and in 1999 it bought the Andalusian Beer Company, producer of the Cordoba brand, Sureña, which was part of the Colombian group Bavaria.\n\nIn 2001 Heineken Group (owner of Cruzcampo and El Aguila) sued Alhambra to keep them from producing Aquila Negra. The suit was accompanied by a report from a detective that informed of the production of Aguila Negra by Alhambra.

Currently, Dennis' Horseradish has been sold as far north as Lindsay, Ontario where it is a featured item at their farmers' market.\n\nThe Dennis’ brand of horseradish is named after Dennis Gyorffy of the Gyorffy family who started their business in the basement of their home on North Street in Tillsonburg, Ontario in 1960.\n\nThe family was composed of Dennis and Mary Gyorffy and their sons Steve and Robert. All of the family pitched in to produce and distribute the product. The roots were purchased from Marshall Farms of Ancaster, Ontario. They were washed using wringer type washing machines. After cleaning and peeling, they were ground up in a large butcher type meat grinder attached by belt to an electric motor. Dennis experimented with various blades and screens in the grinder to achieve the desired consistency.\nThe only mechanical aid used at the time was a filling machine which could be adjusted to dispense the exact amount in each jar. Jar caps and labels were applied manually. The home on North Street had a walk-in cooler to store both the fresh roots and the finished product. The varieties of product produced at the time included:\n• Regular Horseradish\n• Creamed Horseradish\n• Beet and Horseradish Relish\n• Seafood Cocktail Sauce\n• Hot Mustard. \nThe family distributed their products from Windsor to Ottawa and as far north as Sudbury.

It is rice congee with shredded chicken meat served with some condiments, such as chopped scallion, crispy fried shallot, celery, \"tongcay\" (preserved salted vegetables), fried soybean, Chinese crullers (\"youtiao\", known as \"cakwe\" in Indonesia), and both salty and sweet soy sauce, and sometimes topped with yellow chicken broth and \"kerupuk\" (Indonesian-style crackers). Unlike many other Indonesian dishes, it is not spicy; \"sambal\" or chili paste is served separately. It is a favourite breakfast food, served by humble travelling vendors, \"warung\" (small local shops), fast food establishments, and five-star hotel restaurants. Travelling \"bubur ayam\" vendors frequently pass through residential streets in the morning selling the dish.\n\nThe origin of \"bubur ayam\" was derived from Chinese chicken congee. The traces of Chinese cuisine influences are the use of \"cakwe\" (\"youtiao\"), \"tongcay\" and soy sauce. \"Bubur ayam\" employs a wide range of poultry products, such as shredded chicken meat for the main dish and different dishes made with chicken offal as side delicacies. \"Bubur ayam\" is often eaten with the addition of boiled chicken egg, chicken liver, gizzard, intestines and \"uritan\" (premature chicken eggs acquired from butchered hens), served as \"satay\". There are some variants of \"bubur ayam\", such as \"bubur ayam Bandung\" and \"bubur ayam Sukabumi\", both from West Java. The later variant uses raw \"telur ayam kampung\" (lit. \"village chicken egg\", i.e. free-range eggs) buried under the hot rice congee to allow the egg to be half-cooked, with the other ingredients on top of the rice congee. The recipe and condiments of \"bubur ayam\" served by travelling vendors and \"warung\" are also slightly different with those served in fast food establishments or hotel restaurants.\n\nBecause this food is always served hot and with a soft texture, like \"soto ayam\" and \"nasi tim\", \"bubur ayam\" is known as comfort food in Indonesian culture. The soft texture of the rice congee and boneless chicken also makes this dish suitable for young children or adults in convalescence. Because of its popularity, \"bubur ayam\" has become one of the Asia-inspired fast food menu items at McDonald's Indonesia and Malaysia, and also at Kentucky Fried Chicken Indonesia. Although almost all recipes of \"bubur ayam\" use rice, a new variation, called \"bubur ayam havermut\", replaces rice with oats. In grocery stores, \"bubur ayam\" is also available as instant food, requiring only the addition of hot water.\n\n\n"}

It consists of a variety of dishes, based on geographical, cultural and climate features of the region, with fish traditionally featured heavily.\n\nFinnic tribes settled on the riversides, in places convenient for fishing. Traditionally Mordvians pay a great attention to the support of nature. Fish dishes varied by the type of cooking; fish was eaten raw, frozen, dried, salty, and boiled. Fish liver, fish eggs, milt, cod-liver oil were used as cooking ingredients.\n\nMeat and poultry was stewed, baked and boiled. There were no fried meat dishes in Finno-Ugric cuisine, only roasted dishes which also were borrowed from Tatar cuisine in the 19th century. Beef, mutton and pork were preserved in several ways. The most ancient preservation method was drying. Pre-boiled meat was dried at oven or under the Sun. Fat from broth was collected and used for cooking. Meat was also frozen for preservation.\n\nIn ancient times, horsemeat was used for food, but later it was used only in rituals (\"molyam\") associated with horse worship.\n\nMany farms grew cabbage, cucumbers, potatoes, garlic, carrots, beans, beets, turnips, radishes, and pumpkins. In summer and autumn, a great deal of fruit were eaten fresh. Pickled cucumbers were used for preparing dishes. Beets and pumpkins were eaten steamed as a dessert. \"Shschi\" (cabbage soup) was a traditional soup consisting of cabbage and potatoes cooked in chicken broth with onions and carrots added at the end. Herbs such as watercress, horseradish, onion, cow parsnip, horsetail, nettle, and wild goutweed were used for preparing dishes instead of spices.\n\nMushrooms were one of the main ingredients in traditional dishes. They were boiled, salted, fried, soured and dried.\n\nGrains had a special place in Mordovian cuisine. Finno-Ugric tribes mostly used wheat, barley, spelt and rye (black cereal). Ritual meals in Mordovia were associated with agricultural period, family and public holidays. For example, millet porridge was not only a delicious meal on weddings. christenings, funerals, but also there was a special ritual \"baba's porridge\" (female porridge) made at the last day of a bride at home.\n\nBliny (pancakes) were a favorite dish of Mordvians. They were called \"pachat\" and were made from rye, wheat, millet and pea flour. Traditionally Mordvians liked the pancakes to be rather thick and added boiled potatoes into the dough. Such pancakes were served with milk and honey.\n\n"}

Seafood dishes are usually developed within a cuisine or characteristic style of cooking practice and tradition, often associated with a specific culture. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence. Regional food preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create seafood dishes unique to a particular region.\n\nMany fish or seafood dishes have a specific names \"(sauerbraten)\", while others are simply described \"(fried fish)\" or named for particular places \"(Cullen skink)\". As with other food dishes, there can be a high level of culinary mythology concerning regional claims to particular seafood dishes, and it is not always clear where particular dishes originated.\n\nThere have been many significant improvements during the last century in food preservation, storage, shipping and production. Today, most countries, cities and regions have access to their traditional cuisines and many other global cuisines, and new cuisines continue to evolve. Cuisine can be stated as the foods and methods of food preparation traditional to a region or population. The major factors shaping a cuisine are climate, which in large measure determines the native raw materials that are available, economic conditions, which affect trade and can affect food distribution, imports and exports, and religious or sumptuary laws, under which certain foods are required or proscribed.\n\nClimate also affects the supply of fuel for cooking; a common Chinese food preparation method was cutting food into small pieces to cook foods quickly and conserve scarce firewood and charcoal. Foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking, curing, and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties even when these preserving techniques are no longer strictly necessary to the maintenance of an adequate food supply.\n\nGlobal cuisines can be categorized by regions according to the common use of major foodstuffs, such as seafood. Regional cuisines can vary according to food availability and trade, cooking traditions and cultural differences. Historically, fish and seafoods have often been staple diets near the coast or near certain rivers or lakes. From Indonesia to India to Indonesia, seafood has been used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as seasonings.\n\n\n"}

The word kalla kadal, which is used by local fishermen was adopted by UNESCO. Geographically, it refers to phenomenon when the sea water creeps in during good weather like a thief arriving unannounced. Kallakkadal event is considered as one of the major societal problems along the Indian coasts and these are caused by high swell waves, without any sign in the local winds, sometimes cause severe flooding. \n\nA recent research focused on the causes of Kallakkadal/swell surge has established the link between North Indian Ocean high swell events and the meteorological conditions in the Southern Ocean using a combination of ocean wave observations and numerical model simulations. The study confirms that Kallakkadal events are caused by swells propagating from the Southern Indian Ocean of 30°S, from the region between Africa and Australia. Swell waves are generated by distant weather systems, where wind blows for a duration of time over a large fetch.\nThe long period swell waves (>18 s) seen during Kallakkadal/Swell surge events are generated in the southern Indian ocean by severe low pressure system existed 3-5 days prior to the Kallakkadal events. The quasi-stationary nature of the southern ocean low pressure systems provides strong (~25 ms-1) and long duration (~3 days) surface winds over a large fetch; essential conditions for the generation of long period swells. The intense winds associated with these severe low pressure systems in the Southern Indian Ocean trigger the generation of high waves which propagate to Indian Coastal regions as swells. Furthermore these swells affect coastal areas which are dependent on the local topography, angle of incidence and tidal conditions, cause high wave activity and Kallakkadal along the Indian coastal regions. The study shows that Kallakkadal events along NIO coasts can be effectively monitored and forecasted at least 2 days in advance if the meteorological conditions of the Southern Ocean are properly monitored. INCOIS has been now successfully giving advanced warning to the coastal community about the Kallakkadal events.\nCharacteristics of “Kallakkadal” as follows:\n\n"}

Jodenkoeken were made famous by a baker called Davelaar, in Alkmaar, Netherlands. The Stam bakery in Alkmaar started selling jodenkoeken in 1883, and Dirk Davelaar took over this bakery in 1924. By advertising in local newspapers and by offering the cookies through other stores, his jodenkoeken became a popular product. The company continues to bake them to this day. Similar products with the same name are produced by Lotus Bakeries and O'Lacy.\n\nSome producers still use the old spelling, \"jodekoek\", while others have changed the name of the product to \"jodenkoek\", after the new orthography of the Netherlands from 1996.\n\nThere are four different stories about the name of the cookies:\n\nIn the 1970s the name was thought to be discriminatory by some, and the manufacturer considered changing it, but ultimately decided against it. The name has received little to no controversy since then, and prominent Jewish rights activist Wim Kortenoeven, while critical of the naming of the Dutch sweet \"jodenvet\" \"Jew fat\" (now \"borsthoning\" \"breast honey\"), said he saw nothing wrong with the name.

Typically, tostadas are served as a breakfast alongside (and perhaps dunked into) a hot mug of cafe con leche (strong dark-roasted Cuban coffee with scalded milk).\n\nIn the Mariana Islands, owing to their years as a Spanish colony, there is an uncommon tradition of the \"tostada de agua,\" (literally, \"toast of water\"). This dish is made of a fried tortilla topped with minced seaweed, peppers, and meat (generally chopped shrimp, though many varieties exist). Anecdotally, the entire dish was wrapped like a burrito, dunked in sea water briefly (hence the reason of its name), to add salt, offsetting the intensity of the peppers, and then unrolled and cooked until the tortilla has hardened.

The program was created by an act of the Florida Legislature and is overseen by the Florida Commission on the Status of Women (FCSW), a nonpartisan board created in 1991 to study and \"make recommendations to the Governor, Cabinet and Legislature on issues affecting women\". The FCSW also manages the Florida Achievement Award for those who have improved the lives of women and girls in Florida, an award is focused on outstanding volunteerism. FCSW members serve by appointment and the commission is housed at the Office of the Attorney General of Florida.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) in 1961, and in 1964 Florida Governor Farris Bryant created the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women (COSW) \"to study laws and regulations pertaining to women in Florida and make recommendations to the legislature based on their findings.\" \nIn 1992, Governor Lawton Chiles proposed, and the Legislature passed a bill (CSSB 1148) that created a permanent Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Chapter 92-48 of the Laws of Florida now states: \"It is the intent of the Legislature to recognize and honor those women who, through their works and lives, have made significant improvement of the life for women and for citizens of Florida.\"\n\nThis legislation mandated the inclusion of women who had been honored in the previous decade. Because education is one important purpose of the Hall of Fame, CSSB 1148 provided display space in the Florida Capitol. In 1994, the Commission unveiled plaques that offer a brief biography and photograph of each honoree.\n\nFlorida Statutes, Title XVIII Public Lands and Property, Chapter 265 Memorials, Museums and Arts and Culture, section 265.001 Florida Women's Hall of Fame, sets the parameters within which the hall of fame operates.

The governor of Florida decides on the final three nominees from a shortlist of ten nominees. The rotunda of the Florida State Capitol building has a permanent display of photos of Florida Women's Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nSince 1992, up to three women have been inducted into the Hall each year. Nominations are made between April 1 and July 15 of each year. These nominations are carefully reviewed by members of the FCSW who then propose 10 finalists to the Governor who selects the final inductees each year.\n\nSeveral other states have a Hall of Fame for notable women, including Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Ohio and Texas.

This traditional bite-size snack is commonly found in Maritime Southeast Asia, particularly in Java, Indonesia, where the cake is called \"putu bumbung\".

This green coconut-rice flour ingredients with palm sugar filling is filled into bamboo tube container. Subsequently, the filled bamboo tubes are steamed upon a steam cooker with small holes opening to blow the hot steam. The cooked tubular cakes then pushed out from the bamboo tube container, and served with grated coconut.\n\nIn Javanese, \"bumbung\" means \"bamboo\" or \"a hollow cylindrical object; a tube\". As the dish began to spread across the country, the name was later translated to Indonesian \"putu bambu\" (bambu: \"bamboo\").

But added judiciously to soups or stir-fries it provides the elusive element of deep rounded flavor that puts the \"mam\" in \"umami\".\"\n\nFood critic Mike Sula described the \"bún mắm\" in a restaurant, Nha Hang Viet Nam, in Chicago's West Argyle Street Historic District (also known as Little Vietnam): \"[I] recommend you fill your soup requirement with the \"bun mam\", a.k.a. Vietnamese gumbo, a sour seafood soup not unlike Thai tom yam that originated in the Mekong Delta.

The \"bun mam\" at BMST features tender shrimp, earthy catfish, crispy pork, steamed pork belly, and of course, vermicelli noodles. If you've never tasted \"bun mam\", the word \"fermented-fish\" might still be rolling around in your head. And what about this broth? Well, at BMST, the bun mam broth isn't nearly as pungent as, say, fish sauce. In fact, it's subtle in its complexity and delicate in its flavor.

There are two types of slátur; blóðmör (Icelandic) or \"blood pudding\" and lifrarpylsa (\"liver sausage\"). The first is similar to Irish and British black pudding and the latter similar to Scottish haggis although neither contain the spices used in British and Irish cuisine. They are also much smoother in texture.\n\nIngredients for slátur are sheep's blood, chopped or minced sheep's fat, chopped onions, oatmeal, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, thyme, pepper, salt, whole milk and sausage skins.\n\nBoth blood pudding and liver pudding are prepared in a similar fashion. Pouches are cut and sewn from the stomach, as in traditional haggis, or artificial non-edible pouches can be used. They are filled with a mixture of sliced/minced fat (\"mör\") or suet, flour (rye and oats), rolled oats and either blood or finely-minced liver (sometimes kidney is also blended in). The pouches are sewn shut after filling, then they are slow boiled for 2–3 hours. Slátur may be eaten hot or cold and sometimes it is pickled in whey.\n\nBlood pudding has been made using sheep's blood in Iceland since ancient times and similar recipes exist in many countries, using pig's blood instead. In previous centuries moss was used instead of imported flour. Liver pudding seems to have come into being at a much later stage; references to it appear during the mid-19th century.\n\nOffal is food of the autumn, prepared at the traditional slaughter time. Right up until the mid 20th century slátur was made in every home in Iceland. Many families made slatur together as a common activity. After the economic crash in autumn 2008, there appears to have been a considerable increase in slátur sales, as slátur is cheap food. Prepared and cooked offal, both blood and liver pudding, is available in stores all year round but many people consider it largely as \"þorramatur\", at the festival of \"Þorrablót\", celebrated in January and February each year. Slátur is presented alongside other savoury and sour dishes at this time of year, including \"hákarl\".\n\nBlood pudding is sometimes served with cinnamon and sugar, or sometimes with raisins. When it is served hot is usually eaten with mashed or boiled potatoes and swede/yellow turnip. It can also be cut it into slices and fried in a pan. Liver pudding is also eaten hot with potatoes.

It is a stable rice genotype that maintains its features. In 1970 it covered 8% of Italian rice-cultivated fields. Maratelli rice keeps its shape better than other forms of rice during the slow cooking required for making risotto due to higher quantities of amylose.\n\nMaratelli rice was \"born\" at Asigliano V.se (Vercelli) in the autumn of 1914 when the rice farmer Mario Maratelli saw a rice plant in the field which was different from all the other plants of the Chinese originario he was growing in that field. The plant has longer panicles, is droopier, and has a larger number of grains. The panicles are yellow, which is typical of full ripening and therefore near to harvesting. These panicles are different from the other panicles in the fields in that they have matured early whereas the others are hardly yellow and not mature.\nMaratelli picked these already mature panicles, isolated them, and packed them to preserve them with the intention of sowing these \"different\" kernels the following year. The next year he sowed the few kernels on an isolated plot of land and closely followed all the biological phases of the plants which germinate from them. He takes note of the tiller index of the mother plants and also, above all, the early ripening in comparison to the other cultivars grown. He receives confirmation of the differences he had observed the previous year and all the panicles present underlined these differences when they matured. Maratelli noted the vegetative development of the plants and compares these characteristics with those of plants from other varieties underlining certain positive aspects, these are: early maturing, better yield, better use of the land. The grains of white rice are tried in the kitchen to prepare classic dishes (such as risotto, panissa, and rice in broth) and once again the new rice finds wide approval in as much as it doesn't overcook, it combines well with other ingredients and satisfies the housewives. The new variety spreads rapidly in the Vercellese lowland and in a few years takes over from the other established varieties and imposes and maintains the record for a long time. An important step has been taken to recoup and enhance the rice \"invented\" by Mario Maratelli in 1914. From the end of April 2013, the \"original Maratelli\" has been inserted in the \"National Register of Historic Varieties\".\n\nMaratelli is an historical variety of Italian rice production, developed in 1919 through the selection of Chinese originario by Mario Maratelli from Asigliano. Maratelli is a semi-early variety (15 days earlier than Chinese originario) which shows a medium height, “semifino”, awnless pearl grain. Maratelli shows a high seedling vegetative vigor, quite a good tiller index (seven fertile stems/plant), good cold tolerance at germination stage, and medium cold tolerance at flowering stage. Stem has average height of 90–110 cm, strong and resistant to lodging. Leaf is light green colour.\n"}

It is sometimes less correctly referred to as reikäleipä, shorter term without \"ruis\" (rye) which applies also to the oat loaf with a hole.\n\nThe baking of \"ruisreikäleipä\" is a tradition in western Finland.\nIn eastern Finland thick rye bread, usually called \"ruislimppu\" (rye loaf), is more common, but traditionally only bread baked from rye has been called bread in the Karelia and Savo (eastern) regions.\n\nThe hole had a functional purpose: the bread was baked in flat rings to be placed on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling to mature and dry in the relative warmth. Usually many loaves were baked at once.\nThe poles also remained the place of storage so that the bread aged, in its many forms, over the long winter.\nNowadays this kind of bread is available in all its forms and stages of aging throughout the whole of Finland, regardless of season, and is one main component of the Finnish diet.\n\nThe way it was prepared is related to the way houses used to be built in western Finland, that is with the baking oven separate from the heating oven. In eastern Finland, where the oven used to be heated every day, it was more common to eat freshly baked bread and to cook various kinds of long-stewed oven foods like the Karelian hot pot.\n\nUnlike \"ruislimppu\", there is no discernible difference between the skin and the core of \"ruisreikäleipä\", as the dark outer color and the soft inner core are missing. Considerably more roughage is present, and the bread is rather dense compared to the other traditional breads. Some flour, seed and even yeast remnants can top the bread; less moisture is present; and the texture is somewhere between gummy, unyielding and downright crackery, depending on age. This reflects the bread's role as an indefinitely storable foodstuff which would last from the fertile summer through the relatively long and harsh northern winter.\n\nAs a result, \"ruisreikäleipä\" takes some time and effort to chew down properly. In the process it then acquires a peculiar culinary quality: it starts off as rather sour and earthy in taste, but by the time it is ready to be swallowed, amylase enzymes in the saliva have already broken down enough of the starch in it to make it sweeter.\n\n\n"}

The original version included celery, garlic, parsley, and possibly mashed potatoes as well.\n\nAccording to the Senate website, \"Bean soup is on the menu in the Senate's restaurant every day. There are several stories about the origin of that mandate, but none has been corroborated.\"\n\nOn September 14, 1943, rationing due to World War II left the Senate kitchen without enough navy beans to serve the soup. The \"Washington Times-Herald\" reported on its absence the following day. In a speech on the Senate floor in 1988, Bob Dole recounted the response to the crisis: \"Somehow, by the next day, more beans were found and bowls of bean soup have been ladled up without interruption ever since.\"\n\nA 1967 memo from the Architect of the Capitol to the Librarian of the Senate describes the modern recipe, calling for \"two pounds of small Michigan Navy Beans\".\n\nJohn Egerton writes in \"Southern Food\" that the use of ham hocks suggests an origin in Southern cuisine. Although the legislators credited with institutionalizing the soup did not represent Southern states, most of the cooks at the time were black Southerners who would prepare bean soup in their own style. There was a period when the Senate dining services omitted the ham and instead used a soup base. In 1984, a new manager discovered this practice; he reflects, \"we went back to the ham hocks, and there was a real difference.\" \n\nSouthern tradition also calls for cooking beans a very long time, usually over 10 hours or overnight so that the soup creates its own rich, thick gravy and has a much better flavor and texture than simply cooking three hours. Southern cooks would not have needed to add potatoes as a thickener, in fact if cooked in a traditional southern style, mashed potatoes would have altered the texture unfavorably and made it more bland in flavor. Also, the use of meat with bone still in it is traditional for flavor and texture for the overnight method. Southern cooks would also have added a little seasoning to cut the starchiness. The seasoning being in new England would likely have been a bay leaf or very small amount of oregano but not enough to be detected.\nCooking over 10 hours requires adding more broth or water every so often. Today, southern cooks have the luxury of slow cookers and crockpots to cook beans overnight, but back in the early twentieth century, the beans would have soaked overnight in a large pot and cooked all day mostly without much fuss allowing kitchen staff to tend to other dishes and duties in the kitchen.\n\nThere are two Senate soup recipes:\n\nAccording to \"The Best Soups in the World\", \"most reports ... suggest that it unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired.\"\nMore than likely, that review is referring to the more bland version that uses mashed potatoes.\n\nAs of 2010, members of the public can try the soup between 11:30am and 3pm in the Senate dining room. There is a dress code, and entry requires a \"request letter\" from a senator. The soup is also available to the general public at the Capitol Visitor Center restaurant on a rotating basis, between 7:30am and 4pm, and in the Longworth Cafeteria, between 7:30am and 2:30pm.\n\nThe Project Greek Island bunker, a Cold War-era emergency relocation center for Congress, included a cafeteria that would have served Senate bean soup.\n\nPast prices for a bowl include:\n\n\n\n"}

The company sells a range of chocolate bars and vanilla products, all sourced from the island of Madagascar. All of the cocoa is certified Direct Trade and is sourced directly from Malagasy cocoa farmers. For several years, Madécasse worked with a local chocolate producer based in Antananarivo, and is currently producing chocolate in Europe while working to move production back to Madagascar.\n\nFounders Brett Beach and Tim McCollum met while serving as Peace Corps volunteers in Madagascar. After spending a combined eight years on the island, McCollum and Beach felt that they wanted to have more of an impact and that “business was needed for real (social and environmental) change.” Cocoa had always been a major export of Madagascar but very little chocolate had been produced on the island, much like in the rest of Africa. Even though the continent grows over 65% of the world's cocoa, less than 1% of the world’s chocolate is made there. The two were determined to have a significant impact on the island they had come to love, and formulated an innovative business model for a chocolate business. They would produce chocolate on the island, and the majority of the economic benefit would stay within the country. The two reunited back in the United States and started the company at Beach’s residence in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nMadécasse partnered with the cocoa farmers of the Ezaka Cooperative, from a remote area of Madagascar. The company initially had trouble meeting the quality standards of the United States, as the cocoa beans needed more fermentation and drying. McCollum said, “You have farmers farming cocoa who have never eaten chocolate.” Madécasse trained the farmers, invested in equipment, and developed a bonus program for the cooperative. Since the company established a consistent process for producing high quality cocoa, it has achieved critical acclaim for its chocolates. Madécasse partnered with a factory on the island that has steadily increased their production outcome, according to Malagasy-born Michaël Chauveau, director of operations in Madagascar. As Madécasse expanded, it ventured out and partnered with more farming cooperatives in order to meet demand.\n\nThere was room for growth in other markets besides chocolate, as Madagascar provided 60% of the world’s vanilla beans. Madécasse exports vanilla beans and extract from Madagascar to replicate the effect that they have with their chocolate bars in the vanilla sector. Now, Madécasse has offices in Brooklyn, managed by McCollum, and Madagascar.\n\n\nThe company has achieved recognition for its innovative business model, local impact, and the chocolate itself.\nMadécasse has been named:\n\n"}

She has twice been awarded the annual Sophie Coe Prize in Food History at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, most recently in 2006. In 2008 she won the Prix du Champagne Lanson for her wine journalism on \"Slow Food Magazin\".\n\nIn English she has written a book-length survey of German food, \"Food Culture in Germany\", published by Greenwood Press in 2008. In Germany, however, she is best known for her series of three books on real and traditional food, beginning with \"Erlebnis Essen\" (2006). This includes a comparative tasting of top quality French and German butter in which the renowned \"appellation d'origine protégée\" butter of Isigny-Sainte-Mère met strong competition. The series continues with \"Erlebnis Kochen\" (subtitled \"Manifesto for a cuisine without recipes\": 2007). The third volume, \"Erlebnis Käse und Wein\" (2009), takes the form of a \"voyage of discovery\", an exploration of German cheese, German wine and how well the two go together. She took up the same theme in illustrated articles for the popular magazine \"Für Sie\", \"Cheese and Wine from Germany\" and \"Cheese and Wine Ideas\".\n\nAs a journalist she has written in English for \"Saveur\" and in German for \"Slow Food Magazin\" and \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". Her recipes from the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\" were collected in book form in 2010.

It is designed by the company Adidas, a FIFA Partner and FIFA World Cup official match ball supplier since 1970.\n\nThe name of the ball was revealed on 2 September 2012. It was selected by a public vote organised by the Local Organising Committee and Adidas, with over one million Brazilian football fans voting. The name \"Brazuca\" was chosen with 77.8% of the vote. Two other voting options were given: \"Bossa Nova\" (14.6% of the vote) and \"Carnavalesca\" (7.6% of the vote).\n\nAccording to FIFA, \"the informal term 'brazuca' (our fellow) is used by Brazilians to describe national pride in the Brazilian way of life\", and \"mirroring their approach to football, it symbolises emotion, pride and goodwill to all\". The term is also used as slang for \"Brazilian\" and became well-known abroad due to the Brazilian diaspora.\n\nThe ball is a developmental successor to the Adidas Tango 12 series of balls, with the same bladder and carcass but a different surface structure. The ball weighs 437 grams and has a circumference of 69 centimetres. The ball has been made of six polyurethane panels which have been thermally bonded; the reduction in the number of panels is claimed to increase the consistency in the ball. The Brazuca ball has been stated to avoid aerodynamic problems with the Jabulani ball used in South Africa for the previous World Cup. It is textured to feel more like the Adidas Finale 13, the official UEFA Champions League ball, than the Jabulani.\n\nThe ball has a multi-colour design referenced from the traditional wish bracelet to represent Brazil. The colours used in the match balls are blue, green, red, white and black.\n\nThe match ball for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, announced on 29 May 2014, featured a variation of the Adidas Brazuca named the \"Adidas Brazuca Final Rio\". Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Brazuca balls used in the group stages and other playoffs, with a green, gold and black colouring. It is the third special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin (2006) and the Jabulani (2010).\n\nThe Brazuca went through an extensive testing process before its use at the World Cup. Adidas had been developing the ball for over 2 years, and had worked with many teams and players to ensure the ball was acceptable. The ball has appeared in the FIFA U-20 World Cup, DFB-Pokal final as well as disguised as the Adidas Cafusa in international friendly matches. Each team participating in the World Cup finals were delivered a set of Brazuca balls after the unveiling in December 2013 to have sufficient time to practice with it.\n\nThe original Brazuca balls for the World Cup finals were contract manufactured in Pakistan, however bono fide replica balls are made in both China and Pakistan.\n\nTaipei-based Long Way Enterprise were originally asked to manufacture the ball in their subsidiary YaYork Plastic Products in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China. The company has been associated with production of Adidas balls since 1997.\n\nLong Way, however, was unable to meet the high demand for the ball. A second supplier, Forward Sports (based in Sialkot, Pakistan), was brought in to help manufacture the ball. Forward Sports, who have been associated with Adidas since 1995 and already supplied footballs for both the UEFA Champions League and the German Bundesliga, were awarded the contract by Adidas at short notice after the original manufacturer in China failed to meet the demand . Over 42 million Brazuca balls were exported from Sialkot.

However, a similar system had been in use for sports competitions in the United States as early as 1884. \n\nBergvall wanted to improve on the traditional knockout method used in Olympic competitions: believing that this was only fair in deciding the gold medal winner, Bergvall advocated separate competitions should also be held for the silver and bronze medals. \n\nBergvall also believed that teams knocked out in the early rounds of the main gold medal tournament should be given a second chance, and that all the teams knocked out by the gold medal winner, including the losing finalist, should then compete in another knockout competition for the silver medal, before all the teams that were knocked out by the gold and silver medallists compete in a third competition for the bronze. \n\nAt the 1912, 1920 and 1924 Games, the Bergvall system was used to decide the water polo, while at the 1920 Games it was also used for the football, the ice hockey and the tug of war.\n\nAlthough the system is fair, there are two main flaws:\n\nBecause of these flaws, the system was dropped by Olympic organisers after 1924 and was abandoned by the NCAA in the 1930s.\n"}

It is made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific amount of water, milk and sugar and then cooking while stirring regularly. It is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios. The nuts and other items used are first sautéed in ghee, type of clarified butter from the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe dessert is traditionally eaten during all of the festivals in India, mainly on the occasion of Diwali, Holi, Eid al-Fitr and Raksha Bandhan. It is served hot during the winter.\n\nGajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrot. It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweet from the Indian subcontinent. Gajar halwa has a medium shelf life so it is now sometimes exported.\n\nAt festival time many people prefer vegetarian dishes as well as desserts in their Thali. Because of its low fat content, vegetarian characteristics, ease of making, medium shelf-life and taste Gajar ka halwa is a popular dessert all over India and often served at most festivals. The dish is popular among adults as well as children. In 300 grams of gajar halwa there are 268 calories (76 come from fat, 180 from carbohydrate and 16 from protein).\n\nThe gajar ka halwa was first introduced during the Mughal period and the name originates from the Arabic word \"halwa\", which means \"sweet\" and it is made from carrot (in Hindi: \"gajar\") so that it is known as gajar ka halwa (meaning pudding of carrot or Halwa of carrot). It is strongly associated with Punjab but it is not clear whether it originated there. It is very similar to the other types of Punjabi halwa. Gajar ka halwa originally contained carrots, milk and ghee but nowadays includes many other ingredients like mava (khoya). This age old traditional recipe remained in Punjabi cookbooks for many years. Being a combination of milk and carrots it is known as \"milk flavored gajar ka halwa\" but in the other case, the combination of cream or mava (khoya) and carrot is described as \"mava flavored gajar ka halwa\".\n\nThe main ingredients of gajar ka halwa are freshly grated carrots, milk, sugar, khoya, and ghee. The quantity and quality may vary according to personal taste. In the sugar free variant, sugar is excluded from the recipe. For cooking gajar ka halwa, a cooker or kadai is usually preferred. Vasundhara Chauhan, writing for The Hindu, writes that gajar ka halwa should be slow-cooked and that using a pressure cooker spoils the dish. Carrots must first be grated and then dried before cooking. The grated carrots are then put into a heated pan with a specific amount of milk or khoya and sugar. After stirring for 4–5 minutes, roughly chopped cashew nuts are added and 10–15 minutes later a specific amount of pure ghee is added as well. Finally, it is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios.\n\nIn the \"carrot-papaya halwa\", equal amounts of carrot and papaya are used. First, a mixture of carrot and papaya scrapings is prepared. This mixture is fried in a kadai or a cooker with ghee for about 5 minutes. The rest of the process is same as the basic recipe. This recipe has become popular lately because papaya is added to it which provides a different flavor and taste compared to the regular gajar ka halwa. \"Red velvet carrot halwa\" is another famous variation of the gajar ka halwa. It is made by heating a comparatively large amount of milk cream along with carrots, sugar, rose water and saffron over low flame. Red velvet carrot halwa is also a very good source of Vitamin A and Calcium.\n\nOther lesser-known variations include \"Carrot and beetroot halwa\", \"cheese gajar ka halwa\", \"khajur gajar ka halwa\" and carrot dessert. These variations vary in popularity by regional/personal preferences, with the traditional gajar ka halwa being most popular. In the \"carrot and beetroot halwa\", grated beetroot is added to grated carrots and this mixture is heated in a kadai on a low flame and further a specific amount of mava and sugar per choice is added to it. After 30 minutes of stirring and cooking, carrot and beetroot halwa is ready to be served. \"Cheese gajar ka halwa\" is prepared with a combination of \"purple carrots\" and ricotta. This dish is popular in northern India because purple carrots are mostly grown there.\n\nThere is a one variation use coconut milk as a replacement for milk in the preparation of Gajar ka Halwa. The healthy gajar ka halwa can be made with jaggery also.\n"}
