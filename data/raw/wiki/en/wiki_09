As a consequence, much of the work done in the name of this approach has examined the connection between changes in psychology and personhood, on the one hand, and changes in macro social structures on the other. \n\nNorbert Elias is usually acknowledged as an early or primary practitioner, as a consequence of his ground-breaking 1939 work, \"The Civilizing Process\".\n\n"}
{"id": "839045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839045", "title": "Phronesis", "text": "Phronesis\n\nPhronesis () is an Ancient Greek word for a type of wisdom or intelligence. It is more specifically a type of wisdom relevant to practical action, implying both good judgement and excellence of character and habits, or practical virtue. Phronesis was a common topic of discussion in ancient Greek philosophy. \n\nThe word was used in Greek philosophy, and such discussions are still influential today. In Aristotelian ethics, for example in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", it is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual virtues – such as \"episteme\" and \"techne\". Because of its practical character, when it is not simply translated by words meaning wisdom or intelligence, it is often translated as \"practical wisdom\", and sometimes (more traditionally) as \"prudence\", from Latin . Thomas McEvilley has proposed that the best translation is \"mindfulness\".\n\nIn some of his dialogues, Plato showed his teacher Socrates proposing that having \"phronēsis\" is the same as being a virtuous person. By thinking with \"phronēsis\", a person has virtue. Therefore, all virtuousness is a form of phronēsis. In the mind of Socrates \"phronēsis\" equals virtue, they are the same thing. Being good, is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts. \"Phronēsis\" allows a person to have moral or ethical strength.\n\nIn Plato's Meno, Socrates explains how \"phronēsis\", a quality synonymous with \"moral understanding\", is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self.\n\nIn the 6th book of his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Plato's student and friend Aristotle famously distinguished between two intellectual virtues: \"sophia\" (wisdom) and \"phronesis\", and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues. \"Sophia\" is a combination of nous, the ability to discern reality, and \"epistēmē\", a type of knowledge which is logically built up and teachable, and which is sometimes equated with science. This involves reasoning concerning universal truths. \"Phronesis\" involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end, but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of living well overall.\n\nAristotle points out that although \"sophia\" is higher and more serious than \"phronesis\", the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because \"phronesis\" facilitates \"sophia\". He also associates \"phronesis\" with political ability.\n\nAccording to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric, \"phronesis\" is one of the three types of appeal to character (\"ethos\"). The other two are respectively appeals to \"arete\" (virtue) and \"eunoia\" (goodwill).\n\nGaining \"phronesis\" requires experience, according to Aristotle who wrote that:...although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge [\"sophoi\"], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [\"phronimos\"]. The reason is that Prudence [\"phronesis\"] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the fruit of years.\n\n\"Phronesis\" is concerned with particulars, because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations. One can learn the principles of action, but applying them in the real world, in situations one could not have foreseen, requires experience of the world. For example, if one knows that one should be honest, one might act in certain situations in ways that cause pain and offense; knowing how to apply honesty in balance with other considerations and in specific contexts requires experience.\n\nAristotle holds that having \"phronesis\" is both necessary and sufficient for being virtuous; because \"phronesis\" is practical, it is impossible to be both \"phronetic\" and akratic; i.e., prudent persons cannot act against their \"better judgement.\"\n\nIn light of his fundamental ontology, Martin Heidegger interprets Aristotle in such a way that \"phronesis\" (and practical philosophy as such) is the original form of knowledge and thus primary to \"sophia\" (and theoretical philosophy).\n\nHeidegger interprets the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" as an ontology of Human Existence. The practical philosophy of Aristotle is a guiding thread in his Analysis of Existence according to which facticity names our unique mode of being in the world. Through his ‘existential analytic’, Heidegger recognises that ‘Aristotelian phenomenology’ suggests three fundamental movements of life including \"póiesis\", \"práxis\", \"theoría\" and that these have three corresponding dispositions: \"téchne\", \"phrónesis\" and \"sophía\". Heidegger considers these as modalities of Being inherent in the structure of \"‘Dasein’\" as being-in-the-world that is situated within the context of concern and care. According to Heidegger phronesis in Aristotle’s work discloses the right and proper way to be \"Dasein\". Heidegger sees phronesis as a mode of comportment in and toward the world, a way of orienting oneself and thus of caring-seeing-knowing and enabling a particular way of being concerned. \n\nWhile \"techne\" is a way of being concerned with things and principles of production and theoria a way of being concerned with eternal principles, phronesis is a way of being concerned with one’s life (qua action) and with the lives of others and all particular circumstances as purview of praxis. Phronesis is a disposition or habit, which reveals the being of the action while deliberation is the mode of bringing about the disclosive appropriation of that action. In other words, deliberation is the way in which the phronetic nature of \"Dasein’s\" insight is made manifest. \n\nPhronesis is a form of circumspection, connected to conscience and resoluteness respectively being-resolved in action of human existence (\"Dasein\") as \"práxis\". As such it discloses the concrete possibilities of being in a situation, as the starting point of meaningful action, processed with resolution, while facing the contingencies of life.\nHowever Heidegger’s ontologisation has been criticised as closing \"práxis\" within a horizon of solipsistic decision that deforms its political sense that is its practico-political configuration (Volpi, 2007).\nIn \"After Virtue\", Alasdair MacIntyre called for a phronetic social science. He points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually counter-examples. Hence the unpredictability of human beings and human life requires a focus on practical experiences.\n\n\n"}

The company is headquartered in New York City, and is privately held. Despite the title, it is not associated with Princeton University.\n\nThe Princeton Review was founded in 1981 by John Katzman, who—shortly after leaving college—taught SAT preparation to 15 students in New York City. He served as CEO until 2007, and was replaced by Michael Perik. In March 2010, Perik resigned and was replaced by John M. Connolly. In April 2010, the company sold $48 million in stock for $3 per share, and a short time later was accused of fraud in a class action suit filed by a Michigan retirement fund, which claimed The Princeton Review leadership exaggerated earnings to boost its stock price. In 2012, the company was acquired by Charlesbank Capital, a private equity fund, for $33 million. On August 1, 2014, the Princeton Review brand name and operations were bought for an undisclosed sum by Tutor.com, an IAC company, and Mandy Ginsburg became CEO.

Princeton Review officials counter that their rankings are unique in that they rely on student opinion and not just on statistical data.\n\nIn 2002 an American Medical Association affiliated program, A Matter of Degree, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, criticized the Princeton Review list of Best Party Schools. \"USA Today\" published an editorial titled \"Sobering Statistics\" in August 2002 and stated, \"the doctor's group goes too far in suggesting that the rankings contribute to the problem (of campus drinking).\" The editorial noted the fact that among the schools the AMA program was then funding as part of its campaign against campus drinking, six of 10 of those schools calling for The Princeton Review to \"drop the annual ranking...had made (Princeton Review's) past top-party-school lists: many times for some. That's no coincidence.\" The editorial commended The Princeton Review for reporting the list, calling it \"a public service\" for \"student applicants and their parents\".\n\nRankings for LGBT-related lists have also been criticized as inaccurate due to outdated methodologies. The Princeton Review bases its LGBT-Friendly and LGBT-Unfriendly top twenty ranking lists, which asks undergraduates: \"Do students, faculty, and administrators at your college treat all persons equally regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identify/expression?\" The Princeton Review also publishes \"The Gay & Lesbian Guide to College Life\".\n\nIn 2016, the company was criticized by privacy rights advocates who worry that a company that owns online dating and college preparation services could amass data and exploit it in a way that preys on unsuspecting consumers, particularly younger people. \"Do parents know that when their underage kids enroll for exam prep or tutoring, personal information may be shared with hookup sites that could then target their kids to become customers?\" asked one critic, who concluded that the company \"makes no guarantee that data sharing among its entities will not include those customers whose sole aim is to improve their grades and test scores.\" Indeed, another critic points out that The Princeton Review \"policy states 'we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit our site'—information like data 'regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests.'

Common additions include ground meat from pork, poultry, fish or beef, fat, vegetables, herbs, spices, and either wine or brandy (often cognac or armagnac). Pâté can be served either hot or cold, but it is considered to develop its fullest flavor after a few days of chilling.\n\nIn French or Belgian cuisine, \"pâté\" may be baked in a crust as pie or loaf, in which case it is called \"pâté en croûte\", or baked in a terrine (or other mold), in which case it is known as \"pâté en terrine\". Traditionally, a forcemeat mixture cooked and served in a terrine is also called a terrine. The most famous pâté is probably \"pâté de foie gras\", made from the livers of fattened geese. \"Pâté en croûte\" is baked with the insertion of \"chimneys\" on top: small tubes or funnels that allow steam to escape, thus keeping the pastry crust from turning damp or soggy. Baked \"pâté en croûte\" usually develops an air bubble under the crust top as the meat mixture shrinks during baking; this is traditionally dealt with by infusing semi-liquid aspic in the hollow space before chilling.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark and Austria, some liver pâtés are shaped as a soft, often spreadable sausage, called \"leverworst\" (Dutch), \"pate\" or \"lebăr\" (Romanian), \"májpástétom/májkrém\" (Hungarian), or \"Leberwurst\" (German). In the United States these are sometimes called \"liverwurst\" (mixing English and German), or \"braunschweiger\". Some liverwursts can be sliced. In the US, sliced liverwurst is used as a sandwich filler. Others are spreadable as are most French or Belgian \"pâté\"; these types are more popular in the United Kingdom. In Scandinavia, \"leverpostej\" (in the Netherlands: \"leverpastei\") is a popular baked \"pâté\" similar to the French \"pâté en terrine\", usually made of lard and pork liver.\n\nIn Poland, \"pasztet\" is made from poultry, fish, venison, ham, or pork with eggs, flour, bread crumbs, and a varied range of additions, such as pepper, tomato sauce, mushrooms, spices, vegetables, ginger, nutmeg, cheese, or sugar.\n\nIn Russia and Ukraine, the dish is mostly prepared with beef, goose or chicken liver and thus is commonly known as \"pechyonochniy pashtet\" (, \"liver pâté\"), however other meats also can be used. Unlike the Western European method the liver is first cooked (boiled or fried) and mixed with butter or fat and seasoning such as fresh or fried onion, carrots, spices and herbs. It can be further cooked (usually baked), but most often is used without any other preparation. In Russia, the pâté is served on a plate or in a bowl, and is often molded into the shapes of animals, such as hedgehogs. A similar recipe is known as chopped liver in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, where schmaltz is used instead of butter and hard-boiled eggs are usually added. Another common type of pâté in Jewish cuisine, also popular in Russia and Ukraine, is \"vorschmack\" or \"gehakte herring\" (chopped herring).\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, \"pašteta\" or \"паштета\" (a thinly pureed pâté) is a very popular bread spread usually made from chicken, beef, turkey or less commonly tuna or salmon.\n\nIn Vietnam, pâté (\"gan xay\") is commonly used on \"bánh mì\" \"baguette\" type sandwiches. Pâté of this type is more commonly made from liver.\n"}

It was founded as a grocery by Émile A. Zatarain, in 1886. He created a formulation for root beer that became popular regionally after its introduction at 2:30 p.m. on May 7, 1889, at the Louisiana (Purchase) Exposition under the brand Papoose Root Beer, for which he took out a trademark. He started a new business, Papoose Pure Food Products, built a factory, and began to market it in 1889.\n\nHe expanded his product range to include mustard, pickled vegetables, and extracts. Then he moved into the spice business and became known for New Orleans and Cajun-style products. In 1963 the family sold the business, which has been owned in several different forms in its more than 130-year history. The brand is currently owned by McCormick, the world's largest spice company.\n\nThe company produces Cajun and Creole cuisine related food items, in five categories:\nThe company still manufactures root beer extract for home preparation and brewing.\n\nZatarain's was founded by Emile A. Zatarain, Sr. a merchant and entrepreneur of Basque descent. He had 5 sons, all of whom followed him into his business when they finished school.\n\nIn 1886, Zatarain opened a grocery store with the first National Cash Register in Louisiana. A few months later, he bought a horse and buggy to do deliveries. The company's big success, at first, was root beer. According to great granddaughter Allison Zatarain, \"Emile introduced Papoose Root Beer at 2:30 p.m. on May 7, 1889, at the Louisiana (Purchase) Exposition. The root beer was so successful, that his business grew, and grew, and grew!\"\n\nSeveral years later, Zatarain found that it was more cost effective to sell the root beer blend as an extract. Zatarain formed a company called Papoose Pure Food Products to manufacture the root beer and diversify into other foods and he built a factory at 925 Valmont Street, New Orleans. He began to import and pack olives, pickles and spices.\n\nWhen the root beer and spice business became more profitable than the grocery store, Zatarain focused on the manufacturing business at Papoose Pure Food Products. His root beer extract sold in barrels to restaurants and markets where it was added to carbonated water.\n\nSeasonings with a Creole or Cajun flair were among the first of Papoose Pure's products expansions. Next they moved into Creole Mustard and pickled products.\n\nOn May 29, 1922, as his sons assumed more of the day-to-day operation, Zatarain reincorporated the business as \"'E.A. Zatarain & Sons, Inc.and also did business as Zatarain's Pure Food Products'.\" Emile A. Zatarain, Jr. and his wife Ida May Bennett Zatarain eventually took over the business. Ida May created recipes for their products like Remoulade Sauce and Olive Salad.\n\nIn 1963 the family sold the business to James Grinstead Viavant, founder of the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, who had sold his ship building business in 1959. Viavant took over the company, which was using outdated, inefficient packaging technology and modernized it.\n\nIn 1963, Viavant merged Zatarain's Pa-Poose Products Co., Inc. and another recently acquired business, Pelican State Lab, owner a brand of coated fish frying seasoning mix called Fish-Fri, which was brought under the Zatarain's label, and became a best-seller. He dropped bleach, dyes, and pickles and focused on the profit centers at a new plant with modern equipment on a five-acre campus in Gretna, Louisiana, where he turned Zatarain's into a regionally well known brand by the early 1970s. Fish-Fri became \"the entreè\" of litigation in 1983. Zatarain's sued Oak Grove Smokehouse for trademark infringement; Oak Grove sold a competitor \"Fish Fry.\" Although the court determined Fish-Fri qualified for protection, Oak Grove's Fish Fry qualified as a fair use. The case opinion is also notable for its use of puns.\n\nWith rising sales of $10M a year, as Viavant neared retirement, he sold the business to Centra Soya Co. for $24 million in May 1984. Centra increased sales revenues to $14M when it sold Zatarain's to a San Francisco holding company, Wyndham Foods, Inc., 18 months later. Wyndham kept the retail business, and expanded Zatarain's brand into the institutional food business. They rolled out the boxed food products that Zatarains still manufactures, using the term \"Cajun\" on the boxes to capitalize on the trend in cooking popularized by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s. When the fad faded, the company shifted to branding Zatarain's products as \"Louisiana-style\" or \"New Orleans-style\"\n\nThe company was acquired again in 1987 by a Brentwood, Tennessee company, Martha White Foods, which itself was a subsidiary of E-II Food Specialties Co. for $35 million. Zatarain's had several more owners over a period of months in the late 1980s, including American Brands of Old Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nBy the 1990s, Zatarain's sold more than 200 products locally and regionally. They pushed to gain a national footing by the end of the decade with the first national television advertising in 1999.\n\nThe company was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Citigroup Venture Capital in 1993 as Zatarain's Partnership LP, a partner group of Citigroup Venture Capital and several Zatarain's employees. The product line was expanded to include frozen foods. It was sold to McCormick on May 9, 1993 for $180M after the company's sales rose 15% annually for the prior five years.\n\nIn 2017, the New Orleans Pelicans announced Zatarain's as their jersey patch sponsor.\n\n\n"}

The term “bibim” means mixing various ingredients, while the “bap” noun refers to rice. \"Bibimbap\" is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with \"namul\" (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) and \"gochujang\" (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or \"doenjang\" (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish is stirred together thoroughly just before eating.\n\nIn South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap. In 2011, the dish was listed at number 40 on the \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.\n\nThe exact origin of bibimbap (비빔밥) is unknown. People could have started mixing bap (rice) with banchan (side dishes) after the outdoor \"jesa\" (rites), such as \"sansinje\" (rite for mountain god) or \"dongsinje\" (rite for village god), where they needed to \"eat with the god\" but did not have as many cooking pots and items of crockery to hand as they would normally have at home. Some scholars assert that bibimbap originates from the traditional practice of mixing all the food offerings made at an \"jesa\" (ancestral rite) in a bowl before partaking of it.\n\nOrdinary people ate bibimbap on the eve of the lunar new year as the people at that time felt that they had to get rid of all of the leftover side dishes before the new year. The solution to this problem was to put all of the leftovers in a bowl of rice and to mix them together. Farmers ate bibimbap during farming season as it was the easiest way to make food for a large number of people. Bibimbap served to the king usually as a lunch or a between-meal snack. The proportion of meat was more than vegetable in bibimbap. \n\nBibimbap was recorded as \"hondon-ban\" () in the history book \"Historical notes of Gijae\" by the Joseon scholar Bak Dong-ryang (1569–1635). In the \"Diary of Cheongdae\" by another Joseon scholar Gwon Sang-il (1679–1760), it was recorded as \"goldong-ban\" (). The dish was also recorded in \"Complete Works of Seongho\" by Yi Ik (1681–1764) as \"goldong\" (), in \"Complete Works of Cheongjanggwan\" by Yi deok-mu (1741–1793) as \"goldong-ban\" (), and in \"Works of Nakhasaeng\" by Yi Hak-gyu (1770–1835) as both \"goldong-ban\" () and \"goldong\" ().\n\nThe hangul transcription \"beubwieum\" () first appears in the 1810 encyclopaedia \"Mongyupyeon\" by Jang Hon. The 1870 encyclopaedia \"Myeongmul giryak\" states that the dish name is written as \"goldong-ban\" () in hanja but is read as \"bubaeban\" (), a probable transcription of the native Korean \"bubim-bap\" ().\n\nIn \"Collected Works of Oju\" written by Yi Gyu-gyeong (1788–1856), recorded varieties of bibimbap, such as vegetable bibimbap, miscellany bibimbap, hoe bibimbap, shad bibimbap, prawn bibimbap, salted srhimp bibimbap, shrimp roe bibimbap, marinated crab bibimbap, wild chive bibimbap, fresh cucumber bibimbap, gim flake bibimbap, gochujang bibimbap, soybean sprout bibimbap, and also stated that bibimbap was a local specialty of Pyongyang, along with naengmyeon and gamhongno.\n\nRecipe for \"bibimbap\" is first mentioned in the \"Siuijeonseo\", an anonymous cookbook from the late 19th century.\n\nIn the late 20th century, \"bibimbap\" started to become widespread in different countries, due to its convenience of preparation. Many airlines that connecting to South Korea served it. The globe accepted it as a popular Korean dish. It also symbolized the frequent migration of foreigners which lead to multiculturalism of Korea.\n\nVegetables commonly used in \"bibimbap\" include julienned \"oi\" (cucumber), aehobak (courgette), \"mu\" (radish), mushrooms, \"doraji\" (bellflower root), and \"gim\", as well as spinach, soybean sprouts, and \"gosari\" (bracken fern stems). \"Dubu\" (tofu), either plain or sautéed, or a leaf of lettuce may be added, or chicken or seafood may be substituted for beef. For visual appeal, the vegetables are often placed so adjacent colors complement each other. In the South Korean version, sesame oil, red pepper paste (gochujang), and sesame seeds are added.the Bibimbap meal includes meat, rice, sesame oil, vegetables, as well as gochujang which are presented as a single dish and eaten with chopsticks and spoons. The meal provides unique nutrition and flavor fused with attractive colors due to its rich ingredients. Furthermore, the ingredients have low calorie content, hence offer a healthy diet. The combination of vegetables, rice, fermented sauces and meat provides adequate fiber, carbohydrates and protein content. By harmonizing together various ingredients, bibimbap emerges as a unique meal that symbolizes the harmony and balance in the Korean culture.\n\n\nBibimbap ingredients are rich in symbolism. Black or dark colours represent North and the kidneys – for instance, shiitake mushrooms, bracken ferns or nori seaweed. Red or orange represents South and the heart, with chilli, carrots, and jujube dates. Green represents East and the liver, with cucumber and spinach. White is West or the lungs, with foods such as bean sprouts, radish, and rice. And finally yellow represents the centre, or stomach. Foods include pumpkin, potato or egg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "843843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=843843", "title": "Cambodian cuisine", "text": "Cambodian cuisine\n\nKhmer cuisine () or, more generally, Cambodian cuisine, is the traditional cuisine of the people of Cambodia. Average meals typically consist of more than one dish and ideally contrast flavours, textures and temperatures within the meal using plenty of herbs, leaves, pickled vegetables, dipping sauces, edible flowers and other garnishes and condiments.\n\nRice is the staple food in Cambodia, and it is part of every meal, both as an accompaniment and used as an ingredient for many dishes. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia that were developed over centuries by Cambodian rice farmers.\n\nRice is eaten throughout the day in the form of street-side snacks, such as deep-fried rice cakes with chives and spinach, for breakfast, as in Cambodia's famous rice noodle soup kuyteav or rice porridge, and in many desserts. Plain white rice is served with nearly every family meal, typically served with grilled freshwater fish, a \"samlor\" or soup, and an assortment of seasonal herbs, salad leaves and vegetables.\n\nWater, rice and freshwater fish exert the most profound influences on Khmer cuisine. The Mekong river, the twelfth longest in the world, cuts through the very heart of Cambodia. The capital Phnom Penh is on its riverbank, at the junction where two other rivers meet: the Tonle Sap and Bassac. The Tonle Sap river connects the Mekong with the Tonle Sap lake, or Great Lake, which acts as a liquid heart and natural reservoir for the entire Mekong river system, regulating the flow of huge volumes of water, and allowing the safe passage of an astonishing number of freshwater fish. The lake itself is believed to have more fish than any other in the world and ranks second to the Amazon river in biodiversity.\n\nWhen the rainy season begins at the start of the Khmer New Year, the region becomes inundated with monsoonal rain and Cambodia turns into a vast ocean of emerald rice-paddies. The geographical setting of wetlands (Cambodia ranks second to Bangladesh for the largest amount of wetland in Asia) and floodplains explains why water, and hence fish and rice (which grow in water) are such an integral component to the cuisine. Many dishes, in particular, the \"samlors\", have a pond-like appearance, and are often loaded with reed-like plants, leaves, and vegetables, mirroring the surrounding landscape. Dipping sauces tend to be quite watery, as are most Cambodian curries.\n\nKhmer cuisine shares many commonalities with the food of neighbouring Thailand—although, less chilli, sugar and coconut cream are used for flavor—and of neighboring Vietnam, with which it shares and adopts many common dishes, as well as a colonial history, as both formed part of the French colonial empire in Southeast Asia. It has drawn upon influences from the cuisines of China and France, powerful players in Cambodian history. The Chinese began arriving in the 13th century, but Chinese migration accelerated during the French period. Curry dishes, known as \"Kari\" (in Khmer, ) show a trace of cultural influence from India. The many variations of rice noodles show the influences from Chinese cuisine. Preserved lemons are another unusual ingredient not commonly found in the cooking of Cambodia's neighbors; it is used in some Khmer dishes to enhance the sourness. The Portuguese and Spanish also had considerable influence in Cambodian affairs in the 16th century, introducing chili and peanuts into Asia from the New World. However, chili never gained the same status or prominence as it did with the cuisines of neighboring Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. Even today very few recipes include chili.\n\nOne legacy of French, the baguette—known as \"nom pang\" in Khmer—is ubiquitous in all parts of Cambodia today. Cambodians often eat bread with pâté, tinned sardines or eggs. One of these with a cup of strong coffee, sweetened with condensed milk, is an example of a common Cambodian breakfast. Freshly buttered baguettes can be made into sandwiches (also called \"nom pang\") and may be stuffed with slices of ham or any number of grilled meats, with Kampot pepper, similar to Vietnamese banh mi. The French also introduced beer, butter, pate, coffee, chocolate, onions, carrots, broccoli, potatoes and many other types of non-native produce Southeast Asia.\n\nTraditionally, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four dishes. A meal will usually include a soup, or \"samlor\", served alongside the main courses. Each individual dish will be either sweet, sour, salty or bitter in taste. Chilli (fresh, pickled or dried) and chili sauce is served on the side and left up to individual diners and to their taste. In this way, Cambodians ensure that they get a bit of every flavor to satisfy their palates.\n\nIn Khmer cuisine, a distinction is made between fermented paste-based ingredients and pickled ingredients. \"Mam\" refers to fish or shrimp that has been fermented in a particular technique and is usually includes more solid pieces of the pickled animal. In a sense, \"mam\" is the general term when referring to most kind of fermented ingredients created from aquatic animals. \"Prahok\" and \"kapi\" are popular based for sauces that refer to pickled aged ingredients. Both \"mam\" and \"prahok\" are aged to a minimum of 1 year in order to reach its full potential in taste, much like fish sauce. Fermented sauce are often eaten with high protein-based dishes or raw vegetables to help the body digest.\n\nBlack pepper is the preferred choice when heat is wanted in a dish; it is used in stir fries, soups, marinades for grilled meats, and dipping sauces. Pepper has a long history in Cambodia, having been grown since at least the 13th century, while the pungent, aromatic variety from Kampot province (bordering Vietnam's Ha Tien province and the Gulf of Thailand to the south, and the jungle-clad Elephant Mountains to the north) was once Cambodia's chief export from the late 1800s up till the 1960s.\n\nKampot pepper was once known as the King of Peppers, revered by gourmets worldwide for its floral and eucalyptus notes, its heady aroma, its musky heat, and its medicinal properties. Before the 1970s, Kampot pepper was used in all French restaurants for the classic dish steak au poivre. Today, the pepper industry is being revitalised and, since acquiring protected Geographic Indication status in 2008 (which gives it the same special status as Champagne in France), people can purchase Kampot pepper online in many parts of the world.\n\nJungle cardamom, or wild cardamom, grows in the aptly named Cardamom Mountains in the southwest of the country, bordering the Gulf of Thailand coast to the south and Trat province in Thailand to the west. These vast mountains form some of the last remaining area of intact virgin rainforest in Southeast Asia and harbour extensive mangrove forests, elephants, tigers, Siamese crocodiles and other rare and endangered species, and few people live in this area. Locals use cardamom medicinally and in certain \"samlors\", using the root of the plant as well as the pod. Turmeric () is grown in Battambang province and is a common ingredient in many curry powders, soups and rice dishes. Saffron is also esteemed in local folk medicine as a treatment for many ailments, especially skin problems.\n\nTamarind is commonly employed as a soup base for dishes such as \"samlar machu\". Star anise is a must when caramelizing meat in palm sugar like pork in the dish known as \"pak lov\". Turmeric, galangal, ginger, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves are essential spices in Khmer cooking, Khmer stews, and nearly all curries.\n\n\nFrom India, Cambodians adapted the art of blending spices into a paste using many ingredients like cardamom, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and turmeric. Other native ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, garlic, shallots, cilantro, and kaffir lime leaves are added to this mix to make a distinctive and complex spice blend called \"kroeung.\" Other ingredients for kroeung used by Khmers in America are lemongrass, turmeric powder, garlic, prahok, and lemon leaf. This is an important aromatic paste commonly used in Cambodian cooking.\n\nMany vegetables used in Khmer cuisine are also used in Chinese cuisine. Vegetables such as winter melon, bitter melon, luffa, water spinach and yardlong beans can be found in soups and stews. Oriental squash can be stewed, stir fried or sweetened and steamed with coconut milk as a dessert. Vegetables like mushrooms, cabbage, baby corn, bamboo shoots, fresh ginger, \"kai-lan\" (\"Chinese kale\"), snow peas, and bok choy are commonly used in many stir fry dishes. Together these stir fry dishes are known by the generic term \"chhar\" (ឆា). Banana blossoms are sliced and added to some noodle dishes like \"nom banh chok\".\n\n\n\nFruits in Cambodia are so popular that they have their own royal court. The durian is considered the \"king,\" the mangosteen the \"queen,\" sapodilla the \"prince\" and the milk fruit (\"phlae teuk doh ko\") the \"princess.\" Other popular fruits include the \"jan\" fruit, kuy fruit, romduol, pineapple, star apple, rose apple, coconut, palmyra fruit, jackfruit, papaya, watermelon, banana, mango and rambutan. Although fruits are usually considered desserts, some such as ripe mangoes, watermelon, and pineapples are eaten commonly with heavily salted fish with plain rice. Fruits are also made into beverages called tuk krolok (), mostly shakes. Popular fruits for shakes are durian, mangoes, bananas.\n\nAs the country has an extensive network of waterways, freshwater fish plays a large part in the diet of most Cambodians, making its way into many recipes. Daily fresh catches come from the Mekong River, Bassac River and the vast Tonlé Sap. Fish is far more common than meat in Khmer cuisine and fish forms 60% of the Cambodian intake of proteins. \"Prahok\" itself is based on fish. Many of the fish eaten in Cambodia are freshwater fish from the Tonlé Sap or from the Mekong. Dried salted fish known as \"trei ngeat\" () are a favourite with plain rice porridge. The popular Khmer dish called \"amok\" uses a kind of catfish steamed in a savoury coconut-based curry. The small fish known as \"Trey Dang Dau\" are very common and are often eaten deep-fried.\n\nWhile freshwater fish is the most commonly used meat in the Cambodian diet, pork and chicken are also popular. Though not as common as in neighbouring Vietnam, vegetarian food is a part of Khmer cuisine and often favoured by more observant Buddhists.\n\nPork is quite popular in making sweet Khmer sausages known as \"kwah ko\" (). Beef and chicken are stewed, grilled or stir fried. Seafood includes an array of shellfish such as clams, cockles, crayfish, shrimp and squid. Lobsters are not commonly eaten because of their price, but middle-class and rich Cambodians enjoy eating them at Sihanoukville. Duck roasted in Chinese \"char siu\" style is popular during festivals. More unusual varieties of meat include frog, turtle, and arthropods (including tarantulas); these are difficult to find in Khmer cuisine abroad but are used in everyday dishes in Cambodia.\n\n\n\nMany elements of Cambodian noodle dishes were inspired by Chinese and Vietnamese cooking despite maintaining a distinct Khmer variation. Prahok is never used with noodle dishes. Rice stick noodles are used in \"mee katang\" (), which is a Cambodian variation of chǎo fěn with gravy. Unlike the Chinese styled chǎo fěn, the noodles are plated under the stir fry beef and vegetables and topped off with scrambled eggs. Burmese style noodles (, Mee Kola) is a vegetarian dish made from thin rice stick noodles, steamed and cooked with soy sauce and garlic chives. This is served with pickled vegetables Jroak (), julienned eggs, and sweet garlic fish sauce (which is actually not vegetarian) garnished with crushed peanuts. Mi Cha () is stir fried egg noodles.\n\nCambodian street foods (\"m'houp tam plouv\") are a combination of influences from China and Southeast Asia. There exist a variety that are often not known to people outside of Cambodia. Street food are the heart and tradition of Cambodian daily life and considered snacks rather than meals. Food stalls are called \"hang\" or \"tiam\", a Khmer word borrowed from Chinese \"háng\" (\"store\", \"business\") or \"hang bai\" (\"bai\" means \"rice\" or \"food\") and in order to identify the specific food for sale, food eateries are addressed as \"Hang/Tiam Kuy Teav\" (Rice noodle Stall) or \"Hang/Tiam Kafe\" (Coffee Stall), for example.\n\nCambodian features of variety of noodles in which different types of noodles are exchangeable for different broths, such as \"Kuy Teav\" broth eaten with \"Mee Sua\" noodle or \"Lort\". Khmer noodles have origins from Chinese influences and bear many the similarities to other noodles in Southeast Asia.\n\n\"Samlor\" refers to soup dishes that are eaten with rice and \"Sup\" refer to dishes that can be eaten without the need of rice, these usually being dishes of Chinese or European origin. Chhang Plerng refers to the general term of Hotpot that are popular eaten during the dry \"cold\" season (winter) and during late night gatherings.\n\nThe term \"Chha\" refers to stir frying techniques introduced by Chinese immigrants (from Hokkien \"Tshá\"). \n\nCambodian cuisine features a variety of desserts similar to its Southeast Asian neighbors. Its assortment of puddings are called \"Cha Houy Tuek\" (\"jelly\") or \"Babor P'aem\" (\"sweet porridge\") depending on the ingredients of the dish. Agar Agar jelly desserts are collectively called \"Sarai\".\n\nThe Khmer Krom are ethnic Khmer indigenous to large areas of what is today southern Vietnam. Khmer Krom cuisine is a fusion of traditional Khmer cooking with locally available ingredients and Vietnamese influences. Khmer culture is also especially influential in the Vietnamese cuisine of southern Vietnam. This is most evident in the sweetness of Vietnamese food and the wider variety of tropical herbs that are now shared by both Vietnam and Cambodia since the 17th century when Vietnam took control of the Mekong Delta region away from the remnants of the Khmer Empire. As a result, traditional Khmer cooking is an important component of Vietnam's diverse cuisine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "844568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844568", "title": "Fufu", "text": "Fufu\n\nFufu (variants of the name include foofoo, fufuo, foufou) is a staple food common in many countries in West Africa such as Sierra Leone, Ghana, Liberia, Togo and Nigeria. It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian method by mixing and pounding separate equal portions of cassava and green plantain flour thoroughly with water. It is then adjusted to either increase or decrease the viscosity of the fufu depending on personal preferences. Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour. Fufu is often served with groundnut soup, palm nut soup or light soup.\n\nThe traditional method is to boil starchy food crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough-like consistency. Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce. Foods made in this manner are known by different names in different places.\n\nPortuguese traders introduced the cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century. In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky (if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding). The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one's right hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball. The ball is then dipped in the soup before being eaten.\n\nIn Côte d'Ivoire, the word “\"foutou\"” is also used. Ivorian “\"foufou\"” is specifically sweet mashed bananas, whereas the “foutou” is a stronger, heavier pasta made of various staple foods such as yam, cassava, banana, taro or a mix of any of those.\n\nIn the French-speaking regions of Cameroon, it is called “\"couscous\"” (not to be confused with the North African dish couscous).\n\nA similar staple in the African Great Lakes region is ugali. It is usually made from maize flour (masa), and is also eaten in Southern Africa. The name ugali is used to refer to the dish in Kenya and Tanzania. Closely related staples are called nshima in Zambia, nsima in Malawi, sadza in Zimbabwe, pap or vuswa in South Africa, posho in Uganda, luku, fufu, nshima, moteke, semoule, ugali and bugari in the Republic of the Congo and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and phaletšhe in Botswana.\n\nIn Caribbean nations with substantial populations of West African origin, such as Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico, plantains, yuca or yams are mashed with other delectable ingredients (\"fufú nigeriano\"). In Cuba, the dish retains its original African stem name, termed simply as \"fufú\" or with added descriptive extensions like \"fufú de platano\" or \"fufú de platano pintón.\" On other major islands, \"fufú\" goes by the names of mangú in the Dominican Republic, mofongo in Puerto Rico and bammy in Jamaica. What distinguishes the Caribbean \"fufú\" from its West African relative is a firmer texture with stronger flavors. As it moves away from Cuba, the \"fufú's\" core is less a gelatinous dough and more of a consistent mass.\n\nPuerto Rican mofongo in keeping with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean tends toward a \"fufú\" of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a conspicuous African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island's Iberian culinary tradition, to create a dish made of fried green plantains, yuca or breadfruit. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African \"fufús\", mofongo is generally firmer and crustier.\nTo prepare mofongo, green plantains are deep-fried once unlike twice fried tostones. Next, they are mashed in a 'pilon' ( mortar ) with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil. The resulting mash is then pressed and rounded into a hollowed crusty orb. Meat, traditionally \"chicharrón\", is then stuffed into the chunky ball of fried green plantains. A few recipes call for a meat or vegetable \"salsa criolla\" \"(related to American Creole sauce) poured on top of the hot sphere. In the trendier \"mofongo relleno,\" typical of western Puerto Rico, seafood is all over, inside and outside. Traditional mofongo, as previously cited, comes seasoned and stuffed with meat and bathed in a chicken broth soup. Because of its elaborate process of preparation and its sundry ingredients, poet and blogger Arose N Daghetto called the mofongo a type of \"fufú paella\" and branded it as \"the big daddy of fufús.\"\"\"\n\nThe vegetable or fufú sauce in the Anglo-Caribbean is not fried first. Plantain is not used as much, as it is used in so many dishes. Fufu is usually part of, or added to, a soupy sauce or on the side with a soupy dish. In Antigua, fufu is served as part of the national dish but is called fungi/fungee and is made using cornmeal and okra. Similarly, in Barbados it serves as part of the national dish and is called \"cou cou\" and uses cornmeal or, less commonly, breadfruit instead, like several other English Caribbean islands. In Haiti it is called \"tum tum and Foofoo\". It is mostly made of breadfruit but can be made of plantain or yams and is usually served with an okra based stew or soup.\n\nFufu is believed to originate in what is modern-day Ghana, by the Asante, the Akuapem, the Guans, the Akyem, the Bono and the Fante peoples of the Akan ethnic group of Ghana. Today, it also features in Togolese cuisine, Guinean cuisine, Cameroonian cuisine, as well as Nigerian cuisine.\n\nFufu’s prevalence in the West African subregion has been noted in literature produced by authors from that area. It is mentioned in Chinua Achebe’s \"Things Fall Apart\", for example.\n\nIn Ghana, pieces of boiled cassava or other tubers are pounded together in a giant wooden mortar using a wooden pestle. In between blows from the pestle, the mixture is turned by hand and water gradually added till it becomes slurry and sticky. The mixture is then formed into a ball or a rounded slab and served. With the invention of the fufu machine preparation has become much less labour-intensive. \nNutritionally, 100 g dry weight fufu contains 2 g of protein, 0.1 g of fat and 84 g of carbohydrate. There are 267 kcal of food energy in a 100 g serving made up with water. It is very low in cholesterol. It is very rich in potassium, and it is commonly prescribed by doctors for people who have low level of potassium in their blood.\n\n"}

{"id": "847398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847398", "title": "Balsamic vinegar", "text": "Balsamic vinegar\n\nBalsamic vinegar (), occasionally shortened to balsamic, is a very dark, concentrated, and intensely flavoured vinegar originating in Italy, made wholly or partially from grape must. Grape must is freshly crushed grape juice with all the skins, seeds and stems.\n\nThe term \"\"aceto balsamico\"\" is unregulated, but there are three protected balsamic vinegars: \"\"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\"\" (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena), \"\"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia\"\" (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia), and \"\"Aceto Balsamico di Modena\"\" (Balsamic Vinegar of Modena). The two traditional balsamic vinegars are made the same way from reduced grape must aged for several years in a series of wooden barrels, and are produced exclusively in either the province of Modena or the wider Emilia region surrounding it. The names of these two vinegars are protected by the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin, while the usually less expensive Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (\"Aceto Balsamico di Modena\") is made from grape must blended with wine vinegar, and produced exclusively in either Modena or Reggio Emilia, with a Protected Geographical Indication status.\n\nBalsamic vinegar contains no balsam. The word \"balsamico\" (from Latin \"balsamum\", from Greek \"βάλσαμον\") means \"balsam-like\" in the sense of \"restorative\" or \"curative\".\n\nThere are three types of balsamic vinegar:\n\n\nThere are also many products that contain \"Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP\" as an ingredient, such as glazes or other condiments.\n\nOnly two consortia produce true traditional balsamic vinegar, Modena and neighboring Reggio Emilia. True balsamic vinegar is made from a reduction of pressed Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes. The resulting thick syrup, called \"mosto cotto\" in Italian, is subsequently aged for a minimum of 12 years in a battery of several barrels of successively smaller sizes. The casks are made of different woods like chestnut, cherry, oak, mulberry, ash and juniper. True balsamic vinegar is rich, glossy, deep brown in color, and has a complex flavour that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood from the casks.\n\nReggio Emilia designates the different ages of their balsamic vinegar (\"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia\") by label colour. A red label means the vinegar has been aged for at least 12 years, a silver label that the vinegar has aged for at least 18 years, and a gold label designates that the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.\n\nModena uses a different system to indicate the age of its balsamic vinegars (\"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\"). A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and a gold cap bearing the designation \"extravecchio\" (extra-old) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.\n\nThese commercial-grade products imitate the traditional product. They are made of wine vinegar with the addition of colouring, caramel and sometimes thickeners like guar gum or cornflour to artificially simulate the sweetness and thickness of the aged Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena. IGP status requires a minimum aging period of two months, not necessarily in wooden barrels, rising to three years when labeled as invecchiato (aged). As the manufacturing process is highly industrialized, the output of a medium-sized producer may be hundreds of litres per day.\nIn 2009, the European Commission inserted the Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (Aceto Balsamico di Modena) designation in the register of IGP productions.\n\n\"Condimento\" (dressing) balsamic vinegars may be labeled as \"condimento balsamico\", \"salsa balsamica\" or \"salsa di mosto cotto\". \nFor those products, there is a risk of creating confusion among consumers looking for the original Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI, the two different Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO, and Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia PDO.\n\n'Condimento' balsamic vinegar may be made in any of the following ways:\n\n\nAs there are no official standards or labeling systems to designate \"condimento\" balsamic vinegar, it can be hard to tell their quality based on the packaging alone.\n\nTraditional balsamic vinegar is produced from the juice of just-harvested white grapes (typically, Trebbiano grapes) boiled down to reach a minimum sugar concentration of 30% (brix) or more in the must, which is then fermented with a slow aging process which further concentrates the flavours. The flavour intensifies over the years, with the vinegar being stored in wooden casks, becoming sweet, viscous and very concentrated. During this period, a portion evaporates: it is said that this is the \"angels' share\", a term also used in the production of bourbon whiskey, scotch whisky, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.\n\nNone of the product may be withdrawn until the end of the minimum aging period of 12 years. At the end of the aging period (12, 18, or 25 years) a small portion is drawn from the smallest cask and each cask is then topped up with the contents of the preceding (next larger) cask. Freshly reduced cooked must is added to the largest cask and in every subsequent year the drawing and topping up process is repeated. This process where the product is distributed from the oldest cask and then refilled from the next oldest vintage cask is called solera or \"in perpetuum\".\n\nIn Emilia-Romagna, \"tradizionale\" vinegar is most often served in drops on top of chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano and mortadella as an antipasto. It is also used sparingly to enhance steaks, eggs, or grilled fish, as well as on fresh fruit such as strawberries and pears and on plain crema (custard) gelato. \"Tradizionale\" vinegar may be drunk from a tiny glass to conclude a meal.\n\nContemporary chefs use both \"Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO\" and \"Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI\" sparingly in simple dishes where the balsamic vinegar's complex tastes are highlighted, using it to enhance dishes like scallops or shrimp, or on simple pastas and risottos.\n\n"}

The related term churrascaria (or churrasqueria) is mostly understood to be a steakhouse.\n\nA \"churrascaria\" is a restaurant serving grilled meat, many offering as much as one can eat: the waiters move around the restaurant with the skewers, slicing meat onto the client's plate. This serving style is called \"espeto corrido\" or \"rodízio\", and is quite popular in Brazil, specially in southern states like Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo.\n\nIn Brazil, \"churrasco\" is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Chilean asado) which originated in southern Brazil. It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built \"churrasqueira\", a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. Portable \"churrasqueiras\" are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine, Chilean, Paraguayan and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian \"churrasqueiras\" do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the State of Rio Grande do Sul).\n\nIn Nicaragua, the first immigrant group to introduce the term for this cut of beef to the United States restaurant scene in Miami, Fl as early as the 1950s, it refers to a thin steak prepared grilled and served with a traditional chimichurri sauce- macerated parsley, garlic, peppers, and olive oil sauce.\n\nAlthough seldom accredited to Brazilians and Argentinians, these two nations' most popular cuts of grilled meats are not churrasco but Rib and Picanha (Brazil) and Entraña respectively.\n\nIn Argentina and Uruguay a \"churrasco\" refers to any boneless cut of beef that is sliced slightly thin as a steak and grilled over hot coals or on a very hot skillet. Gauchos would have grilled churrasco as part of their \"asado\", now the national dish of both countries, served with salad and fried or mashed potatoes, and sometimes a fried egg.\n\nIn Puerto Rico it always refers to skirt steak, cooked on a barbecue grill. The \"chimichurri\" sauce is optional, since the meat is very savory with just a slight hint of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking. It is also customary to replace chimichurri sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or \"Ajilimójili\" sauce.\n\nIn Ecuador \"churrasco\" is a staple food of the Coast Region, especially Guayaquil. The dish's main ingredient is the grilled steak that is seasoned with chimichurri, it is served with plantains, white rice, French fries, a fried egg, and slices of avocado.\n\nIn Guatemala, \"churrasco\" is regarded as a typical dish, often eaten in familiar gatherings and festive occasions. It is usually served topped with chirmol, a red sauce containing chopped tomatoes and onions, and accompanied by corn, guacamole, grilled potatoes, stewed black beans, rice and tortillas.\n\nIn Chile, \"churrasco\" refers to a thin cut of steak which varies depending on the desired quality of the sandwich. The slices are grilled and served in a -sometimes warmed- local bun (called \"marraqueta\", or \"pan batido\" in Valparaíso), usually accompanied with tomato, avocado and mayonnaise, in the case of a \"churrasco italiano\". Another popular dish, \"churrasco a lo pobre\" (\"poor man's churrasco\"), consists of a churrasco served with French fries, fried egg, and caramelized onions.\n\nIn Portugal, \"Frango de Churrasco\" with piri piri (a kind of salty roasted chicken cooked on the \"churrasqueira\", spiced with hot red chili sauce) is very popular. Portuguese churrasco and chicken dishes are very popular in countries with Portuguese communities, such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Venezuela and South Africa.\n\nThe term \"churrasco\" is used in former Portuguese colonies—a \"Churrasco Moçambicano\" is a grilled meat dish from Mozambique, for instance.\n\nIn Galicia, churrasco refers almost exclusively to grilled pork or beef spare-ribs. Galicians who emigrated to America in the 20th century took with them the recipe for churrasco. Nowadays, many Galicians of all social classes prepare a churrascada.\n\nIn North America, Churrasco is the trademark name for rotisserie/grills manufactured by Hickory Industries, Inc.\n"}

Variants are used for either desserts or dinners. When used as a dessert, it is commonly combined with a sweetener such as sugar. Such desserts are found on many continents, especially Asia where rice is a staple. Some variants are thickened only with the rice starch, others include eggs, making them a kind of custard.\n\nRice puddings are found in nearly every area of the world. Recipes can greatly vary even within a single country. The dessert can be boiled or baked. Different types of pudding vary depending on preparation methods and the selected ingredients. The following ingredients are usually found in rice puddings:\n\nThe following is a list of various rice puddings grouped by place of origin.\n\n\nMany dishes resembling rice pudding can be found in Southeast Asia, many of which have Chinese influences. Owing to Chinese usage, they are almost never referred to as rice pudding by the local populations (whether ethnic Chinese origin or not) but instead called sweet rice porridge. The term \"pudding\" in various modern East Asian languages denotes a cornstarch or gelatin-based jelly-like set dessert, such as mango pudding. The rice pudding dishes that follow are explicitly referred to as such by the originating cultures.\n\n\n\nIn the Nordic countries, rice porridge is a common breakfast and sometimes lunch. It is made as a warm dish from rice cooked in milk. When served, it is commonly sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and a small knob of butter, and served with milk or fruit juice. In Iceland, it is sometimes served with cold \"slátur\", a type of liver sausage. In different languages it is called \"risengrød\" (Danish), \"risengrynsgrøt\" (Norwegian), \"risgrynsgröt\" (Swedish), \"riisipuuro\" (Finnish), \"grjónagrautur\", \"hrísgrautur\" or \"hrísgrjónagrautur\" (Icelandic), and \"rísgreytur\" (Faroese).\n\nThe rice porridge dinner is used as a basis for rice cream dessert. There are many different variants of this dessert but the basis is the same: cold rice porridge (the dinner variant) is mixed with whipped cream and sweetened. In Sweden, it is sometimes mixed with oranges and is then called \"apelsinris\". \"Risalamande\" (Danish, after French \"riz à l'amande\", rice with almonds) is cold risengrød with whipped cream, vanilla, and chopped almond, often served with hot or chilled cherry (or strawberry) sauce. In Norway, the dessert is called \"riskrem\" and sometimes served with red sauce (usually made from strawberries or raspberries). Rice cream dessert is called \"ris à la Malta\" in Sweden, while what is referred to as \"risgrynspudding\" is made with eggs instead of cream.\n\nIn Scandinavia, rice pudding has long been a part of Christmas tradition, in some countries referred to as \"julegröt/julegrøt/julegrød/joulupuuro\" (Yule porridge) or \"tomtegröt/nissegrød\". The latter name is due to the old tradition of sharing the meal with the guardian of the homestead, called \"tomte\" or nisse (see also blót). In Finland it is common to eat the Christmas rice porridge with a sauce made of dried prunes.\n\nA particular Christmas tradition that is often associated with eating rice pudding or porridge is hiding a whole almond in the porridge. In Sweden and Finland, popular belief has it that the one who eats the almond will be in luck the following year. In Norway, Denmark, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, the one who finds it will get the almond present as a prize. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands, the almond tradition is usually done with risalamande served as dessert at Julefrokost (Christmas lunch) or on Christmas Eve. In Norway, it is commonly served as lunch or early dinner on Christmas Eve or the day before, \"lillejulaften\" (\"Little Eve\"). In Sweden and Finland, it is more commonly done with a rice porridge dinner, sometimes a few days before Christmas Eve.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, rice pudding is a traditional dessert.\n\nThe earliest rice pudding recipes were called \"whitepot\" and date from the Tudor period; one of the earliest recipes was written down by Gervase Markham in 1615. Rice pudding is traditionally made with pudding rice, milk, cream, and sugar and is sometimes flavoured with vanilla, nutmeg, jam and/or cinnamon. It can be made in two ways: in a saucepan or by baking in the oven.\n\nIn a saucepan, it is made by gently simmering the milk and rice until tender, and then the sugar is carefully mixed in. Finally, the cream is mixed in, and it can either be left to cool and be served at room temperature, or it can be heated and served hot. It should have a very creamy consistency.\nWhen made in the oven, the pudding rice is placed into a baking dish, and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in. The dish is then placed in the oven and baked at a low temperature for a few hours, until the rice is tender and the pudding has a creamy consistency. While cooking, the pudding may develop a thick crust, which adds an interesting texture to the pudding. It is traditional to sprinkle the top with finely grated nutmeg before baking. Using evaporated milk (9% milk fat), instead of whole milk, enriches the result and intensifies the caramelised flavour.\n\nAn alternative recipe frequently used in the north of England uses butter instead of cream, adds a small pinch of salt, and requires the pudding mixture to stand for an hour or so prior to being cooked. Such puddings tend to set firmly when cooled, enabling slices to be cut and eaten like cake. If eaten hot, the pudding is traditionally served with cream poured on top in wealthy households, and with full fat milk where cream was not available. A spoonful of sweet jam or conserve is also a very popular topping for the pudding.\n\nA specific type of rice is available and widely used for rice pudding called \"pudding rice\". Similar to Arborio rice, its grain is round and short, and when cooked produces a creamier consistency than savoury rice. However, other short grained rice can be used as a substitute.\n\nReady-made, pre-cooked rice pudding sold in tin cans or pots is very widely available in most supermarkets and shops. Because it is canned, it has a very long shelf life. A popular brand is Ambrosia. . Some brands are made with skimmed (fat free) milk.\n\nIn Canada and the United States, most recipes come from European immigrants. In the latter half of the twentieth century, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American recipes have also become more common. In New England, a popular pudding is made with long grain rice, milk, sugar, or in Vermont, maple syrup. This may be combined with nutmeg, cinnamon, and/or raisins. The pudding is usually partially cooked on top of the stove in a double boiler, and then \"finished\" in an oven.\n\n\nBuddhist Sutras state that Gautama Buddha's final meal before his enlightenment was a large bowl of rice pudding, prepared for him by a girl named Sujata.\n\nRice pudding is mentioned frequently in literature of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, typically in the context of a cheap, plain, familiar food, often served to children or invalids, and often rendered boring by too-frequent inclusion in menus.\n\nIn Edward Bulwer-Lytton's \"Kenelm Chillingly\", a would-be host reassures a prospective guest: \"Don't fear that you shall have only mutton-chops and a rice-pudding\". In Henry James' \"A Passionate Pilgrim\", the narrator laments: \"having dreamed of lamb and spinach and a salade de saison, I sat down in penitence to a mutton-chop and a rice pudding\".\n\nCharles Dickens relates an incident of shabby treatment in \"A Schoolboy's Story:\" \"it was imposing on Old Cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole Vacation, but that was just like the system. When they didn't give him boiled mutton, they gave him rice pudding, pretending it was a treat. And saved the butcher.\"\n\nIn Ethel Turner's \"Seven Little Australians\", the children express dissatisfaction with their food. \"My father and Esther ... are having roast fowl, three vegetables, and four kinds of pudding\", Pip says angrily. \"It isn't fair!\" His sister notes that \"we had dinner at one o'clock\". \"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!\" her brother replies, witheringly.\n\nIn Jane Austen's \"Emma\", reference to the combination of mutton and rice pudding is once again made - \"his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for\".\n\n\"Rice Pudding\" is the title and subject of a poem by A. A. Milne, in which the narrator professes puzzlement as to what is the matter with Mary Jane, who is \"crying with all her might and main/And she won't eat her dinner—rice pudding again—/What is the matter with Mary Jane?\"\n\nT.S. Eliot, in the poem \"Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town\", writes: \"If he looks full of gloom/Then he's lunched at The Tomb/On cabbage, rice pudding, and mutton.\"\n\nRice pudding is mentioned with much more affection in an incident related by Walt Whitman in \"Specimen Days\". Whitman visited an invalid soldier who \"was very sick, with no appetite ... he confess'd that he had a hankering for a good home-made rice pudding—thought he could relish it better than anything ... I soon procured B. his rice pudding. A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish, made the pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days.\"\n\nIn the play \"Arcadia\" by Tom Stoppard, Thomasina Coverly uses the example of stirring jam into rice pudding as an illustration of chaos. She wonders why it is not possible to separate the jam from the pudding by stirring backwards. Her tutor Septimus Hodge asserts that it is because our universe is deterministic, according to the theories of Isaac Newton.\n\nIn \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams the supercomputer Deep Thought derives the existence of rice pudding from first principles. This is to counterpoint between the complexity of Deep Thought and its task of exploring the eternal verities, with simplicity of the pudding.\n\n\n"}

It was originally a breakfast dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but is now eaten all over Switzerland and around the world. The French name \"röstis bernois\" makes direct reference to the origins of the dish. \n\nMany Swiss people consider rösti to be a national dish. Rather than considering it a complete breakfast, it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes such as \"Spinat und Spiegelei\" (spinach and fried eggs, sunny side up), cervelas or Fleischkäse. It is commonly available in Swiss restaurants as a replacement for the standard side dish of a given meal.\n\nRösti dishes are made with coarsely grated potato, either cooked or raw. The potatoes are either parboiled or grated raw. Depending on the frying technique, oil, butter or another fat may be added (and usually salt and pepper). It is also common to fry the grated potato without additional fats. The grated potatoes are shaped into rounds or patties, usually measuring between 3–12 cm (1 to 5 inches) in diameter and 1–2 cm (0.5 inch) thick. Rösti are most often pan-fried and shaped in the frying pan during cooking, but they can also be baked in the oven. Although basic rösti consists of nothing but potato, a number of additional ingredients are sometimes added, such as bacon, onion, cheese, apple or fresh herbs. This is usually considered to be a regional touch.\n\nIn Swiss popular cultural ethos, rösti are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. Rösti dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin culture. The geographic border separating the French- and German-speaking parts of the country is therefore commonly referred to as the \"Röstigraben\": literally the \"rösti ditch\".\n\n\n"}

During Gerovital's \"jet-set\" heyday, Gerovital treatments were reportedly administered to John F. Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Kirk Douglas and Salvador Dalí. In the United States, the FDA bans Gerovital H3 from interstate commerce as an unapproved drug and, since 1982, has prohibited its importation.\n\nGerovital is promoted with false claims of its curative abilities for a wide range of human ailments; research has found no evidence that it has any health benefit or \"antiaging\" properties.\n\nThe impetus for developing the drug is sometimes alleged to have come from Nicolae Ceaușescu, who funded the establishment of a research organization, the National Institute of Geriatrics, in Bucharest, Romania, headed by Ana Aslan (1897–1988). In fact, Aslan's research began years before, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nThe main active ingredient is the well-known local anesthetic procaine hydrochloride (often referred to by the old brand name, \"Novocaine\"). It also contains small amounts of benzoic acid, potassium metabisulfite and disodium phosphate which are said to be important in the formulation, rendering it more effective by \"stabilizing\" it. Some advocates acknowledge that despite the stabilizers, the procaine in Gerovital H3 breaks down rapidly into DEAE and PABA, but ascribe the beneficial effects to these breakdown products.\n\nFrom the 1950s until her death in 1988, Aslan promoted Gerovital H3 with great success. In the 1960s and 1970s her Romanian clinic, the Parhon Institute, became a mecca for celebrities seeking treatment, and an upscale tourist attraction. \"The New York Times\" referred to Gerovital's \"jet-set aura,\" noting that Aslan had been covered in \"society columns where such public figures as Nikita S. Khrushchev, Konrad Adenauer, and Ibn Saud have been listed among the multitudes said to have taken the drug.\" As late as 1988 an advertisement by the Romanian National Tourist Office lauded \"the picturesque and exciting cities, scenic delights, famous resorts (including Gerovital H3 treatment centers), cultural and historic treasures that await the traveler to Romania.\"\n\nWith the rise of the web Gerovital has enjoyed a new lease of promotional life as it is promoted by many sites with claims of its \"cure-all\" abilities.\n\nA 1973 \"New York Times\" article said \"cold water was thrown on [Gerovital]'s reputation years ago\" by \"three reports published simultaneously in British Medical Journal [that said it] found no merit for procaine hydrochloride for any of the problems of aging.\"\n\nSome clinical trials in the mid-to-late 1970s suggested that Gerovital H3 acts as a weak, competitive, reversible MAO inhibitor, and so may have some antidepressant value, but otherwise has negligible effect on disease. In 1994, the U.S. FDA Consumer magazine said: \"No health claims for Gerovital have been substantiated, and FDA considers it an unapproved new drug. It has caused low blood pressure, respiratory difficulties, and convulsions in some users.\" Suppliers assert that the product is safe, and one cites a brief quotation from a newspaper article that says \"while as early as 1973 Elmer Gardner of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs stated 'There is no safety problem with Gerovital H-3.'\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Gerovital is helpful in slowing aging or treating illness.\n\nProcaine itself is often considered to be a drug. Earlier references by advocates of Gerovital H3 refer to it as a drug. Hoffer and Walker (1980) call it a \"youth drug.\" Mircea Dumitru, Aslan's colleague and personal physician, describes it as \"a complex drug acting like the procaine molecule ... The addition of benzoic acid, potassium and disodium phosphate increase the effects of Gerovital-H3 biotrophic treatment.\" Web-based suppliers outside and inside the United States, that offer to ship the preparation to the U.S. generally characterize it as a \"nutrient\" \"vitamin\" or \"Dietary Supplement\", perhaps because of less strict legal treatment of nutritional supplements in the U. S. under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. A federal court in decision June 17, 1994, US vs Rodger Sless/TMI classified GeroVital H3 as a dietary supplement.\n\n, the FDA's 1982 automatic detention alert is still in effect and bans the import of Gerovital H3 into the U.S. as \"a new drug within the meaning of 201(p), without an approved new drug application [Unapproved New Drug, Section 505(a)].\"\n\nThe ban covers:\n"}

Their large size and light weight take little effort to propel; they travel very slowly and generally must be caught with two hands.\n\nThey became popular in the beach-themed films of the 1960s starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. These movies include \"Beach Party\", \"Muscle Beach Party\", \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\".\n\nBeach balls range from hand-sized to over across or larger. They generally have a set of soft plastic panels, with two circular end panels, one with an oral inflation valve, intended to be inflated by mouth or pump. A common design is vertical solid colored stripes alternating with white stripes. There are also numerous other designs, which include but are not limited to beach balls in a single solid color, promotional beach balls with advertisements or company slogans, as globes or as Emojis.\n\nSome manufacturers specify the size of their beach balls (which is often confused with the diameter) as the tip-to-tip length of a deflated ball (approximately half the circumference), or even the length of the panels before they have their ends cut and joined into a beach ball. Thus the actual diameter may be about formula_1 (≈ 0.6366…) of the nominal \"⌀\".\n\nMoreover, other sizes of beach balls exist, ranging from smaller to larger ones. There are beach balls that have a diameter of or even .\n\nThe world's largest beach ball was made in London, England on May 30, 2017. It was carried by a barge on River Thames. It had a diameter of with the word \"Baywatch\" written all over it. It was produced by Paramount Pictures to promote the 2017 movie \"Baywatch\". The record was registered by Guinness and the certificates were given to the members of the film's cast.\n\nBeach ball sports include water polo and volleyball. While they are much less expensive than the balls used in professional sports, they are also much less durable as most of them are made of soft plastic. Giant beach balls may be tossed between crowd members at concerts, festivals, and sporting events. Many graduates use beach balls as a prank during ceremonies, hitting them around the crowd. They are bounced around crowds at cricket, baseball and football games but frequently confiscated and popped by security. Some security personnel at these events might even inspect the beach ball's interior after tearing it, most likely searching for illegal items (e.g. narcotics) that might be transported inside the beach ball. The guards may also do this so that the beach ball cannot end up on the field and obstruct or distract players, as happened in August 1999, in a baseball game between the Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Angels, where the distraction caused by a beach ball on the field resulted in the Angels' defeat.\n\nTheir light weight and stability make beach balls ideal for trained seals to balance on their noses, which has become an iconic scene. Beach balls are also a popular prop used in swimsuit photography and to promote or represent beach-themed events or locations.\n\n"}

Although if it is in a cup, it is commonly referred to as a 'snowball'. The dessert consists of ice shavings that are topped with flavored sugar syrup.\n\nDepending on the region of North America, the terms \"snowball\" and \"snow cone\" may refer to different things. Where the distinction is made, the former refers to a dessert made of finely shaved ice (\"like soft fresh snow\"), while the latter contains ground-up ice that is coarser and more granular (\"crunchy\").\n\nIn the 1850s, the American Industrial Revolution made ice commercially available. Ice houses in New York would commonly sell ice to places like Florida. To transport the ice to Florida, the ice houses would send a wagon with a huge block of ice south. The route to Florida would pass right through Baltimore where children would run up to the wagon and ask for a small scraping of ice. Before long, mothers started to make flavoring in anticipation of their children receiving some ice. The first flavor the women made is still a Baltimore favorite: egg custard. Egg custard was an easy flavor to make as the only ingredients were eggs, vanilla, and sugar.\n\nBy the 1870s, the snowball's popularity had risen to the degree that in the warm summer months, theaters would sell snowballs to keep their patrons cool. Because of this association with the theater, snowballs were thought of as an upper-class commodity. Signs in theaters instructing patrons to finish their snowballs before coming in to the second act are the earliest tangible evidence of snowballs. In the theaters in Baltimore during the time hand shavers were used to shave the ice. Around the city, snowballs were served on newspaper, but in the classy theaters, butchers' boats were used. In the 1890s, many people started to invent easier ways to make snowballs. In that decade, patents for electric ice shavers were filed.\n\nDuring the Great Depression and World War II, snowballs became available outside of Baltimore. As snowballs were so cheap, they were one of the few treats that people could afford. This inexpensiveness earned snowballs the nicknames \"Hard Times Sundae\" and \"Penny Sunday\". People in need of a job could sell snowballs, as it required little overhead. The treat became more popular during World War II, when all available ice cream was sent to soldiers, creating a need for an icy treat. This newfound lack of competition helped snowballs become popular across the country.\n\nIn Hawaii, \"shave ice\" is similar to snowballs, and is sold in cone-shaped paper cups. \"Rainbow,\" a popular flavor, consists of three colors of syrup chosen usually for their color rather than their taste compatibility. Commonly, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or sweetened azuki beans is first added to the bottom of the cup and is capped with condensed milk.\n\nVendors in Texas and northern Mexico serve finely shaved ice desserts. Called a \"raspa\", they are usually sold from a roadside stand or trailer. They come in many flavors, including \"leche\" (milk and cinnamon) and \"picosito\" (the Spanish word for 'spicy' made with lemon and chili powder.). In central and southern Mexico it is called \"raspado\" (Spanish for 'shaved'), most commonly bought from street cart vendors, and both sugar syrups or chili flavors are added. In Costa Rica, these are called \"copos\" (Spanish for 'flake', as in 'ice flake') and are sold in a very similar fashion, though no spicy or chili options are available.\n\nThe dessert ais kacang served in Malaysia and Singapore is another form of shaved ice. Ais kacang was originally served with red beans but now includes various fruits and other sweet toppings.\n\nIn Japan they are known as kakigōri, and in India it is called a \"gola\" and usually served on popsicle sticks.\n\nIn Britain the term snowball is sometimes used, however it refers to a different treat. However Slush (beverage) are both similar (though more for drinking than eating) and are common in the UK. They are often served in the same places as ice creams.\n\nIn Perú this dessert is called Raspadilla, which is served in cups along with a spoon and/or a straw. It consists in ground ice which is thick and topped with juices of different flavors that can be combined, regularly the most common flavors are pineapple and strawberry juices but it can also be served with berries juice, passion fruit juice (maracuya), chicha morada (purple corn juice), and in some cases but uncommon it can be topped with condensed milk or yogurt. Its very popular in the beaches during summertime, but it also is consumed in the towns and the cities as well. It is sold in carts spread around some streets and avenues of the city, being prepared at the moment (some of them grind the ice in a block with a device or some spoon with a blade like razor in one end, others have the ice already ground stored in a coolerbox) but all of them serve the portion of ice in the cup in front of the customer and then ask which flavor of juice would be poured on top of the ice, then they put a spoon and the straw.\n\nIn France this dessert is called .\n\nIn the United States Virgin Islands (the American islands of St.Croix, St.Thomas, St.John, Water Island located in the Caribbean) a similar desert is called \"fraco\" (pronounced \"fray-co\") -- sometimes spelled \"fraico\".\n\n\"Kala Khatta\" is a syrup made from the jambul fruit in India and some other parts of South Asia. It is primarily used as a flavoring for Indian ice lollipops or popsicles, sold as street food. Crushed ice is formed into a lump by hand and mounted on a stick to make the lollipop.

In particular, ' often refers to the sandwiches made on Vietnamese baguettes, which may be called ', after the city in which they were popularized. However, even in Vietnam, \"a \" for breakfast\" implies a meat-filled sandwich for breakfast, not just bread.\n\nA folk etymology claims that the word ' is a corruption of the French ', meaning soft, white bread. However, \" or its Nôm form has referred to rice cakes and other pastries since as early as the 13th century, centuries before French contact.\n\nThe word , meaning \"bread\", is attested in Vietnamese as early as the 1830s, in Jean-Louis Taberd's dictionary '. French colonists introduced Vietnam to the baguette, along with other baked goods such as pâté chaud, in the 1860s, when Vietnam was part of French Indochina. Northern Vietnamese initially called the baguette ', literally \"Western bánh\", while southern Vietnamese called it , \"wheat bánh\". Nguyễn Đình Chiểu mentions the baguette in his 1861 poem \"\". Due to the price of imported wheat at the time, French baguettes and sandwiches were considered luxury items. During World War I, an influx of French soldiers and supplies arrived. At the same time, disruptions of wheat imports led bakers to begin mixing in inexpensive rice flour (which also made the bread fluffier). As a result, for ordinary Vietnamese to enjoy French staples such as bread became possible. Many shops baked twice a day, because bread tends to go stale more quickly in the Vietnamese climate. Baguettes were mainly eaten for breakfast with some butter and sugar.\n\nUntil the 1950s, sandwiches hewed closely to French tastes, typically a \"jambon-beurre\" moistened with a mayonnaise or liver spread. The 1954 Partition of Vietnam sent over a million migrants from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, transforming Saigon's local cuisine. Among the migrants were and , who opened a small bakery named in District 3. In 1958, became one of the first shops to sell '. Around this time, another migrant from the North began selling sandwiches from a basket on a mobylette, and a stand in Gia Định Province (present-day Phú Nhuận District) began selling sandwiches. Some shops stuffed sandwiches with inexpensive Cheddar cheese, which came from French food aid that migrants from the North had rejected. Vietnamese communities in France also began selling '.\n\nAfter the Fall of Saigon in 1975, \"\" sandwiches became a luxury item once again. During the so-called \"\", state-owned \"phở\" eateries often served bread or cold rice as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping in \"phở\". In the 1980s, Đổi Mới market reforms led to a renaissance in , mostly as street food.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnamese Americans brought \"bánh mì\" sandwiches to cities across the United States. In Northern California, and his sons are credited with popularizing \"\" among Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese Americans alike through their food truck services provider and their fast-food chain, Lee's Sandwiches, beginning in the 1980s. Sometimes was likened to local sandwiches. In New Orleans, a \"Vietnamese po' boy\" recipe won the 2009 award for best po' boy at the annual Oak Street Po-Boy Festival. A restaurant in Philadelphia also sells a similar sandwich, marketed as a \"Vietnamese hoagie\".\n\nA Vietnamese baguette has a thin crust and white, airy crumb. It may consist of both wheat flour and rice flour.\n\nBesides being made into a sandwich, it is eaten alongside meat dishes, such as \"bò kho\" (a beef stew), curry, and \"\". It can also be dipped in condensed milk (see Sữa Ông Thọ).\n\nA sandwich typically consists of one or more meats, accompanying vegetables, and condiments. Common fillings include steamed, pan-roasted or oven-roasted seasoned pork belly, Vietnamese sausage, grilled pork, grilled pork patties, spreadable pork liver , pork floss, grilled chicken, chicken floss, canned sardines in tomato sauce, soft pork meatballs in tomato sauce (), head cheese, mock duck, and tofu. Accompanying vegetables typically include fresh cucumber slices, cilantro (leaves of the coriander plant) and pickled carrots and white radishes in shredded form (). Common condiments include spicy chili sauce, sliced chilis, Maggi seasoning sauce, and mayonnaise.\n\nAs with Western sandwiches, a wide variety of popular fillings are used. A typical shop in the United States offers at least 10 varieties.\n\nThe most popular variety of Vietnamese sandwich is ', \"thịt\" meaning \"meat\". ' (also known as ', ', or \"special combo\") is made with various Vietnamese cold cuts, such as sliced pork or pork belly, \"chả lụa\" (pork sausage), and head cheese, along with the liver \"\" and vegetables like carrot or cucumbers.\n\nOther varieties include:\n\n\nThe Vietnamese sandwich has been adapted to Lao cuisine as \"khao chī\" () and to Cambodian cuisine as \"num pang\" ().\n\nPrior to the Fall of Saigon in 1975, well-known South Vietnamese \" vendors included and (which opened in 1968).\n\nIn regions of the United States with significant populations of Vietnamese Americans, numerous bakeries and fast food restaurants specialize in '. Lee's Sandwiches, a fast food chain with locations in several states, specializes in Vietnamese sandwiches served on French baguettes (or traditional ' at some locations) as well as Western-style sandwiches served on croissants. In New Orleans, Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery is known for the ' bread that it distributes to restaurants throughout the city. After 1975, owner Võ Văn Lẹ fled to the United States and, along with , founded . The Eden Center shopping center in Northern Virginia has several well-known bakeries specializing in '.\n\nMainstream fast food chains have also incorporated ' and other Vietnamese dishes into their portfolios.

Often other toppings are also added, such as cheese, onions, and mustard. The style has multiple regional variations in the United States, many calling for specific and unique sauce ingredients, types of hot dogs, or types of buns and referred to regionally under region-specific names.\n\nIn New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the \"Texas hot dog\", \"Texas chili dog.\" \"Texas hot',\" or \"Texas wiener\" is a hot dog with chili or hot sauce; it is served in variations with assorted condiments. The Texas wiener was created in Paterson, New Jersey, before 1920 and in Altoona, Pennsylvania, by Peter \"George\" Koufougeorgas in 1918 and originally called Texas Hot Wieners. The \"Texas\" reference is to the chili sauce used on the dogs, which actually has a stronger Greek cuisine influence due to the ethnicity of the cooks who invented it. It is considered a unique regional hot dog style. From its origins, the invention spread to the Pennsylvania cities of Scranton and Philadelphia. By the 1920s, it had reached Western New York, where numerous longstanding hot dog stands still remain, including a stand run by the Rigas Family (dating to 1921) and Ted's Hot Dogs (which opened in 1927).\n\nIn southeastern Michigan, a Coney Island hot dog is a European-style \"Frankfurter Würstel\" (Vienna sausage) of German origin with a natural lamb or sheep casing, topped with a beef heart-based sauce, which was developed by Greek immigrants in the area. It has several local variations, including Detroit style, Flint style, and Jackson style.\n\nIn Rhode Island the hot wiener or New York System wiener is a staple of the food culture and is served at \"New York System\" restaurants. The traditional wiener is made with a small, thin hot dog made of veal and pork, giving it a different taste from a traditional beef hot dog, served in a steamed bun, and topped with celery salt, yellow mustard, chopped onions, and a seasoned meat sauce.\n\nIn the North Country of New York State, a Michigan hot dog, or \"Michigan\", is a steamed hot dog on a steamed bun topped with a meaty sauce, generally referred to as \"Michigan sauce.\"\n\nIn Greater Cincinnati, Cheese coneys or Coney Islands (without the cheese) are hot dogs in buns topped with Cincinnati chili (a Greek-inspired meat sauce), onions, mustard, and cheese.\n\nIn North Carolina, hot dogs topped with chili, onions, and either mustard or slaw are referred to as \"Carolina style\", which is also used to refer to hamburgers with similar toppings.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the half-smoke is similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "858665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858665", "title": "Luxury goods", "text": "Luxury goods\n\nIn economics, a luxury good (or upmarket good) is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a greater proportion of overall spending.\n\nLuxury goods are in contrast to necessity goods, where demand increases proportionally less than income. \"Luxury goods\" is often used synonymously with \"superior goods\" and \"Veblen goods\".\n\nThe word \"luxury\" originated from the Latin word “Luxus,” which means indulgence of the senses, regardless of cost.\n\nLuxury goods have high income elasticity of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy proportionately more luxury goods. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop more than proportionately. Income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. That is to say, a luxury good may become a necessity good or even an inferior good at different income levels.\n\nSome luxury products have been claimed to be examples of Veblen goods, with a positive price elasticity of demand: for example, making a perfume more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good to such an extent that sales can go up, rather than down.\n\nAlthough the technical term luxury good is independent of the goods' quality, they are generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price. Classic luxury goods include haute couture clothing, accessories, and luggage. Many markets have a luxury segment including, for example, automobile, yacht, wine, bottled water, coffee, tea, foods, watches, clothes, jewelry, and high fidelity.\n\nLuxuries may be services. The hiring of full-time or live-in domestic servants is a luxury reflecting disparities of income. Some financial services, especially in some brokerage houses, can be considered luxury services by default because persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them.\n\nLuxury goods often have special luxury packaging to differentiate the products from mainstream competitors.\n\nThe three dominant trends are the main factors that have accelerated the rapid growth of the industry, including the customer base and variations in the consumptions of different brands. The three dominant trends in the global luxury goods market are globalization, consolidation, and diversification. Consolidation involves the growth of big companies and ownership of brands across many segments of luxury products. Examples include LVMH, Richemont, and Kering, which dominate the market in areas ranging from luxury drinks to fashion and cosmetics. Global consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, are also attracted to the industry, due to the difficulty of making a profit in the mass consumer goods market. The customer base for various luxury goods continue to be more culturally diversified, and this presents more unseen challenges and new opportunities to companies in this industry.\n\nThe luxury goods market has been on an upward climb for many years. Apart from the setback caused by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the industry has performed well, particularly in 2000. In that year, the world luxury goods market – which includes drinks, fashion, cosmetics, fragrances, watches, jewelry, luggage, handbags – was worth close to $170 billion and grew 7.9 percent. The United States has been the largest regional market for luxury goods and is estimated to continue to be the leading personal luxury goods market in 2013, with a value of 62.5 billion euros. The largest sector in this category was luxury drinks, including premium whisky, Champagne, Cognac. This sector was the only one that suffered a decline in value (-0.9 percent). The watches and jewelry section showed the strongest performance, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while the clothing and accessories section grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to $32.8 billion. North America is the largest regional market for luxury goods. The largest ten markets for luxury goods account for 83 percent of overall sales, and include Japan, China, United States, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland.\n\nIn 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market. China's luxury consumption accounts for over 25% of the global market. The Economist Intelligence Unit published a report on the outlook for luxury goods in Asia which explores the trends and forecasts for the luxury goods market across key markets in Asia. In 2014, the luxury sector is expected to grow over the next 10 years because of 440 million consumers spending a total of 880 billion euros, or $1.2 trillion.\n\nThough often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing, \"luxury\" remains a legitimate and current technical term in art history for objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials. The term is especially used for medieval manuscripts to distinguish between practical working books for normal use, and fully illuminated manuscripts, that were often bound in treasure bindings with metalwork and jewels. These are often much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations, and if liturgical texts were originally usually kept on the altar or sacristy rather any library that the church or monastery who owned them may have had. Secular luxury manuscripts were commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books.\n\n\"Luxury\" may be used for other applied arts where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made. This might cover metalwork, ceramics, glass, arms and armour, and a wide range of objects. It is much less used for objects with no function beyond being an artwork: paintings, drawings and sculpture, even though the disparity in cost between an expensive and cheap work may have been as large.\n\nWith increasing \"democratization\" of luxury goods, new product categories have been created within the luxury market, called \"accessible luxury\" or \"mass luxury\". These are meant specifically for the middle class, which sometimes called the \"aspiring class\" in this context. Because luxury has now diffused into the masses, defining the word has become more difficult.\n\nBringing up to the modern day the long and generally very unsuccessful history of sumptuary laws designed to curb excessive personal consumption, in February 2013, the Chinese government banned advertisements for luxury goods on its official state radio and television channels.\n\nSeveral manufactured products attain the status of \"luxury goods\" due to their design, quality, durability or performance that are remarkably superior to the comparable substitutes. Thus, virtually every category of goods available on the market today includes a subset of similar products whose \"luxury\" is marked by better-quality components and materials, solid construction, stylish appearance, increased durability, better performance, advanced features, and so on. As such, these luxury goods may retain or improve the basic functionality for which all items of a given category are originally designed.\n\nThere are also goods that are perceived as luxurious by the public simply because they play a role of status symbols as such goods tend to signify the purchasing power of those who acquire them. These items, while not necessarily being better (in quality, performance, or appearance) than their less expensive substitutes, are purchased with the main purpose of displaying wealth or income of their owners. These kinds of goods are the objects of a socio-economic phenomenon called \"conspicuous consumption\" and commonly include luxury vehicles, watches, jewelry, designer clothing, yachts, as well as large residences, urban mansions, and country houses.\n\nA luxury brand or prestige brand is a brand for which a majority of its products are luxury goods. It may also include certain brands whose names are associated with luxury, high price, or high quality, though few, if any, of their goods are currently considered luxury goods.\n\nLVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) is the largest luxury good producer in the world with over fifty brands, including Louis Vuitton, the brand with the world's first fashion designer label. The LVMH group made a net profit of €8.1 billion on sales of €42.6 billion in 2017. Other market leaders include Richemont and Kering (previously named PPR).\n\nA rather small group in comparison, the wealthy tend to be extremely influential. Once a brand gets an \"endorsement\" from members of this group, then the brand can be defined as a true \"luxury\" brand. An example of different product lines in the same brand is found in the automotive industry, with \"entry-level\" cars marketed to younger, less wealthy consumers, and higher-cost models for older and more wealthy consumers.\n\nThe advertising expenditure for the average luxury brand is 5-15% of sales revenue, or about 25% with the inclusion of other communications such as public relations, events and sponsorships.\n\nSince the uprising of the 'luxury brand' in the 1800s, department stores dedicated to selling all major luxury brands have popped up in most major cities around the world. Le Bon Marche located in Paris, France is credited for being one of the first of its kind, but also Neiman Marcus, Selfridges, Lane Crawford, Isetan, Fortnum & Mason, Lord & Taylor, Harvey Nichols, Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, David Jones, KaDeWe, Harrods and Holt Renfrew are seen as some of the most influential and historical.\n\nFashion brands within the luxury goods market tend to be concentrated in exclusive or affluent districts of cities around the world.

{"id": "858756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858756", "title": "Bogan", "text": "Bogan\n\nBogan ( ) is Australian and New Zealand slang for a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour are considered unrefined or unsophisticated. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or self-deprecating. The prevalence of the term bogan has also been associated with changing social attitudes towards social class in Australia. Specifically, the term has been related to the decline of masculine conceptions of meritocracy in Australia, and a growing ambivalence towards traditional sites of working class culture. \n\nSince the 1980s, the bogan has become a very well-recognised subculture, often as an example of bad taste. It has antecedents in the Australian larrikin and ocker, and various localised names exist that describe the same or very similar people to the bogan.\n\nThe origin of the term \"bogan\" is unclear; both the \"Macquarie Dictionary\" and the \"Australian Oxford Dictionary\" cite the origin as unknown. Some Sydney residents' recollection is that the term is based on the concept that residents of the Western Suburbs (stereotyped as \"Westies\") displayed what are now termed \"bogan\" characteristics and that an individual who displayed these characteristics to a strong extent was as \"west\" as the Bogan River in western New South Wales. According to another anecdote, the term emerged in Melbourne's outer-western and outer-eastern suburbs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe term became widely known in the late 1980s when the teenage character Kylie Mole (played by Mary-Anne Fahey), in the Australian sketch comedy television series \"The Comedy Company\", frequently used the term to disparage anyone she disliked. The same program included a sketch about a magazine called \"Bogue\" (a parody of \"Vogue\"), which featured traditional bogans. Merrick and Rosso (from Melbourne) also used the term on their Triple J national radio show.\n\nThe Australian National Dictionary Centre (ANDC) included the word in its Australian dictionary project in 1991 and said the earliest use they found was in the September 1985 issue of surfing magazine \"Tracks\": \"So what if I have a Mohawk and wear Dr. Martens (boots for all you uninformed bogans)?\"\n\nIn 2019, Bruce Moore of the Australian National University published a piece in \"The Conversation\", in which he suggested an earlier usage or origin of the word, discovered by historian Helen Doyle: an article in a student magazine published at Melbourne's Xavier College in 1984, which describes a fictional toy—the \"bogan doll\"—which possesses many characteristics of the bogan stereotype.\n\nThere are places in western New South Wales that contain \"bogan\" in their name—for example Bogan Shire, the Bogan River and the rural village of Bogan Gate. Bogan Gate, for example, is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning \"the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe\". Residents of streets such as Bogan Place and Bogan Road have been moved to action by the negative connotations of their street names and lobbied to rename them, prompting Ku-ring-gai mayor Nick Ebbeck to joke that he was a bit of a bogan himself. The 1902 poem \"City of Dreadful Thirst\" by Australian poet Banjo Paterson makes reference to a \"Bogan shower\" as a term meaning \"three raindrops and some dust\", although this is likely a reference to the dry area around the Bogan River. Makeshift gates in a rural fence in northwest NSW were known as \"bogan gates\" at least as early as the 1960s.\n\nSome features regularly associated with the bogan stereotype include residing in the outer working class suburbs of larger cities, having teeth that haven't had dental care due to cost, having an anti-authoritarian or jingoistic stance, as well as being interested in classic rock music, hoon driving and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nCertain types of clothing are stereotypically associated with bogans, including flannelette shirts, Blue Singlets, Stubbie shorts, Fluro workwear, ugg boots, jeans and black leggings.\n\nOther distinguishing features are mullet hair cuts, Winfield Blue and Peter Jackson cigarettes, Australian-only beer (especially regional state beers like Victoria Bitter).\n\nVehicles such as earlier Holdens from FJ to HQ, Toranas, some Commodores, (more so sports variants, especially Peter Brock Commodores), SS models, HSV, and Ford Falcon right up to AU models, particularly modified or poorly-maintained examples, also have similar associations.\n\nA person described as a bogan may refuse to conform to middle-class standards of taste, dietary habits, leisure activities, styles of dress and ways of speaking, and might be looked down upon by some groups due to preconceived perceptions and biases which can often make the lives of disadvantaged people much tougher.\n\nMel Campbell argued in a 2006 article in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" that bogan (including \"cashed-up bogan\") is a nebulous, personal concept that is frequently used in a process by which \"we use the idea of the bogan to quarantine ideas of Australianness that alarm or discomfort us. It's a way of erecting imaginary cultural barriers between 'us' and 'them'.\" Campbell argues that though many people believe they know exactly what a bogan is and what their characteristics might be, there is no defined set of characteristics of a bogan: the speaker imagines the denoted person to be different from, and less cultured than, themselves. Campbell considered \"cashed-up bogan\" to be a \"stupid term\". A similar argument is made by David Nichols, author of \"The Bogan Delusion\" (2011), who says that people have \"created this creature that is a lesser human being to express their interclass hatred\".\n\nBy the 21st century, the term bogan came to be employed more favourably to indicate a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that 'bogan' is no longer just being used as an insult, but is in fact a way to identify with the 'Aussie' culture that many Anglo‐Saxon Australian citizens are proud of. In the past, bogan was a term of disdain, but nowadays it has become 'cool' to be a bogan. Radio station Triple J held a \"National Bogan Day\" on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by rock bands such as Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and AC/DC. In a 2011 study, linguistics students at the University of Auckland found that the term was likely to be thought of as positive by people under the age of 30, compared with over-30s who generally felt it was more of a negative term.\n\nThe typical bogan has been portrayed on television in shows such as \"Outrageous Fortune\", \"Bogan Hunters\", \"Pizza\", \"Housos\", \"Bogan Pride\", \"Kath & Kim\", and \"Upper Middle Bogan\".\n\nPeter (pronounced 'Poi-da') was a recurring bogan character played by Eric Bana on the comedy sketch show Full Frontal.\n\nIn the 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\", DC Comics villain Captain Boomerang—a classically Australian character—has been reinvented as a bogan instead of his typical garish personality.\n\nThe popular website (and 2010 bestselling book) \"Things Bogans Like\" contains 250 articles on various things that bogans are claimed to like, and suggests that a \"bogan today defies income, class, race, creed, gender and logic\".\n\nIn 2007 Microsoft deemed \"bogan\" to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of Microsoft Office 2007. The word entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in June 2012.\n\nThe word \"bogan\" attracts negative attention online towards Anglo-Australians, and consequently boganbroadcast is actively campaigning to reclaim the term in a positive way.\n\nAn app known as \"The Bogan Test\" has been created to examine a person's likelihood to fall within the boundaries of the bogan category.\n\nAustralian ska-punk band Area-7 achieved one of their biggest hits with the song \"Nobody Likes A Bogan\", released in 2002.\n\n\"CUB\" or \"cashed up bogan\", was used by one marketing researcher in 2006 to describe people of a blue-collar background now earning a high salary and spending their earnings on expensive consumer items as a matter of conspicuous consumption. The media have cited tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and his actress wife, Bec Cartwright, as examples. Subsequently, the Kaesler Winery, in the Barossa Valley, released a Shiraz wine under the name Bogan.\n\nRoz Rohen has described the term 'bogan' as peerless, and that it warrants acceptance as an Australian keyword.\nAlthough the term \"bogan\" is understood across Australia and New Zealand, certain regions have their own slang terms for the same group of people. These terms include:\n\n\n\"Westie\" or \"westy\" is not synonymous with bogan, although westies are often stereotyped as being bogans. \"Westie\" predates bogan, originating in Sydney in the 1970s to refer to people from that city's western suburbs. As Sydney's western suburbs are predominantly working class blue collar areas, the term connotes a predominantly working class blue collar person – someone with little education, little taste, and very limited horizons. \"Westie\" is now in wide use in many cities and towns across both Australia and New Zealand, where it especially refers to the denizens of West Auckland.\n\n\nInternational:\n\nConcepts:\n\n"}

Probably originating from ethnic Lao people, it is also eaten throughout Southeast Asia. Locally known in Cambodia as bok l'hong (, ), in Laos as tam som () or the more specific name tam maak hoong (, ), in Thailand as som tam (, ), and in Vietnam as gỏi đu đủ. \"Som tam\", the Thai variation, was listed at number 46 on \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" compiled by \"CNN Go\" in 2011 and updated in 2018.\n\nThe green papaya salad was adapted from an ethnic Lao dish known as \"tam som\" (literally \"pounding [of] sour [ingredients]\"), which used local fruits and vegetables such as green (unripe) mango or cucumbers as the main ingredient, seasoned to a primarily sour flavour. Although green papaya salad is deeply linked to Laos and the Lao ethnic region of Isan, unfortunately, like most dishes in Southeast Asia, its true origins were not recorded. This is mainly because, until recently, more emphasis were placed on the oral tradition than to the written or literary tradition.\n\nFollowing the Columbian Exchange, non-native crops such as tomato, papaya, corn, pineapple and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia probably through the various sea ports of modern day Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam via the Philippines and Malacca. Through trades with the Portuguese and other Europeans cultivation of non-native crops and ingredients quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia. Thailand being one of the entry points where the Europeans have traded and where the papaya was introduced to mainland Southeast Asia have led some to speculate that the dish may have had a Thai origin. According to historian Sujit Wongthes, the variant of \"tam som\" using papaya as the main ingredient probably originated in the communities of ethnic Chinese–Lao settlers living in the Chao Phraya plains of what is now Central Thailand—where it became known as \"som tam\"—during the early Rattanakosin period (late 18th to early 19th centuries). The new dish, along with the papaya, then spread to today's Northeast Thailand (Isan) following the construction of the Northeastern railway line during the turn of the 19th–20th centuries, and became more popular after the opening of Mittraphap Road in 1957 helped bring new papaya cultivars into the region. The dish has since become widely adopted by the ethnic Lao people of both Isan and Laos. Likewise, the hot flavour also spread to Isan and Laos from Central Thailand, which had been introduced to chilli peppers first.\n\nHowever, earliest historical records show that by mid-1500s, the Europeans were already exploring and trading with mainland Southeast Asia reaching as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Laos. Some of the more notable Europeans who had travelled as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang or wrote extensively about their experiences were Fernão Mendes Pinto (1542-1545), Diogo Veloso and Blas Ruiz (1596), Geebard van Wusthof (1641), Giovanni Filippo de Marini (1642-1648), Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix(1830) and Henri Mouhot (1861). By the time Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix arrived as missionary to Bangkok; the papaya and chilli peppers was already fully integrated in the Lao territory and the Southeast Asian food culture as a whole. Even Henri Mouhot (May 15, 1826 - November 10, 1861), the French explorer and \"discoverer\" of Angkor Wat, during his trip to Luang Prabang, Laos also noted that the Laotians absolutely adores chili peppers.\n\nAccording to a cultural anthropologist Penny Van Esterik, during the 50s and 60s, green papaya salad was rarely known among the Central Thais and can only be found where there are small gatherings of Lao or Northeasterners: \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s glutinous rice, roast chicken, laab, somtam (papaya salad), and other Lao favorites were available in Bangkok only around the boxing stadium where northeastern boxers and fans gathered to eat \nand drink before and after boxing matches. Lao food could also be found outside \nconstruction sites in mobile food carts providing construction workers from the \nnortheast with their regional foods and beside gas stations serving long-distance\n\nbus drivers.\n\nIn fact, the opening of the Mittraphap Road and the northeastern railway connecting central Thailand to her northern provinces not only brought jobs and development to the region. It also created a gateway for one of Thailand's biggest inter-regional migration during the economic boom of the 1980s as demands for labour increased. It was estimated that between 1980-1990 approximately 1.1 million northeasterners had moved from the Northeast to central Thailand and Bangkok. This, in turn, helped popularize and create an unprecedented demand for Lao food outside of Laos and the Northeast.\n\nVan Esterik, also noted that, \"[i]n attempting to include northeastern food in a standardized national cuisine, middle-class Bangkok selected and modified the taste of a few dishes—grilled chicken, somtam, laab—by reducing the chili peppers and increasing the sugar, and ignored other dishes such as fermented fish and insects.\". According professor Sirijit Sunanta these dishes were then represented as “Thai food” when presented to the world.\n\nThe dish combines the five main tastes of the local cuisine: sour lime, hot chili, salty, savory fish sauce, and sweetness added by palm sugar. The ingredients are mixed and pounded in a mortar. As the name \"tam som\" suggests, sourness is a dominant taste; however, the more specific Lao name \"tam maak hoong\" literally means \"pounded papaya\". In Khmer, the name \"bok l'hong\" also means \"pounded papaya\". In Thai, the name \"som tam\" is simply a reversal of the Lao name. However, other pounded salads in Thailand are consistent with the Lao naming convention in which the word \"tam\" (\"pounded\") is listed first.\n\nDespite the use of papaya, which one may think of as sweet, this salad is actually savory. When not yet ripe, papaya does not have a tangy flavor. The texture is crisp and firm, sometimes to the point of crunchiness. It is this that allows the fruit to withstand being beaten in the mortar.\n\nIn Laos, green papaya salad is one of the traditional staples of the Lao. Pounded salads in Laos all fall under the parent category of \"tam som\", which may or may not contain green papaya, however, when no specific type of \"tam som\" is mentioned, it is generally understood to refer to green papaya salad. For absolute clarity, however, the name \"tam maak hoong\" may be used, since this name means \"pounded papaya\".\n\nIn Thailand, it is customary that a customer ask the preparer to make the dish suited to his or her tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as or \"som tam Lao\" or simply as \"tam Lao\", and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as \"som tam Thai\".\n\nTraditionally, the local variety of green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok is very hot due to the addition of a fistful of chopped hot bird's eye chili. However, with its rising popularity among tourists, it is now often served not as hot.\n\nTogether with the papaya, some or most of the following secondary items are added and pounded in the mortar with the pestle:\n\nGreen papaya salad is often served with glutinous rice and \"kai yang\"/\"ping gai\" (grilled chicken). It can also be eaten with fresh rice noodles (Lao: \"sen khao poon\" / Thai: \"khanom chin\") or simply as a snack by itself with, for instance, crispy pork rinds. The dish is often accompanied by raw vegetables on the side to mitigate the spiciness of the dish.\n\nGreen papaya salad is claimed as an innovation of the Lao people. Variations of the dish are found throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and as well as in the West, where it is more commonly known by its Thai name.\n\nA non-spicy green papaya salad version also exists in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, which is much sweeter; it often contains crushed peanuts, and is less likely to have padaek or brined crab. Dried brine shrimp are used in this Central Thai version. There are also versions that make use of unripe mangoes, apples, cucumbers, carrots, and other firm vegetables or unripe fruit. Besides using varieties of fruits or vegetables as the main ingredient a popular option is to use vermicelli rice noodle wherein the dish is known as \"tam sua\".\n\nInstead of papaya, other ingredients can be used as the main ingredient. Popular variations in Laos and Thailand include:\n\n\n\n"}

While the term is usually used only to refer to the copper-red version of chestnut, sometimes it is used generically in place of \"chestnut\" to refer to any reddish horse with a same-color or lighter mane and tail, ranging from reddish-gold to a deep burgundy or chocolate shade. The term probably comes from the color of the flower spike of the sorrel herb. \n\nChestnut is more often used to describe this color in England and on the east coast of the United States, while the term \"sorrel\" is more common in the Western United States. Some horse enthusiasts insist that chestnut and sorrel are two distinct colorations, but there is no known genetic difference between the two and no clear consensus on what the distinction is. Some argue that \"sorrel\" should be used to describe only lighter shades, or shades with a very clear reddish tint, while \"chestnut\" denotes darker shades or shades with more brown in them. The American Quarter Horse Association, which uses both terms, describes a sorrel as a type of copper-red chestnut, but allows that chestnut is also a correct term. \n\nIn terms of equine coat color genetics there is no difference at all. Solid reddish-brown color is a base color of horses, caused by the recessive \"e\" gene.\n\nSorrel or chestnut coloration can be distinguished from dun by the fact that a dun horse has a gene that causes slightly washed-out yellowish color, with a darker mane and tail than the rest of its coat, may have areas of darker color on the shoulder and forelegs, and also possesses a narrow, dark line down the middle of the back.\n\nA sorrel and a bay, especially a \"blood bay,\" may be confused with one another. However, all bays have \"black points\" - a black mane, tail and lower legs. Light-colored sorrels, sometimes called \"blond sorrels,\" especially if they have flaxen manes and tails, may resemble a palomino. However, true palomino coloration is the result of a horse's being heterozygous for the cream dilution gene. \n\nSome definitions list sorrel as a self color, used to describe only horses whose mane, tail, and legs are the same color as the rest of the coat, with the exception of white markings. Other definitions are broader and include reddish-brown horses with flaxen manes and tails.\n\nMore often than not, the practical difference is usually not in color, but in usage: horses ridden in the Western tradition are more often referred to as sorrel and horses ridden in the English tradition are chestnut. Many organizations simply avoid the whole fuss and choose one of the two terms to denote all reddish or brown colorations that are not bay.\n\n"}

When sauerkraut is used instead, the soup is called sour shchi, while soups based on sorrel, spinach, nettle, and similar plants are called green shchi (, \"zelyoniye shchi\"). In the past, the term \"sour shchi\" was also used to refer to a drink, a variation of kvass, which was unrelated to the soup.\n\nShchi is a traditional soup of Russia where it has been known as far back as the 9th century, soon after cabbage was introduced from Byzantium. Its popularity in Russia originates from several factors. Shchi is relatively easy to prepare; it can be cooked with or without various types of meat; and it can be frozen and carried as a solid on a trip to be cut up when needed. As a result, by the 10th century shchi became a staple food of Russia, and a popular saying sprang from this fact: \"Щи да каша — пища наша.\" (\"Shchi da kasha — pishcha nasha\" \"Shchi and kasha are our food\"). The major components of shchi were originally cabbage, meat (beef, pork, lamb, or poultry), mushrooms, flour, and spices (based on onion and garlic). Cabbage and meat were cooked separately and smetana was added as a garnish before serving. Shchi is traditionally eaten with rye bread.\n\nThe ingredients of shchi gradually changed. Flour, which was added in early times to increase the soup's caloric value, was excluded for the sake of finer taste. The spice mixture was enriched with black pepper and bay leaf, which were imported to Russia around the 15th century, also from Byzantium. Meat was sometimes substituted with fish, while carrot and parsley could be added to the vegetables. Beef was the most popular meat for shchi in Russia, while pork was more common in Ukraine. The water-to-cabbage ratio varied and whereas early shchi were often so viscous that a spoon could stand in it, more diluted preparation was adopted later.\n\nThe two-letter word щи contains the letter щ, which is absent in most non-Cyrillic alphabets and is transcribed into them with several letters. In German, щи becomes eight letters, \"Schtschi\".\n"}

Preparing the food for the banquet of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, Spry proposed the recipe of cold chicken, curry cream sauce and dressing that would later become known as coronation chicken.\n\nCoronation chicken may have been inspired by jubilee chicken, a dish prepared for the silver jubilee of George V in 1935, which mixed chicken with mayonnaise and curry.

The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the \"tail\". The smaller, pointed end—the \"tail\"—starts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the \"sirloin\" \"primal cut\", which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the tenderest part of the beef.\n\nWhole tenderloins are sold as either \"unpeeled\" (meaning the fat and silver skin remain), \"peeled\" (meaning that the fat is removed, but silver skin remains), or as PSMOs (\"pismos\"), which is short for peeled, silver skin removed, and side muscle (the \"chain\") left on. While the most expensive option pound-for-pound, PSMOs offer considerable savings over other tenderloin options as they require little handling by the chef, since the fat and trimmings have already been removed. Since it is the tenderest part of the animal, beef dishes requiring exceptionally tender meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin.\n\nThe three main \"cuts\" of the tenderloin are the butt, the center-cut, and the tail. The butt end is usually suitable for carpaccio, as the eye can be quite large; cutting a whole tenderloin into steaks of equal weight will yield proportionally very thin steaks from the butt end. The center-cut is suitable for portion-controlled steaks, as the diameter of the eye remains relatively consistent. The center-cut can yield the traditional filet mignon or tenderloin steak, as well as the Chateaubriand steak and beef Wellington. The tail, which is generally unsuitable for steaks due to size inconsistency, can be used in recipes where small pieces of a tender cut are called for, such as beef Stroganoff.\n"}

In the RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a television or computer screen, azure is created by adding a little green light to blue light. The complementary color of azure is orange.\n\nIn the X11 color system which became a standard for early web colors, azure is depicted as a pale cyan or white cyan.\n\nThe color azure ultimately takes its name from the intense blue mineral lapis lazuli.

In order to preserve its deep color, azurite was ground coarsely. Fine-ground azurite produces a lighter, washed-out color. Traditionally, the pigment was considered unstable in oil paints, and was sometimes isolated from other colors and not mixed. \n\nThe use of the term spread through the practice of heraldry, where \"azure\" represents a blue color in the system of tinctures. In engravings, it is represented as a region of parallel horizontal lines, or by the abbreviation \"az.\" or \"b.\" In practice, azure has been represented by any number of shades of blue. In later heraldic practice a lighter blue, called bleu celeste (\"sky blue\"), is sometimes specified.\n\nAccording to the logic of the , indigo colors are those colors with hue codes between 255 and 225 (degrees), azure colors are those colors with hue codes between 195 and 225, and cyan colors are those colors with hue codes between 165 and 195.

Water polo balls come in two main sizes: a size 5 (68-71 cm in circumference), intended for use by men, and a size 4 (65-67 cm in circumference), intended for women. Smaller balls are sometimes used by juniors for \"mini-polo,\" though these miniature balls do not typically come in standard sizes and are often coloured green.\n\nThe modern game originated in the late 19th century as a form of rugby football, played in rivers in England and Scotland, with a small 3 to 4 inch ball constructed of rubber imported from colonial plantations in India. This \"water rugby\" came to be called \"water polo\" based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, \"pulu\". The original ball soon gave way to a football (soccer ball), which allowed for passing and swimming above water with the ball. However, the leather football absorbed water and became extremely heavy, slippery and out-of-control when wet. In 1936, James R. (\"Jimmy\") Smith, California water polo coach and author of several books on water polo mechanics, developed a ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. The new ball was red, but by 1948 yellow was adopted for better visibility by players.

The current rule states that the water polo ball must be “yellow with black lines,” but new wording will allow for colored panels.

Not all masters carry the honorary title; it must be either officially bestowed by royalty (similar to a knighthood) or unofficially by commonfolk. The latter is most common today, especially outside Southeast Asia. In modern usage, the title is often adopted by the founder of a new style and is used much like the term grandmaster.\n\nA theory says that it is a compound of the Malay words \"pandai\", meaning clever or skilled, and \"akar\" meaning root. It may be related to the Kawi terms \"upakara\" which means teacher, and \"kekarepan\" which means ethos or ambition. A variant of pendekar is the word \"pakar\" which can mean any kind of expert.\n\nA genuine silat guru must have mastered every aspect of the art. These are the forms and techniques, their combat application, internal methods and traditional medicine. Therefore, a pendekar must be more than merely an instructor or expert, she/he must be a fighter, a traditional doctor, and a receptacle of their discipline's culture and wisdom. The emphasis given to each of these varies from one style to another. Some systems are more sport-oriented while others focus on spiritual development. Traditional masters, however, only consider a style to be \"true silat\" if it can be used in battle. Every movement is deliberate and has its function in a fight.\n\nMeditation and internal training serves as a counterbalance for a warrior's martial skills. In northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, this balance is symbolised by the concept of \"jantan betina\" (male-female), equivalent to the Chinese yin and yang. In Indo-Malay folklore, esoteric knowledge is only gained by fasting and then meditating under a tree. Silat practitioners of the past would meditate and fast at length, often in such locations as caves, jungles and even graveyards so they would not fear death. With this mentality, a pendekar is always prepared for combat, whether they are unarmed or outnumbered. This is encapsulated in the Malay saying \"From the tips of the hair to the tips of the toes\" (\"Dari hujung rambut ke hujung kaki\") meaning that all are potential weapons to be used at the right moment.\n\nPurportedly, a pendekar of the highest skill needs no weapon aside from their mind to subdue the opponent. By focusing their energy, masters were said to be able to attack an opponent without physically touching them, strike a vital point from afar, or stop someone's heart without them noticing they've been hurt. Silat folklore is replete with tales of fighters possessing such skills as the ability to run very rapidly, vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear, change form, dash across the surface of water, turn invisible, or leap to the roof of a house.\n\nFinally, a pendekar must be familiar with traditional healing methods. Massage is commonly taught alongside silat because of its relation to \"sentuhan\" or the art of striking pressure points. Sentuhan could also be applied to other aspects of healing such as stopping a wound from bleeding or stimulating energy flow. Some masters might also have knowledge of herbalism or bone-setting. It was once considered necessary for anyone teaching silat to be able to nurse injured students back to health.\n\n\nhttps://www.kunosilat.com/terminology\n"}

But when he continues the practice without remission and is spellbound, the effect begins to be that he melts and liquefies till he completely dissolves away his spirit, cuts out as it were the very sinews of his soul and makes of himself a 'feeble warrior'.\"\n\nAristotle writes that, \"of the dispositions described above, the deliberate avoidance of pain is rather a kind of softness (\"malakia\"); the deliberate pursuit of pleasure is profligacy in the strict sense.\"; \"One who is deficient in resistance to pains that most men withstand with success, is soft (\"malakos\") or luxurious, for luxury is a kind of softness (\"malakia\"); such a man lets his cloak trail on the ground to escape the fatigue and trouble of lifting it, or feigns sickness, not seeing that to counterfeit misery is to be miserable.\" and \"People too fond of amusement are thought to be profligate, but really they are soft (\"malakos\"); for amusement is rest, and therefore a slackening of effort, and addiction to amusement is a form of excessive slackness.\"\n\nA writer of the Peripatetic school (c. 1st century BC or AD) elaborated a little more on Aristotle by labeling softness as a vice. He writes that \"Cowardice is accompanied by softness (\"malakia\"), unmanliness, faint-heartedness.\" It was also a concomitant of uncontrol: \"The concomitants of uncontrol are softness (\"malakia\") and negligence.\"\n\nEarly editions of the Liddell and Scott \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" gave \"delicacy, effeminacy\" as a translation of μαλακία in passages such as Herodotus 6,11 and Thucydides 1,122. Since the 20th-century revision by Jones, the same work now gives \"moral weakness\" as the meaning of the word in the same passages.\n\nIn a passage of the famous Funeral Oration that Thucydides placed in his mouth, Pericles is translated by Crawley as saying that the Athenians \"cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy (\"malakia\")\".\n\nOlder Bible translations used \"effeminate\" to translate \"malakoi\" in I Corinthians.\n\nIn the gospels, the only instance of the word (in the adjectival form) is in Matthew and Luke, who use \"malakos\" to refer to luxurious clothing, in contrast to the attire of John the Baptist: \"What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft (\"malakos\") clothing?\" In this context, the word is translated as \"soft\", \"fine\", \"delicate\", \"expensive\", \"fancy\".\n\nPaul's First Letter to the Corinthians uses \"malakos\" in the plural to refer to persons. This is commonly translated as \"effeminate\", as in the King James Version, which has: \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor \"effeminate\", nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" Another common translation is \"male prostitutes\". Other versions have: \"passive homosexual partners\", \"men who are prostitutes\", \"effeminate call boys\", \"men who let other men use them for sex\", \"those who make women of themselves\".\n\nIn Question 138 of the Second Part of the Second Part of his Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas delves more deeply into the connotations of the Latin word \"mollities\", used to translate the word \"malakia\" used by Aristotle (whom Aquinas calls \"the Philosopher\") in his \"Nicomachean Ethics\" (Book VII, 7), and which is this English translation is rendered by \"effeminacy\".\n\nWhether effeminacy [\"mollities\", literally \"softness\"] is opposed to perseverance?\n\n\"Objection 1.\" It seems that effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance. For a gloss on 1 Cor. 6:9,10, \"Nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind,\" expounds the text thus: \"Effeminate—i.e. obscene, given to unnatural vice.\" But this is opposed to chastity. Therefore, effeminacy is not a vice opposed to perseverance.\n\n\"Objection 2.\" Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \"delicacy is a kind of effeminacy.\" But to be delicate seems akin to intemperance. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance but to temperance.\n\n\"Objection 3.\" Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \"the man who is fond of amusement is effeminate.\" Now immoderate fondness of amusement is opposed to eutrapelia, which is the virtue about pleasures of play, as stated in Ethic. iv, 8. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" The Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \"the persevering man is opposed to the effeminate.\"\n\n\"I answer that,\" As stated above (137, 1 and 2), perseverance is deserving of praise because thereby a man does not forsake a good on account of long endurance of difficulties and toils: and it is directly opposed to this, seemingly, for a man to be ready to forsake a good on account of difficulties which he cannot endure. This is what we understand by effeminacy, because a thing is said to be \"soft\" if it readily yields to the touch. Now a thing is not declared to be soft through yielding to a heavy blow, for walls yield to the battering-ram. Wherefore a man is not said to be effeminate if he yields to heavy blows. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \"it is no wonder, if a person is overcome by strong and overwhelming pleasures or sorrows; but he is to be pardoned if he struggles against them.\" Now it is evident that fear of danger is more impelling than the desire of pleasure: wherefore Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading \"True magnanimity consists of two things: It is inconsistent for one who is not cast down by fear, to be defeated by lust, or who has proved himself unbeaten by toil, to yield to pleasure.\" Moreover, pleasure itself is a stronger motive of attraction than sorrow, for the lack of pleasure is a motive of withdrawal, since lack of pleasure is a pure privation. Wherefore, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 7), properly speaking an effeminate man is one who withdraws from good on account of sorrow caused by lack of pleasure, yielding as it were to a weak motion.\n\n\"Reply to Objection 1.\" This effeminacy is caused in two ways. On one way, by custom: for where a man is accustomed to enjoy pleasures, it is more difficult for him to endure the lack of them. On another way, by natural disposition, because, to wit, his mind is less persevering through the frailty of his temperament. This is how women are compared to men, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7): wherefore those who are passively sodomitical are said to be effeminate, being womanish themselves, as it were.\n\n\"Reply to Objection 2.\" Toil is opposed to bodily pleasure: wherefore it is only toilsome things that are a hindrance to pleasures. Now the delicate are those who cannot endure toils, nor anything that diminishes pleasure. Hence it is written (Dt. 28:56): \"The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the ground, nor set down her foot for… softness [Douay: 'niceness'].\" Thus delicacy is a kind of effeminacy. But properly speaking effeminacy regards lack of pleasures, while delicacy regards the cause that hinders pleasure, for instance toil or the like.\n\n\"Reply to Objection 3.\" In play two things may be considered. On the first place there is the pleasure, and thus inordinate fondness of play is opposed to eutrapelia. Secondly, we may consider the relaxation or rest which is opposed to toil. Accordingly, just as it belongs to effeminacy to be unable to endure toilsome things, so too it belongs thereto to desire play or any other relaxation inordinately.\n\nLatin writers adopted the Greek word, Latinized as \"malacia\", to mean, literally or figuratively, \"a calm at sea\", \"dead calm\", or to mean \"a total want of appetite\", \"nausea\".\n\nIn English, the word \"malacia\" is used in medicine to mean an abnormal craving for certain kinds of food, and in pathology to mean an abnormal softening of organs or tissues of the human body.\n\nIn modern Greek, the word μαλακία – \"malakia\" has come to mean \"masturbation\", and its derivative μαλάκας – \"malakas\" means \"one who masturbates\". Depending on the tone of voice, this term can be used colloquially as a friendly greeting or in a derogatory sense when angry. This word is very common in modern Greece.\n\nHerodotus recounted that, when the Persian king Cyrus the Great asked Croesus, a defeated king who was now his counsellor, what he should do in view of a revolt of the Lydians, Croesus advised him to punish the leader, \"but let the Lydians be pardoned; and lay on them this command, that they may not revolt or be dangerous to you; then, I say, and forbid them to possess weapons of war, and command them to wear tunics under their cloaks and buskins on their feet, and to teach their sons lyre-playing and song and dance and huckstering. Then, O King, you will soon see them turned to women instead of men; and thus you need not fear lest they revolt.\" Note that the word \"malakia\" is not used in the Greek original of this text.\n\nThe Greek idea that those engaged in mechanical trades incurred effeminacy was expressed by Xenophon (the word translated here as \"effeminate\" is unrelated to \"malakia\"):\nMen do indeed speak ill of those occupations which are called handicrafts, and they are rightly held of little repute in communities, because they weaken the bodies of those who make their living at them by compelling them to sit and pass their days indoors. Some indeed work all the time by a fire. But when the body becomes effeminate (\"thelunomenos\") the mind too is debilitated. Besides, these mechanical occupations (\"banausos\") leave a man no leisure to attend to his friends' interests, or the public interest. This class therefore cannot be of much use to his friends or defend his country. Indeed, some states, especially the most warlike, do not allow a citizen to engage in these handicraft occupations.\n\n"}

The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (\"pav\") sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chilli pepper. It originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, but is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.\n\n\"Vada\" comes from the Marathi compound word \"batata vada\", which means \"potato fritter\". \"Pav\" is a derivative of the Portuguese word \"pão\", which means bread.\n\nBoiled potato is mashed and mixed with spices, usually with green chilli, garlic, asafoetida, turmeric, and mustard seeds. The mass is then coated in gram flour batter and deep fried. The resultant fritter is served in a bread bun, accompanied by one or more chutneys and fried green chilli.\n\nThe most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai, then known as \"Bombay\". The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. The combination of the potato dumpling (\"batata vada\") placed inside a \"pav\" quickly became popular in Girangaon and later the rest of Mumbai. Despite the ethnocentrism in Maharashtra, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Marathis despite the concept of a sandwich (a filling of potato within slices of bread) being western.\n\nOne of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be \"Khidki Vada Pav\" located in Kalyan. It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pav from a \"khidki\" (the Marathi word for \"window\") of their house facing the road.\n\n"}

It is made of puffed rice, vegetables and a tangy tamarind sauce.\n\nBhel is often identified with the beaches of Mumbai, such as Chowpatty or Juhu. One theory for its origin is that it was invented at a restaurant called Vithal near Victoria Terminus. According to another theory, bhelpuri was contributed by the city's Gujaratis, who made it by adding complex flavours to the simple North Indian chaat. Gujarati housewives began making it, and invented several varieties like the pakodi puri, and as it spread many different communities like the Mangaloreans and Sindhis made their own versions.\n\nThe recipe has spread to most parts of India where it has been modified to suit local food availability. Dry bhel is made from bhadang, a spicy namkeen from Western Maharashtra, and is consumed after garnishing with onions, coriander and lemon juice. The Bengali variant of bhelpuri is called \"jhalmuri\" (meaning \"spicy puffed rice\"). A native Mysore variant of bhelpuri is known as \"churumuri\" or \"churmuri\" in Mangalore.\n\nThere is no clear mention of when and where bhelpuri was first prepared, but it likely originated in cafes and street food stalls of Mumbai. Bhelpuri belongs to the family of chaats, which are salty and spicy snacks sold on carts throughout India.\n\nBhelpuri is made from puffed rice and sev (a fried snack shaped like thin noodles made from besan flour) mixed with potatoes, onions, chat masala and chutney and a mixture of other fried snacks as the base of the snack. Bhelpuri has a balance of sweet, salty, tart and spicy flavors, with different textures as well, including crispy and crunchy from the puffed rice and fried sev. Other commonly used ingredients include tomatoes and chilis added to the base. In northern India recipes also include boiled potatoes cut into small pieces.\n\nDifferent chutneys impart a sweet, tangy or spicy flavour. There are two popular chutneys used: a dark brown sweet one made mainly from dates and tamarind (\"saunth\" chutney) and a green spicy chutney made from coriander, mint leaves and green chillies.\n\nBhelpuri is also made by sprinkling the puffed rice mixture with chunks of diced raw sweet mango. The finished snack is often garnished with a combination of diced onions, coriander leaves and chopped green chilies. It is sometimes served with papri puris, a deep-fried small round and crispy wheat bread.\n\nOther variants of bhelpuri:\n\nBhel puri can be served in many ways, but it is usually served in a paper folded in the form of a cone and is consumed using a paper spoon or by the papdi which is itself an edible component of the bhel puri or it is put on a plate.\n\n"}

The candy was introduced in 1977, and introduced to Canada in 1980. \n\nThe then relatively new product became very popular with the 1982 release of \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", in which the candy is featured.\n\nThese are also sold in the UK, but still manufactured in the US. They contain genetically modified sugar beets, corn, and soya beans. \n\nReese's Pieces are a product extension of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups line; this new product was designed to capitalize on the success of the chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, though unlike the cups, they have no chocolate.\n\nThe candies were first manufactured using panning machines that had been used to make Hershey-ets, a chocolate-filled candy that had been discontinued. Designers knew that they wanted a peanut-flavored candy but had some problems with the filling. Original plans called for filling the candy shells with peanut butter, but the oil leaked out into the shell, leaving it soft, rather than crunchy. \n\nThe developer of the project turned the problem over to a team of outside scientists, who created a peanut-flavored penuche filling. More experimentation was needed to determine the correct thickness of the shell. Finally, the colors of the candy coating were designed to coordinate with the color of the Reese's package. The goal color distribution is 50% orange, 25% brown, and 25% yellow.\n\nIn 1982, the Mars candy bar company rejected an offer for the inclusion of its key product M&M's in the Steven Spielberg movie, \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\".

However, no contemporary account exists to support this claim, and the name was not used until some years after the Alaska Purchase. Delmonico's chef Charles Ranhofer called the dish an \"Alaska, Florida\" in 1894, apparently referring to the contrast between its cold and hot elements. The dish is also known as an \"omelette à la norvégienne\" or \"Norwegian omelette\", which similarly refers to the cold climate of Norway.\n\nThe dish is made of ice cream placed in a pie dish lined with slices of sponge cake or Christmas pudding, and topped with meringue. The entire dessert is then placed in an extremely hot oven for a brief time, long enough to firm and caramelize the meringue.\n\nIn 1969, the recently invented microwave oven enabled Hungarian gastrophysicist Nicholas Kurti to produce a reverse baked Alaska (also called a \"Frozen Florida\")—a frozen shell of meringue filled with hot liquor.\n\nA variation called bombe Alaska calls for some dark rum to be splashed over the baked Alaska. The whole dessert is flambéed while being served.\n\nFlame on the iceberg is a popular dessert in Hong Kong that is similar to baked Alaska. The dessert is an ice-cream ball in the middle of a sponge cake, with cream on the top. Whisky and syrup are poured over the top and the ball set alight before serving. Decades ago, the delicacy was served only in high-end hotels, but today it is commonly served in many Western restaurants and even in some \"cha chaan teng\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "872876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872876", "title": "Kulfi", "text": "Kulfi\n\nKulfi or Qulfi is a popular frozen dairy dessert originating from the Indian subcontinent during Mughal India. It is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\" It is popular throughout India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), and the Middle East, and widely available in restaurants serving cuisines from the Indian subcontinent around the world.\n\nKulfi has similarities to ice cream in appearance and taste; however it is denser and creamier. It comes in various flavours. The more traditional ones are cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (\"elaichi\"), saffron (\"kesar\" or \"zafran\"), and pistachio. There are newer variations such as apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, and avocado. Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, resulting in a solid, dense frozen dessert similar to traditional custard-based ice cream. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert. Due to its density, kulfi takes a longer time to melt than Western ice cream.\n\n\"Kulfi\" or \"Qulfi\" is a Hindustani word derived from the Persian \"Qufli\" meaning \"covered cup\", which in turn is of Arabic origin. The dessert likely originated in the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in the sweet dishes in the Indian subcontinent. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of Kulfi. \"Ain-i-Akbari\", a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar's administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas.\n\nKulfi is traditionally prepared by evaporating sweetened and flavoured milk via slow cooking, with almost continuous stirring to keep milk from sticking to the bottom of the vessel where it might burn, until its volume is reduced by a half, thus thickening it, increasing its fat, protein, and lactose density. It has a distinctive taste due to caramelization of lactose and sugar during the lengthy cooking process. The semi-condensed mix is then frozen in tight sealed moulds (often kulhars with their mouths sealed) that are then submerged in ice mixed with salt to speed up the freezing process. The ice/salt mix, along with its submerged kulfi moulds, is placed in a matka or an earthen pot that provides insulation from the external heat and slows down the melting of ice. Kulfi prepared in this manner is hence called \"Matka Kulfi\". Kulfi, thus prepared by slow freezing, also renders a unique smooth mouth feel that is devoid of ice crystals.\n\nAn easier version is to boil the milk and add bread crumbs, mawa (dried whole milk), and sugar while stirring. The cream layer formed on the boiling milk is scooped initially and added in the end to thicken the milk. More recently Kulfi is prepared from evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and heavy (double) cream. Then sugar is added and the mixture is further boiled and cornstarch-water paste is added. This paste thickens the mixture, although it is boiled for an additional few minutes. Then flavourings, dried fruits, cardamom, etc. are added. The mixture is then cooled, put in moulds and frozen. If frozen in individual-portion custard bowls for service with a spoon, bowls are removed from the freezer 10–15 minutes before serving to allow for melting at the edges.\n\nIt is garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachio nuts. Kulfi is also served with faloodeh (vermicelli noodles made from starch). In some places, people make it at home and make their own flavors. According to Vincent McMahon, T. E. Lawrence was known to have added grapefruit and pig's blood to his personal batch.\n\nIn India, kulfi is sold by vendors called \"kulfiwalas\", who keep the kulfi frozen by placing the moulds inside a large earthenware pot called a \"matka\", filled with ice and salt. It is served on a leaf or frozen onto a stick. It is the traditional sweet from the Indian subcontinent.\n"}

Borrowing the word \"Fresca\" (meaning \"fresh\") from Spanish, it was first introduced in the United States in 1966.\n\nSince introduction in 1966, Fresca has been marketed in the United States as a calorie-free, lime and grapefruit-flavored soft drink. Fresca has undergone several major ingredient changes since its introduction. It was originally sweetened with cyclamates, which were banned by the FDA in 1969, and replaced with saccharin. That was replaced by NutraSweet-brand aspartame. Around the time of the 2005 redesign, acesulfame potassium was added as a secondary sweetener.\nIn Latin America, Coca-Cola markets a sugar sweetened version of Fresca. In 1997, The Coca-Cola Company responded to requests for this product from immigrant communities by launching it throughout the U.S. as Citra. This was a success but is instead sold as the Citrus flavor in Coca-Cola's Fanta line in areas with large Hispanic populations. In Colombia and Argentina sweetened Fresca is called Quatro and marketed using Fresca's colors and logos.\nFresca was made available in South Africa during the early 1990s with a series of colorful ads featuring British-Nigerian actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim with the slogan, \"Nothing tastes like Fresca.\" The soft drink developed a cult following but sales were discontinued.\n\nFresca packaging has been redesigned several times, although advertising continues to emphasize sophistication. In 2005, Coca-Cola gave Fresca a more contemporary look, Fresca's first makeover since 1995. During this redesign, two new flavors were introduced (\"Sparkling Peach Citrus\" and \"Sparkling Black Cherry Citrus\") and the original grapefruit flavor was renamed \"Sparkling Citrus\". Later, \"Sparkling\" was dropped and the original flavor was renamed \"Original Citrus\". Several additional flavors have been added to the line-up since 2005, although those do not seem to have survived.\n\nCoca-Cola announced revamped packaging again in 2018 along with a new marketing campaign targeted towards Millenials - the first Fresca advertising since 2008 - with the stated intention of \"reeling in a new generation of drinkers unfamiliar with the brand\".\n\nAccording to Coca-Cola, the following flavors of Fresca are marketed today:\n\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada):\nNorth America (Mexico):\n\nU.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who loved the beverage, had control boxes installed in his White House offices. Typically, the control boxes were equipped with two buzzers to page his secretary and Chief of Staff, and\ntwo buttons to page the military valet who was stationed in a small office next to the Oval Office. The valet would bring him either a Fresca soft drink or coffee, depending on which button the President pushed.\n\nFresca was the favorite beverage of American actor John Hillerman, best known for his role as Higgins in the television series ‘’Magnum, P.I.’’ In paying tribute after the actor's passing, co-star Tom Selleck mentioned that his off-screen image of Hillerman was of the actor sitting in a director’s chair with a cigarette in a long cigarette holder, drinking a Fresca (which Hillerman always seemed to have on hand).\n\n\n"}

The Book of Mormon states that the Liahona also contained periodic written instructions from God. According to some sources, the Liahona was among the Book of Mormon artifacts Joseph Smith said were found with the golden plates.\n\nIn the Book of Mormon, the Liahona was found one morning at Lehi's tent door. It is described as a round brass ball of \"curious workmanship\" with \"two spindles,\" one of which indicated the direction that his party should travel (). It is sometimes referred to as a compass, although the context makes it clear that it did not function like a magnetic compass. On occasion there was also writing on the ball that displayed additional instructions from God (). Using the Liahona, Lehi and his party were directed through the wilderness and across the ocean to the Americas. The Liahona worked \"according to the faith and diligence\" () with which they heeded its direction, and ceased functioning at times when the members of the party demonstrated a loss of faith in God's commandments, notably when Nephi's brothers rebelled against Lehi during their ocean crossing ().\n\nThe only place in the Book of Mormon where the word \"Liahona\" is used is in the Book of Alma, when Alma, speaking to his son Helaman, explains \"our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass\" (). Alma tells his son that \"it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ ... to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass ... to the promised land\" ().\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, the word \"Liahona\" means \"a compass\" (). Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley also provided two additional possibilities for the meaning based on perceived Hebrew roots. He attributed the theory that it refers to a \"queen bee\" to a Hebrew University scholar named Shunary, and added his own speculation that \"Liyahhona\" might be translated \"To God is the guidance.\" \n\nJonathan Curci suggested that the word means \"the direction of the Lord\".\n\n"}

Common vegetables to stuff include tomato, pepper, onion, zucchini, eggplant, garlic. Cabbage rolls and dishes of stuffed grape leaves are also very popular, and these are sometimes also called \"sarma\". Meat dolmas are generally served warm, often with tahini or egg-lemon sauce. Dolmas prepared with olive oil and stuffed with rice are generally served cold with a garlic-yogurt sauce. Stuffed vegetables are also common in Greek cuisine, called \"gemista\", as well as in Italian cuisine, where they are named \"ripieni\" (\"stuffed\").\n\nIn 2017, dolma making in Azerbaijan was included into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The tradition is present throughout the Republic of Azerbaijan, and is perceived as a central culinary practice in all of its regions.\n\nThe word \"dolma\" is of Turkish origin from the word \"dolmak\" (to fill). \nThe plural form in Greek is \"dolmades\" and this is sometimes preferred in English usage instead of \"dolmas\".\n\nThe origins of dolma are unknown, but the dish is found in the cuisines of the Turkic countries, the Balkans, South Caucasus, Iran, Central Asia, Egypt, Arabia, and the Middle East. The word varies between Turkic dialects called \"dolama\" in Turkmen and \"tulma\" in the Tatar language. The word dolma most likely comes from Ottoman palace cuisine, but stuffed vegetables have other names as well like \"yemistos\" in Greek and \"mahshi\" in Arabic.\n\nDolma have been a part of Middle Eastern cuisine for centuries. Though the word \"dolma\" itself most likely has its roots in the cuisine of the Ottoman Topkapı Palace, stuffed vegetables are attested to in pre-Ottoman Arabic cookbooks that include recipes like eggplants stuffed with meat. Likewise, in Ancient Greece, fig leaf stuffed with sweetened cheese was called \"thrion\".\n\nThe exact origins are unknown, but the Persian variety has been traced to at least the 17th century and in the 19th century Naser al-Din Shah Qajars chef records several varieties including stuffed grape leaves, cabbage leaves, cucumbers, eggplants, apples, and quinces. The recorded stuffings included ground meat, sauteed mint, rice and saffron.\n\nDolma is a common dish in Iraqi cuisine, which includes a version of stuffed cabbage leaves, onions in aubergines cooked in tomato sauce. Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, Iraqis and Iranians have been making stuffed grape leaves for centuries. Over time, regional variations developed. In the Persian Gulf, basmati rice is preferred, and the flavor of the stuffing may be enhanced using tomatoes, onions and cumin. Muslim families often serve dolma as part of the \"iftar\" meal during Ramadan and during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the holy month. Assyrians prepare meatless dolmas for Lent. Large pots of dolma are prepared during the Norouz festival.\nDolma are part of cuisine of the Sephardic Jews as well. There are some variations in Jewish family dishes that are not found in other versions. Iraqi Jewish families had a version of dolma with sweet and sour flavors that were not found in other versions. During winter months cabbage was a staple food for peasants in Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and it spread to the Balkans as well. Jews in the Ottoman Empire used locally grown grape leaves and adopted the Turkish names of the dish. Jews in Eastern Europe prepared variations of stuffed cabbage rolls with kosher meat—this dish is called \"golubtsy\" in Russian, \"holubtsi\" in Ukrainian, \"gołąbki\" in Polish and \"holishkes\" or \"teibel\" in Yiddish. As meat was expensive, rice was sometimes mixed in with the meat. Jews in Europe would sometimes substitute barley, bread or kasha for the rice.\n\nThere are many varieties of the \"zeytinyağlı\" (with olive oil) and \"sağyağlı\" (with clarified butter) \"dolmas\". The \"zeytinyağlı\" dolmas are usually stuffed with rice and served cold, but variations with meat based fillings are served warm.\n\nThe origins of stuffed vine leaves are unknown, but the dish was popular throughout the Ottoman Empire and can be found in many regional cuisines today. Sephardim call them \"yaprakes finos\", and they are known as \"dolma bargh\" in Iran, \"dolmades\" in Greece, \"yalanchi sarma\" in Armenia, and \"yerba\" in Syria. Some Israelis may use leaves picked from the local mulberry trees.\nStuffed vine leaves without meat are sometimes called \"yalancı dolma\", which means \"liar's dolma\" in Turkish. \"Vişneli yalancı dolması\" is a variation of stuffed vine leaves where the rice is seasoned with cinnamon, allspice and mint. The dolmas are slowly cooked together with morello cherries (\"vişne\"), and plums may be used also. A modern Israeli recipe has a meat-filled variant served in a pomegranate sauce with dried cherries.\n\nIn Persian cuisine \"basuts dolma\" is a dish of cabbage rolls stuffed with beans and tart fruits. In Armenia, it is called Lenten Dolma or Pasuts Tolma (պասուց տոլմա). It is wrapped with cabbage leaves, and stuffed with red beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, cracked wheat, tomato paste, onion and many spices and flavorings. Pasuts tolma is made of seven different grains – chickpea, bean, lentil, cracked wheat, pea, rice and maize. All the grains are boiled. This dolma is called \"pasuts\" (fast day) because the Christian New Year features the fast days, which end on Easter day. Armenian cooks sometimes use rose hip syrup to flavor stuffed cabbage rolls. Some Jewish families eat stuffed cabbage on \"Simchat Torah\". There is a Turkish variation with a chestnut and rice based filling.\n\nEgyptians call this main course mahshi (also spelled mashi or mashy). It is stuffed vine leaves but traditionally, cabbage is used in the winter and vine leaves are used in the summer. According to Anthony Khatchaturian, a member of the Armenian community in Kolkata, India, the Bengali dish \"potoler dorma\" (stuffed gourd) was adapted from meat-stuffed vine leaves.\n\n\"Mülebbes dolma\" is a historic recipe from the Ottoman era. \"Halep dolması\"—named for Aleppo—is a dish of eggplants stuffed with a meat and rice filling that is flavored with spices and either sour plum flavoring syrup or lemon juice. \"Şalgam dolma\" are stuffed Russian turnips.\n\n\"Enginar dolması\" is stuffed whole artichoke hearts. They may be stuffed with seasoned rice or ground meat cooked in fresh tomato sauce with aleppo pepper. Celery root may be substituted for the artichoke.\n\nA regional specialty from Mardin is mixed dolma platter. The sumac and Urfa pepper seasoned rice filling is first wrapped with onion layers, vine leaves and cabbage. The remainder of the rice is used to fill eggplant, zucchini and stuffing peppers. The wrapped onion dolma are added on the bottom of a deep cooking pot and the stuffed vegetables, cabbage rolls and stuffed vine leaves are layered on top of the onion dolmas. The entire pot of dolmas are cooked in sumac flavored water.\n\nThere are also seafood variants of dolma. Stuffed mussels, called \"midye dolma\" are very popular in Turkey. Midye dolma may be filled with rice, onion, black pepper and pimento spice.\n\nThe filling for \"kalamar dolma\" (stuffed calamari) is made from Halloumi cheese, onion, fresh bread crumbs, garlic and parsley. The whole tentacle is stuffed with the mixture and fried in a butter, olive oil and tomato sauce. For another variation a whole small squid may be stuffed with a bulgur and fresh herb mixture and baked in the oven.\n\n\"Uskumru dolma\" (stuffed mackerel) is a staple of Istanbul cuisine. The version that was traditionally prepared by Armenian cooks is particularly well-regarded. After the fish is prepared by carefully separating the skin from the meat, the meat is sauteed with onions, currants, dried apricots, almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, ginger, fresh herbs and lemon juice. The entire mixture is stuffed into the whole, intact skin. The stuffed mackerel is then either baked or preferably grilled long enough to brown the skin.\n\nSardines (\"sardalya\") may be stuffed with a filling of kashar cheese, tomato, onion, dill and parsley. In Turkey, stuffed sardines may be served as a mezze platter at traditional taverns called \"meyhane\".\n\nThere are several varieties of dolma made with offal. \"Dalak dolması\", widely considered a delicacy of Armenian origin, is spleen stuffed with rice that has been seasoned with allspice, salt, pepper, mint, parsley and onion. It may be served an accompaniment with the anise-flavored liquor called \"rakı\".\n\n\"Mumbar dolma\" is intestine stuffed with a moist mixture of ground meat, rice, pepper, cumin and salt. The stuffed intestine is then boiled in water until it is cooked thoroughly, after which it may be sliced and fried in butter before serving.\n\nThere are some fruit-based dolmas as well like \"şekerli ayva dolması\" (stuffed quinces with a rice and currant filling, flavored with coriander, cinnamon and sugar) and \"pekmezli ayva dolması\" (meat and bulgur stuffed quince flavored with a traditional Turkish syrup, similar to molasses, called \"pekmez\"). \"Pekmez\" is also an ingredient in the meat-based variants of \"elma dolması\" (stuffed apples) and \"sarı erık dolması\" (stuffed yellow plums). Persian Jews may serve stuffed quince, called \"dolma bay\", as a Sabbath meal or during Sukkot.\n\nOne filling for stuffed apples is made from high-quality cubed lamb shoulder called \"kuşbaşı\", ground lamb and rice. First black grapes are boiled together with sumac—the resulting sumac flavored grape juice is drained and reserved. The \"kuşbaşı\" lamb is cooked in this sumac flavored grape juice. The apples are stuffed with a mixture of ground lamb combined with rice, salt, pepper and layered in a pot on top of the cooked chunks of \"kuşbaşı\". The apples are cooked in the remaining sumac flavored grape juice. Dried apricots and blanched almonds are added to the pot near the end of the cooking process. A meatless variant of the filling is made from a sauteed mixture of diced apples, diced pears, walnuts, hazelnut, currants, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise. The hollowed out apples are stuffed with the mixture and baked in the oven. This version may be garnished with powdered sugar.\n\n\n"}

It is thought that the vinegar was used as an emulsifier to keep the blood from clotting during the cooking process. The armies of Sparta mainly ate this; it was not a delicacy, but used for sustenance and strength.\n\nAccording to legend, a man from Sybaris, a city in southern Italy infamous for its luxury and gluttony (which gave rise to the word \"sybarite\"), after tasting the Spartans' black soup remarked with disgust, \"Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death\". In another story, it is said that Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, bought a slave who had been a Spartan cook and ordered him to prepare the broth for him, sparing no expense. When the king tasted it, he spat it out in disgust, whereupon the cook said, \"Your Majesty, it is necessary to have exercised in the Spartan manner, and to have bathed in the Eurotas, in order to relish this broth.\"\n\nNo recipe for the Spartan black soup has survived, but blood soups are still eaten in various countries today, such as Greece (particularly in Laconia), Italy, France and also Serbia.\n\n"}

The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits was at the court of Elizabeth I of England. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests.\n\nMost gingerbread men share a roughly humanoid shape, with stubby feet and no fingers. Many gingerbread men have a face, though whether the features are indentations within the face itself or other candies stuck on with icing or chocolate varies from recipe to recipe. Other decorations are common; hair, shirt cuffs, and shoes are sometimes applied, but by far the most popular decoration is shirt buttons, which are traditionally represented by gum drops, icing, or raisins.\n\nAccording to the \"Guinness Book of Records\", the world’s largest gingerbread man was made by the staff of the IKEA Furuset store in Oslo, Norway, on 9 November 2009.

{"id": "877704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=877704", "title": "Doner kebab", "text": "Doner kebab\n\nDoner kebab (also döner kebab) (, ; or ) is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The outer layer is sliced into thin shavings as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and doner kebab inspired similar dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, and Mexican al pastor.\n\nThe sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a pita or other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin flatbread such as lavash or yufka, known as a \"dürüm\" (literally meaning roll or wrap in Turkish). Since the early 1970s, the sandwich or wrap form has become popular around the world as a fast food dish sold by kebab shops, and is often called simply a \"kebab\". The sandwich generally contains salad or vegetables, which may include tomato, lettuce, cabbage, onion with sumac, fresh or pickled cucumber, or chili, and various types of sauces.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire at least as far back as the 17th century, stacks of seasoned sliced meat were cooked on a horizontal rotisserie, similar to the cağ kebab. The vertical rotisserie was introduced no later than the mid-19th century. The town of Bursa, in modern-day Turkey, is often considered the birthplace of the vertically-roasted döner kebab. According to Yavuz İskenderoğlu, his grandfather İskender Efendi as a child in 1850s Bursa had the idea of roasting the lamb at his father's restaurant vertically rather than horizontally; it was a success, and some years later became known as \"döner kebap\". However, he may have been preceded by Hamdi Usta from Kastamonu around 1830.\n\nIt was not until a century later that döner kebab was introduced and popularized in Istanbul, most famously by Beyti Güler. His restaurant, first opened in 1945, was soon discovered by journalists and began serving döner and other kebab dishes to kings, prime ministers, film stars and celebrities. It has been sold in sandwich form in Istanbul since at least the mid-1960s.\n\nThe döner kebab, and its derivatives shawarma and gyros, served in a sandwich, came to worldwide prominence in the mid to late 20th century. The first doner kebab shop in London opened in 1966, while Greek-style doner kebab, also known as gyros, was already popular in Greece and New York City in 1971.\n\nIn Germany, the döner kebab was popularized by Turkish guest workers in Berlin in the early 1970s. The dish developed there from its original form into a distinctive style of sandwich with abundant salad, vegetables, and sauces, sold in large portions at affordable prices, that would soon become one of the top-selling fast food and street food dishes in Germany and much of Europe, and popular around the world.\n\nIn the English name \"\", the word \"doner\" is borrowed from the Turkish , with the Turkish letter \"ö\" usually anglicized as \"o\", though \"döner kebab\" is an alternate spelling in English. The word \"\" is used, which comes to English from the (\"kabāb\"), partly through Urdu, Persian and Turkish; it may refer to a number of different kebab dishes made with roasted or grilled meat. While \"kebab\" has been used in English since the late 17th century, \"doner/döner kebab\" is known only from the mid-20th or later. The Turkish word ' comes from \"dönmek\" (\"to turn\" or \"to rotate\"), so the Turkish name literally means \"rotating roast\". In German, it is spelled \"Döner Kebab\", which can also be spelled \"Doener Kebab\" if the \"ö\" character is not available; the sandwich is often called \"ein Döner\". Particularly in British English, a döner kebab sandwich may be referred to simply as \"a kebab\". A Canadian variation is \"donair\". In Greek, it was originally called \"döner\" () but later came to be known as \"gyros\", from (\"turn\"), a calque of the Turkish name. The Arabic name (\"shāwarmā\") derives from another Turkish word, ', also meaning \"turning\". Persians refer to it as \"kebab torki\".\n\nThere are many variations of \"döner\" in Turkey:\n\nIn Azerbaijan, döner kebab (), served similarly to the European style of sandwich wrapped in ' (flatbread) or in ' (bread, including tandoor bread), is one of the most widespread fast foods. It is usually made with ' (meat, essentially lamb or mutton), but sometimes ' (chicken).\n\nIn Japan, döner kebabs are now common, especially in Tokyo. They are predominantly made of chicken but occasionally beef, and called simply \"kebab\". The toppings include shredded lettuce or cabbage, sliced tomato, and usually a choice of sauces such as Thousand Islands, spicy, and garlic.\n\nDöner kebab is increasingly becoming popular in Vietnam. Throughout Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City many döner kebab stalls can be found. Bánh mỳ Döner Kebab, the Vietnamese version of the döner kebab, has some fundamental differences with the original döner kebab. First of all, pork is used instead of beef and lamb. Second, the meat is served in a Vietnamese baguette. Thirdly, the meat is topped with sour vegetables and chili sauce.\n\nDöner kebab shops can be found in all cities across Austria. Kebabs (often referred to as \"Döner\") outsell burgers or the traditional Würstel (sausage).\n\nIn Finland, döner kebabs have gained a lot of popularity since Turkish immigrants opened restaurants and imported their traditional food. Kebabs are generally regarded as fast food, often served in late-night restaurants also serving pizza, as well as shopping malls. There are over 1000 currently active restaurants that serve kebab foods in Finland, making one kebab restaurant for every 5000 people in mainland Finland.\n\nA typical \"kebab\" consists of bread stuffed with döner meat shavings, lettuce, sliced tomato and onions, with a choice of sauce including sauce blanche, a mayo-yogurt sauce. Kebabs are usually served with french fries, often stuffed into the bread itself. In Paris, this variation is called \"Sandwich grec\" (\"Greek sandwich\").\n\nIn Germany, the earliest claim to the introduction of Turkish döner kebab dates to 1969, when Bursa native Nevzat Salim and his father started to sell the Iskender Kebap in Reutlingen. However, the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDID) connects the wide popularization of the dish to the stand of Turkish guest worker Kadir Nurman at West Berlin's Zoo Station in 1972, which helped establish the döner kebab sandwich as a fast food option. While the claims of multiple persons to have \"invented\" the döner may be hard to prove, the further development of döner kebab is connected to the city of Berlin.\n\nThe döner kebap as it was first served in Berlin contained only meat, onions and a bit of salad. Over time, it developed into a dish with abundant salad, vegetables, and a selection of sauces to choose from. Even orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word \"scharf\", flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of döner kebap. This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of döner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the döner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.\n\nAnnual sales of döner kebabs in Germany amounted to €2.5 billion in 2010. Beef or veal, and chicken, are widely used instead of the more expensive lamb. Turkey (\"Truthahn\") and vegetarian versions are becoming increasingly popular.\n\nTarkan Taşyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of döner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms. At the same ATDID fair, Taşyumruk stated that, \"Annual sales in Germany amount to €2.5 billion. That shows we are one of the biggest fast-foods in Germany.\" In many cities throughout Germany, döner kebabs are at least as popular as hamburgers or sausages, especially with young people.\n\nIn 2011 there were over 16,000 establishments selling döner kebabs in Germany, with yearly sales of €3.5 billion.\n\n\"Kapsalon\" is a Dutch food item consisting of French fries topped with döner or shawarma meat, garlic sauce, and a layer of Gouda cheese, baked or broiled until melted, and then subsequently covered with a layer of dressed salad greens and more sauce. The dish is usually served as fast food in a disposable metal tray. The term \"kapsalon\" means \"hairdressing salon\" or \"barbershop\" in Dutch, alluding to hairdresser Nathaniel Gomes who originated the dish when he requested his local kebab shop in Rotterdam to prepare it for him.\n\nIntroduced by Turkish immigrants, the döner kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom, especially after a night out.\n\nA variation known as \"donair\" was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the early 1970s. There are competing claims about the origin, but according to Halifax resident Leo Gamoulakos, his father, Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos, started selling Greek-style gyros at Velos Pizza in the Halifax suburb of Bedford. It did not catch on with the public, so in 1972 he modified the customary pork and lamb recipe by using spiced ground beef, Lebanese flatbread, and inventing the distinctive sweet \"donair sauce\" made with condensed milk, vinegar, sugar, and garlic. He called it by the \"doner\" name rather than \"gyros\", but it came to be pronounced, and spelled, as \"donair\". Gamoulakos in 1973 opened the first \"King of Donair\" restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax. In 2015, Halifax named donair the city's official food. Historically found only in Atlantic Canada, the dishes popularity has expanded throughout Canada.\n\nAl pastor is a variation of döner kebab via Lebanese shawarma. Literally \"\"in the style of the shepherd\"\", it references the lamb often used in shawarma, though it is normally made with pork.\n\nThere is evidence of Greek restaurants serving doner kebab by the original name, as well as by \"gyros\", in the early 1970s. It was also available, possibly later, in some Turkish restaurants. In recent years a number of restaurants and food trucks specializing in döner kebab have opened in various parts of the country; a substantial percentage are owned by German immigrants. Verts Mediterranean Grill, an Austin-based döner kebab chain with locations mainly in Texas, has become the second-largest döner kebab chain in the world.\n\nWith a multicultural population, the doner kebab in Australia competes with the Greek gyros and the Lebanese shawarma. Kebab sellers are subject to strict government food safety regulations.\n\nA halal snack pack is a dish that originated in Australia. It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat, chips / french fries, and sauces such as chili, garlic and barbecue. It is traditionally served in a styrofoam container, and has been described as a staple dish of takeaway kebab shops in Australia. The name of the dish was selected by the Macquarie Dictionary as the \"People's choice Word of the Year\" for 2016.\n\nHealth concerns regarding döner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and re-heating of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, have been reported in the media. Some investigations have found poor-quality ingredients in döner kebab meat, or meat types other than what was advertised. Food safety regulations in most countries address the dangers of bacteria in undercooked meat of all kinds, sold to the public. Some have guidelines specific to döner kebab handling and preparation. Following several outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning, the Canadian government in 2008 introduced a number of recommendations, including that the meat should be cooked a second time, after being sliced from the rotisserie. In Germany, any döner kebab meat placed onto the rotisserie must be sold the same day. It is a violation of health regulations to freeze partially-cooked meat for sale at a later date.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "877985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=877985", "title": "Mukataa", "text": "Mukataa\n\nMukataʿa () is an Arabic word for headquarters or administrative center.\nMukataas were mostly built during the British Mandate as Tegart forts and were used both as British government centers and as dwellings for the British administrative staff. Some Mukataas also included police stations and prisons. After the British left, the buildings often functioned similarly under the Jordanians, and then the Israelis.\n\nAfter the Oslo Accords, the Mukataas were used as governmental offices and headquarters for the Palestinian National Authority. The Mukaatas in Ramallah and Gaza, the two major Palestinian cities, were also used as headquarters to the high Palestinian Authority leadership, including as office for Yasser Arafat, long-time Palestinian Authority president.\n\nDuring Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002, the Israeli Defence Forces raided the Mukataas in the West Bank. Some Mukataas, including the Mukataa in Hebron, were entirely demolished.\n\nThe Mukataa in Ramallah, built in the 1920s during the British Mandate by the British engineer Sir Charles Tegart, was a military headquarters, a court of law and a prison. In May 1948, Jordan took over, and used the compound again as a prison and as a residence for Jordanian army officers and their families. From the occupation in 1967 it was the Israeli military headquarters, until the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994. In 1996, Arafat moved in and the Mukataa \nbecame the official West Bank headquarters, known as Arafat's compound.\n\nOn 29 March 2002, the Israel Defense Forces raided the compound and placed it under siege during Operation Defensive Shield. The Israeli army destroyed the offices of three security services, along with a VIP guesthouse, a prison, sleeping quarters for guards, a large kitchen, a car repair shop and a large meeting hall.\n\nThe siege was lifted on 2 May after 6 men wanted by Israel – 4 of them convicted of involvement in the October 2001 assassination of the Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Zeevi – were moved to a prison in Jericho to be guarded by U.S. and British wardens. The US-brokered plan was to enable Israel to avoid angering the United States over the Israeli Cabinet decision to bar a UN fact-finding mission from investigating allegations surrounding Israeli army actions in Jenin refugee camp during operation Rampart. Although the military had withdrawn from the compound, the cities and refugee camps in the West Bank remained surrounded by Israeli troops.\n\nOn 6 June 2002, the IDF executed a new siege after having attacked the headquarters with tanks, bulldozers and armored vehicles. Arafat's office building was partly destroyed, besides other parts of the compound. The attack was a retaliation on a suicide bombing carried out by an Islamic Jihad militant.\n\nWhile Arafat was building a new Cabinet, the Israeli army five days later strengthened the siege on his headquarters with the support of US President George W. Bush. The White House rejected Egypt's call for a quick timetable for Palestinian statehood and Bush hinted that an international conference was a long way off, \"because no one has confidence in the emerging Palestinian government.\"\n\nAfter a suicide bombing struck Tel Aviv on 19 September 2002, the Mukataa was again placed under siege. During the next ten days, the IDF destroyed all of the buildings that had survived the former sieges with bulldozers and explosives, including the main interior ministry building. Only part of the building where Arafat and his people remained was left.\n\nThe siege re-ignited Palestinian support for Yasser Arafat. On 24 September 2002, the UN Security Council demanded an end of the siege, but Israel ignored the Resolution. \n\nUN Under-Secretary-General Terje Rød-Larsen, one of the architects of the Oslo Accords, said on 27 September that \"\"the Israeli army's siege of Yasser Arafat amid the ruins of his bulldozed presidential compound could mean \"the death\" of hopes for a Palestinian state and a peace agreement.\"\" He alluded to the possible death of the two-state solution and said that \"\"we're moving in the direction of state destruction and not state-building\"\".\n\nOn 11 September 2003, the Israeli security Cabinet decided to \"remove\" Arafat, who still remained in the besieged compound. In a statement it said \"\"Recent days' events have proven again that Yasser Arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation... Israel will act to remove this obstacle in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately...\"\". The compound remained under siege until Arafat's transfer in October 2004, for medical care in a French hospital.\n\nIn the early days of November, when it was clear his death was near, several locations were mentioned as possible burial sites. Jerusalem was the first choice, but Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would not allow this.\n\nFollowing Arafat's death on 11 November 2004, the Palestinian leadership decided that he was to be \"temporarily\" interred in the Mukataa compound, pending the establishment of a Palestinian state and the transfer of his body to the Dome of the Rock compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Plans for Arafat to lie in state at the Mukataa prior to burial were canceled, because thousands of emotional mourners overwhelmed Palestinian security forces. Arafat was buried within the compound on 12 November, in a temporary manner. On 11 November 2007, a larger tomb clad in Jerusalem stone, and designed by Palestinian architects opened to the public. The message on the tomb indicated that the final resting place of Arafat shall be in Jerusalem, if it comes under Palestinian control.\n\n"}

The dish is a standard staple of street markets and readily available at all times. Being a typical Laotian/Isan dish, it is often paired with green papaya salad and sticky rice (Thai/Isan: ข้าวเหนียว, ; ). It is also eaten with raw vegetables, and often dipped in spicy sauces such as Laotian jaew bong.\n\nIn Thailand there are also many famous Thai Muslim varieties of \"kai yang\" which are not of Lao origin at all, but more akin to the grilled chicken from Malaysia.\n\nThe Laotian name for the dish is pīng kai () and means \"roast chicken\". In Laotian restaurants in the West, it is known as \"Laotian barbecued chicken\" or \"ping gai\". The Thai and Isan term is usually spelled ไก่ย่าง (\"kai yang\"; Isan: ), although ปิ้งไก่ (\"ping kai\"), a Thai letter rendering of the Laotian name, would be understood in Isan and in most of Thailand as well although to Thai ears it would sound a bit quaint, due to the slight grammatical difference between Thai and Laotian. Thais would put \"kai\" before \"ping\" rather than the other way round. In the West, where this dish often features on the menu of Thai restaurants, it is either known by its Thai name \"kai yang\" or as \"Thai barbecued chicken\".\n\nA whole chicken is often halved and pounded flat. It is marinated and then grilled over a low heat on a charcoal flame for a long time, but is not cooked to be burnt or dry. The marinade typically includes fish sauce, garlic, turmeric, coriander root (cilantro), and white pepper. Many variations exist, and it is also quite common to find black soy sauce, hoisin sauce, shallots, leaves and seeds of coriander, lemongrass, chilis, ginger, vinegar, palm sugar, and MSG. Compared to many Laotian/Isan dishes, it is mild and somewhat sweet.\n\n\n"}

The shark fins provide texture, while the taste comes from the other soup ingredients. It is commonly served at special occasions such as weddings and banquets, or as a luxury item in Chinese cuisine.\n\nThe soup originated centuries ago during the Song dynasty in China, serving the imperial family and court members. During the Ming dynasty, the dish's popularity increased and by the time of the Qing dynasty shark fin soup was in high demand. After the 19th century, the soup became highly sought-after dish as income levels of Chinese communities increased around the world. However, it is condemned by the Humane Society International, which says tens of millions of sharks are cruelly killed each year for their fins. Currently, international concerns over the sustainability and welfare of sharks have impacted consumption and availability of the soup worldwide.\n\nTraditional shark fin soup or stew is made with fins obtained from a variety of shark species. Raw fins are processed by first removing the skin and denticles, then trimming them to shape and bleaching to a more-desirable colour.\n\nSharks' fins are sold dried, cooked, wet, and frozen. Ready-to-eat shark fin soup is also available in Asian markets.\n\nDried fins come \"cooked/skinned\" (shredded) and \"raw/unskinned\" (whole), the latter requiring more preparation. Both need to be softened before they can be used to prepare soup.\n\nThe taste in the soup comes from the broth; the fins themselves are almost tasteless. Rather than for taste, the fins are used for their \"snappy, gelatinous\" texture, which has been described as \"chewy, sinewy, stringy.\" Krista Mahr of \"Time\" called it \"somewhere between chewy and crunchy.\"\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that shark fins can be used to treat any medical condition. Sharks biomagnify toxins, so eating shark meat may raise the risk of dementia and heavy metal poisoning such as mercury poisoning.\n\nShark fins are believed in Chinese culture to have properties of boosting sexual potency, enhancing skin quality, increasing \"qi\" or energy, preventing heart disease, and lowering cholesterol. In traditional Chinese medicine, shark fins are believed to help in areas of rejuvenation, appetite enhancement, and blood nourishment and to be beneficial to vital energy, kidneys, lungs, bones, and many other parts of the body.\n\nThere are claims that shark fins prevent cancer; however, there is no scientific evidence, and one study found shark cartilage generally to be of no value in cancer treatment.\n\nWildAid, a wildlife non-governmental organization, warned that eating too much shark fin can cause sterility in men. It is known that larger fish such as shark, tuna, and swordfish contain high levels of mercury and methylmercury salts. For soon-to-be-pregnant women, pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children, the United States Food and Drug Administration has advised avoiding consumption of fish high in mercury.\n\nHigh concentrations of BMAA are present in shark fins. Because BMAA is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills may pose a risk for degenerative brain diseases (such as Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig Disease).\n\nCounterfeit shark fins often also contain toxins.\n\nShark fin soup has a long history, but is recently declining in popularity.\n\nShark fin soup was reported in Ming dynasty writings and by the Qing dynasty was considered a \"a traditional part of formal banquets\"; in Chinese cuisine, it was considered to be one of the eight treasured foods from the sea. It was popular with Chinese emperors because it was rare, and tasty only after a complicated and elaborate preparation. By the time of the Qing dynasty, shark fin soup was in high demand. Its manual of cuisine, the Suiyuan shidan, indicates that the shark fin was eaten as soup, stew, and even as a stir-fry, but in all cases the fin had to be boiled for two days.\n\nThe popularity of shark fin soup rose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as standards of living began to improve.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, shark fin soup was a popular delicacy in China, and was eaten in Chinese restaurants around the world. The increasing wealth of the middle class raised demand. The shark fin trade more than doubled between 1985 and 2001.\n\nBased on information gathered from the Hong Kong trade in fins, the market was estimated in 2004 to be growing by 5% each year. Consumption of shark fin soup had risen dramatically with the affluence of the middle class, as Chinese communities around the world enjoyed increasing income levels. The high price of the soup meant it was often used as a way to impress guests, or for celebrations such as weddings, banquets, and important business deals. It was used to communicate wealth, power, and prestige, as it was believed to show respect, honor, and appreciation to guests, with 58 percent of those questioned in the WWF survey indicating they ate the soup at a celebration or gathering.\n\nIn Hong Kong restaurants, where the market had been strong, demand from Hong Kong natives had reportedly dropped in 2006. This was more than balanced by an increase in demand from the Chinese mainland, where economic growth put the expensive delicacy within the reach of an expanding middle class.\n\nA survey carried out in China in 2006 by WildAid and the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association found that 35% of participants said they had consumed shark fin soup in the last year, while 83% of participants in an online survey conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature said that they had consumed shark fin soup at some time.\n\nBy late 2013, a report in \"The Washington Post\" indicated that shark fin soup was no longer seen as fashionable in China.\n\nThe movement against shark fin soup began in 2006, when WildAid enlisted Chinese basketball star Yao Ming as spokesperson for a public relations campaign against the dish. The campaign was taken up by a coalition of Chinese businessmen, celebrities, and students. Businessman-turned-environmentalist Jim Zhang helped to raise concern within China's government, which pledged in 2012 to ban shark fin soup from official banquets within three years.\n\nIn January 2013, \"China Daily\" reported that officials in Zhejiang province found that many shark fin soup restaurants were selling artificial shark fins, and that one-third of the samples that the officials had obtained contained dangerous amounts of cadmium and methylmercury. Within two months of the \"China Daily\" report, China ordered officials throughout the country to stop serving dishes made from protected wildlife at official banquets, and the Hong Kong government issued a similar order in September.\n\nConsumption of shark fin soup in China has hence decreased. China's Ministry of Commerce indicated that consumption of shark fin soup during the 2013 Spring Break holiday had decreased by 50 to 70 percent, and from 2012, and Hong Kong industry groups reported that shark fin imports were down by 20 to 30 percent from 2012. Also, anecdotal evidence points to a worldwide drop in shark fin prices and a move away from shark fishing in parts of Africa.\n\nShark fins used in the soup are the cartilaginous dorsal, pectoral and caudal fins. These are regularly harvested by a process known as shark finning, which takes only the fins and discards the carcass, alive or dead. Overfishing poses a major threat to the world's shark populations.\n\nSome groups, such as Fins Attached, Shark Savers, IUCN, Shark Angels, Shark Whisperer and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, discourage consumption of the soup due to concerns with the world's shark population and how sharks are inhumanely finned alive and returned to the ocean, unable to swim, hunt or survive. The prevalence of shark finning and the sustainability of shark species are both debated. Some feel banning the dish is offensive. Major hotel operators such as Marriott International The Peninsula Hotels and Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts stopped serving shark fin soup in favor of offering sustainable seafood. The four largest supermarket chains in Singapore—Cold Storage, NTUC FairPrice and Carrefour—have stopped selling shark fins, citing sustainability concerns. Hong Kong Disneyland dropped the soup from its menu after it could not find a sustainable source.\n\nMalaysia's Natural Resources and Environment Ministry banned shark fin soup from official functions in a commitment to the Malaysian Nature Society to conserve the shark species.\n\nIn the United States, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have banned the sale and possession of shark fins, effectively eliminating the availability of the soup. Illinois, which had been a large importer of shark fins, was the fifth U.S. state, and the first non-Pacific state, to implement a ban on shark fin trade. In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act, closing loopholes used to obtain shark fins. In October 2011, California governor Jerry Brown, citing the cruelty of finning and potential threats to the environment and commercial fishing, signed Assembly Bill 376, banning the possession and sale of detached shark fins. Two Chinese American groups challenged the law in federal court, arguing among other things that it was discriminatory against the Chinese-American community. The federal courts rejected these claims.\n\nIn Canada, the Vancouver city council decided to work towards creating a ban to preserve shark species. Toronto joined other regional municipalities in adopting a shark fin ban on 13 October 2011. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice overturned the Toronto bylaw, as it was outside the powers of the city. Calgary banned shark fin soup on 16 July 2012, but in May 2013 shelved the bylaw indefinitely.\n\nOn 2 July 2012, the State Council of the People's Republic of China declared that shark fin soup can no longer be served at official banquets. This ban may take up to three years to take effect because of the social significance of the dish in Chinese culture.\n\nThe marine conservation organization Bite-Back has campaigned against the sale of shark fin soup in Britain. On the back of its campaigning, the London-based Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Hakkasan agreed to stop selling the controversial soup. High-profile names such as Gordon Ramsay, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and Charles Clover, author of \"\", have lent their support to the charity's 'Hacked Off' campaign.\n\nImitation shark fin soup is a noodle soup often sold in small bowls by street vendors in Hong Kong, where it is a common street snack. It is a substitute for shark fin soup. Imitation shark fin soup is also a more affordable alternative to shark fin soup.\n\nA popular, low-cost imitation shark fin soup () made using vermicelli is widely available in Asia. They can also be made from cellophane noodles. Seafood companies in Asia later developed edible gelatinous products to imitate shark fins' qualities, commonly referred as \"imitation shark fins\".\n\nSubstitutes for shark include imitation shark fin, konjac gel, various forms of noodles, and others. \"Mock shark's fin\" soup appeared in Hong Kong during the 1970s. From the 1990s onward, It became popular in many restaurants throughout China.\n\nImitation shark fin (), typically from Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is known as \"suchì\" in Chinese Mandarin and \"sou ci\" in Chinese Cantonese, literally means \"vegetarian fin\". A Taiwanese manufacturer's recipe for it contains water, gelatin, alginic acid, sugar, casein, and triolein to reproduce the chewy, gelatinous texture of shark fins. However, some of these imitations absorb the broth more quickly than the real shark fin. Konjac gel (known as \"moyu tofu\" in Chinese Mandarin, \"mo wu dau fu\" in Chinese Cantonese, and \"konnyaku\" in Japanese) can also be used as a substitute for shark fin once it is julienned into thin strands using a chef's knife or a food processor. While cellophane noodles are also often used as an alternative to shark fins, some cooks find them too soft and unable to withstand simmering long enough for flavors to be absorbed, consequently the imitation shark fin or julienned konjac gel are more desirable. Other substitutes include \"cucurbita ficifolia\" (shark fin melon), chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, and pig's skin or gelatin. Edible mushrooms, kelps, seaweeds, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and beaten eggs are added, as in the traditional soup.\n\nIn 2015, a seafood company from San Francisco was working on a variation of imitation shark fin using algae-derived ingredients and recombinant proteins.\n\nAlternatives to shark fin are inexpensive and easier to prepare. Imitation shark fin, konjac gel, and other alternatives can be purchased in preserved form from Asian supermarkets and convenience stores.\n\nImitation shark fin soup originated from Temple Street in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s. Few people at that time could afford genuine shark fin soup, but street vendors collected the broken parts of shark fins discarded by Chinese restaurants, cooked them with mushrooms, egg, and pork, as well as soy sauce and other ingredients. Cooking the mixture into a soup, it was served in a small bowl. This soup was inexpensive and lacked the authentic flavour but since it was cheap, tasty and contained lots of ingredients, it was popular among the poor and became one of the famous street-side snacks in Hong Kong.\n\nApart from the street-side, imitation shark fin soup may also be found in fast food stores and expensive Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, and also on mainland China. Since April 2016, Cup Noodles released various instant imitation shark fin ramen soups.\n\nFalse descriptions of goods and services are prohibited by the Trade Descriptions Ordinance in Hong Kong. Thus, imitation shark fin soup may have to change its Cantonese name since \"wun tsai chi\" (literally: \"fin in little bowl\") may mislead customers into thinking there is real shark fin in it. However, many argue against this new policy; some claim that the name is tied to the Hong Kong people's collective memories and culture, representing the history of old Hong Kong. It would also be inconvenient for tourists seeking the dish. Opponents of the name change suggest the government should consider whether customers are misled before carrying out the policy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "879384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879384", "title": "Entrée", "text": "Entrée\n\nAn entrée (, ; ) in modern French table service and that of much of the English-speaking world (apart from the United States and parts of Canada) is a dish served before the main course of a meal. Outside of North America it is generally synonymous with the terms \"hors d'oeuvre\", appetizer or starter. It may be the first dish served, or it may follow a soup or other small dish or dishes. In the United States and parts of Canada, and to a limited extent in France and other French-speaking areas, the term \"entrée\" refers to the main dish or the only dish of the meal. \n\nThe word “entrée” as a culinary term first appears in print around 1536, in the \"Petit traicte auquel verrez la maniere de faire cuisine\", in a collection of menus at the end of the book. There, the first stage of each meal is called the \"entree de table\" (entrance to the table); the second stage consists of \"potaiges\" (foods boiled or simmered “in pots”); the third consists of one or more \"services de rost\" (meat or fowl “roasted” in dry heat); and the last is the \"issue de table\" (departure from the table). These four stages of the meal appear consistently in this order in all the books that derive from the \"Petit traicté\". \n\nThe terms \"entree de table\" and \"issue de table\" are organizing words, “describing the structure of a meal rather than the food itself”. The terms \"potaiges\" and \"rost\" indicate cooking methods but not ingredients. The menus, though, give some idea of the foods and cooking methods that were characteristic of each stage of the meal.\n\nSausages, offal, and raw “watery” fruits (oranges, plums, peaches, apricots, and grapes) were apparently considered uniquely appropriate for starting the meal, as these foods appear only in the \"entree de table\". Certain other dishes served in the entree might also be served in the later stages of the meal, such as venison cooked in various ways (\"entree\", \"potaiges\" and \"rost\" services) and savory pies and sauced meats (\"entree\" and \"rost\" services). This distribution of first-course dishes is very similar to that of the menus in the \"Ménagier de Paris\", written 150 years before the \"Petit traicté\". \n\nThe stages of the meal underwent several significant changes between the mid-16th and mid-17th century, and notably, the entrée became the second stage of the meal, and potage became the first. At this point, the term “entrée” had lost its literal meaning and had come to refer to a certain type of dish, unrelated to its place in the meal. The cookbooks and dictionaries of the 17th and 18th centuries rarely discuss directly the composition of the dishes for each stage of the meal, though they routinely designate recipes or include lists of dishes appropriate to each stage. Nevertheless, entrées and the dishes of the other stages of the meal can be distinguished from each other by certain characteristics, such as their ingredients, cooking methods, and serving temperature. \n\nIn the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, entrées, on meat days, included most butchers’ meats (but not ham), suckling pig, fowl, furred and feathered game, and offal. Eggs, on meat days, were never served as entrées; they were served only as entremets. Vegetables often made up part of the sauce or garnish, but entrées were always meat dishes; vegetable dishes were served only as entremets. \n\nOn lean days, fish and eggs replaced meat and fowl in every stage of the meal; and on these days, eggs did appear as entrées. Few entrées were composed only of vegetables. During Lent, though, vegetable entrées (“\"entrées en racines\"”, encompassing all vegetables, not just “roots”) were sometimes served. \n\nMoist cooking methods were characteristic of this stage of the meal, typical preparations being sautés, ragoûts, and fricassées. Meat or fowl (but not fish) might be roasted, but it was first wrapped in paper, or stuffed with a forcemeat, or barded with herbs or anchovies, or finished in a sauce, or prepared in some other way to keep the dish from browning and crisping like a true roast. Savory pies and pastries were baked in dry heat, but the enclosed meat cooked in its own steam and juices. \n\nAll entrées were served hot, and this was a salient feature of entrées until the 19th century.\n\nThese distinctions were at first loosely observed, or perhaps more accurately, the “rules” were in a formative stage for several decades. By the early 18th century, specific ingredients and cooking methods were increasingly confined to only one stage of the meal.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, entrées were increasingly divided into new categories based on the content and preparation of the dish. “Hors d'œuvres”, which, in the late 17th century, were served at several points during the meal, were considered a type of entrée in the 18th century; but by the 19th century, they had become a distinct stage of the meal. Large, whole joints of meat (usually beef or veal) and very large fowl (turkey and geese) were categorized as \"grandes\" or \"grosses entrées\". When roasted, these same joints and fowl were called “spit-roasted entrées” (\"entrées de broche\"); they were always served with a sauce to distinguish them from true roasts. When boiled, a joint of beef was called the “le bouilli”; this was generally the first of the entrées consumed in the meal, after the potages and hors d’œuvres. In the late 18th century, the practice arose of removing the empty soup tureens and replacing them with additional \"grosses entrées\" or \"entrées de broche\"; these replacement dishes were commonly called “relevés”; they were last of the entrées consumed at the meal, though they often appear on menus right after the potages. Taken together, all these bulky dishes were called “substantial entrées” (\"fortes entrées\"). \n\nThe most numerous of the entrées at any meal were the “ordinary entrées” (\"entrées ordinaires\"), consumed between the bouilli and the relevés. In composition, they were distinguished from the \"fortes entrées\" by the relatively small size of their ingredients. Small fowl could be served whole; but large fowl and large joints of meat were cut into pieces or fillets. Despite the designation “ordinary”, these entrées were much more elaborate and refined than \"fortes entrées\".\n\nIn the 19th century, due at least in part to the collapse of the church’s authority in France, rules governing meat and lean days were followed irregularly. In particular, fish was commonly served on meat days, providing even more variety to the meal. Fish came to be considered a classic relevé, and in some cases was served as a separate “fish course”. After the 1820s, the bouilli was no longer routinely served at fine dinners. In addition, cold entrées became increasingly common over the course of the 19th century, a marked change from earlier practices. \n\nFollowing the widespread adoption of service à la russe in the 1860s, dishes were presented one after another rather than being placed on the table for guests to select what they wanted. In this new type of service, the ordinary entrées were often served \"after\" the relevés, particularly in France; in England, the ordinary entrées more commonly preceded the relevés, as in the 18th century. At this point, the two terms had completely lost their literal meanings. “Entrée” referred to those entrées served in slices, fillets, or small pieces; “relevé” referred to those entrées served as large joints, whole birds, or whole fish. \n\nDistinctions between the various types of entrées (\"grosses\", \"grandes\", \"de broche\", \"relevé\") had fallen out of use by the end of the 19th century. The entrée as a stage of a multi-course meal persisted in some circles after the Great War; but with the broad cultural transformations of the 20th century, the word lost its connection to its traditional meaning.\n\nIn France, the modern meaning of “entrée” on a restaurant menu is the small course that precedes the main course in a three-course meal, i.e., the course which in British usage is often called the \"starter\" and in American usage the “appetizer”. Thus a typical modern French three-course meal in a restaurant consists of “entrée” (first course or starter (UK); appetizer (U.S.)), followed by the \"\"plat\"\" or \"\"plat principal\"\" (the main course), and then dessert or cheese. This sequence is commonly found in \"prix fixe\" menus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "879412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879412", "title": "Rugbrød", "text": "Rugbrød\n\nRugbrød () (Danish style rye bread) is a very common form of rye bread in Denmark. \n\n\"Rugbrød\" usually resembles a long brown extruded rectangle, no more than 12 cm high, and 30–35 cm wide, depending on the bread pan in which it is baked. Ingredients typically include rye flour, cracked or chopped rye kernels and other seeds such as sunflower seeds, linseeds or pumpkin seeds. The dough may be made exclusively with rye and wheat flour or contain up to one third whole rye grains. Ale or beer can be substituted for some of the water component of a recipe.\n\nSourdough is almost always used for the base dough, as commercial yeasts are unsuitable. The naturally fermented dough will develop a \"Lactobacillus\" culture in symbiotic combination with naturally present yeasts. It is essential in baking rye-based breads because the chemistry of rye flour produces an environment that is acidic. The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is \"Saccharomyces exiguus\", which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced \"S. cerevisiae\", although the latter and other strains may also be present. Research has shown that when creating a naturally fermented starter, any naturally present \"S. cerevisiae\" will have died off after a few days. Sourdough is thus a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. The yeast produces carbon dioxide which leavens the dough, and the bacteria produces lactic acid which contributes flavor. The bacteria metabolizes sugars that the yeast cannot, and the yeast metabolizes byproducts of bacterial fermentation. Commercially produced yeast will not accomplish these processes in rye flour. \n\n\"Rugbrød\" is almost always very low in fat, comparable to most other varieties of bread. It contains no added oils or fats. Additional flavourings, other than salt, can include barley malt syrup. The bread is rich in whole grain and dietary fiber and contains little or no sugar, and is thus considered by many Danes as a healthy alternative to white wheat breads.\n\nButtered \"rugbrød\" is essentially the base for Danish open sandwich \"smørrebrød\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "879935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879935", "title": "Locking differential", "text": "Locking differential\n\nA locking differential is designed to overcome the chief limitation of a standard open differential by essentially \"locking\" both wheels on an axle together as if on a common shaft. This forces both wheels to turn in unison, regardless of the traction (or lack thereof) available to either wheel individually.\n\nWhen the differential is unlocked (open differential), it allows each wheel to rotate at different speeds (such as when negotiating a turn), thus avoiding tire scuffing. An open (or unlocked) differential always provides the same torque (rotational force) to each of the two wheels, on that axle. So although the wheels can rotate at different speeds, they apply the same rotational force, even if one is entirely stationary, and the other spinning. (Equal torque, unequal rotational speed).\n\nBy contrast, a locked differential forces both left and right wheels on the same axle to rotate at the same speed under nearly all circumstances, without regard to tractional differences seen at either wheel. Therefore, each wheel can apply as much rotational force as the traction under it will allow, and the torques on each side-shaft will be unequal. (Unequal torque, equal rotational speeds). Exceptions apply to automatic lockers, discussed below.\n\nA locked differential can provide a significant traction advantage over an open differential, but only when the traction under each wheel differs significantly.\n\nAll the above comments apply to central differentials as well as to those in each axle: full-time four-wheel-drive (often called \"All Wheel Drive\") vehicles have three differentials, one in each axle, and a central one between the front and rear axles (transfer case).\n\nAutomatic lockers lock and unlock automatically with no direct input from the driver. Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will \"unlock\" only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed \"automatic unlocking\" differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the differential carrier or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the famous \"Detroit Locker,\" made by Eaton Corporation, also known as the \"Detroit No-Spin,\" which replaces the entire differential carrier assembly. Others, sometimes referred to as \"lunchbox lockers,\" employ the stock differential carrier and replace only the internal spider gears and shafts with interlocking plates. Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.\n\nSome other automatic lockers operate as an open differential until wheel slip is encountered and then they lock up. This style generally uses an internal governor to monitor vehicle speed and wheel slip. An example of this is the \"Eaton Automatic Locking Differential\" (ALD), or \"Eaton Automatic Differential Lock\" (ADL), developed by the Eaton Corporation and introduced in 1973 for GM's \"Rounded-Line\" C/K Series pickups and utilities. The Eaton ADL is sometimes incorrectly called the \"Gov-Lok\", despite neither GM nor Eaton ever calling it by that name. \"Gov-Lok\" is rather an unofficial name of unknown origin that gained popularity over the years. Both Eaton and GM do not know where the name came from, and Eaton has made several unsuccessful attempts in the past to debunk the Gov-Lok name. An updated version of the old Eaton ADL design is still available from Eaton, now known as the \"Eaton mLocker\" mechanical differential lock.\n\nSome other automatic lockers operate as an open differential until high torque is applied and then they lock up. This style generally uses internal gears systems with very high friction. An example of this is the ZF \"sliding pins and cams\" available for use in early Volkswagens.\n\nSelectable lockers allow the driver to lock and unlock the differential at will from the driver's seat. This can be accomplished many ways. \n\nA spool is a device that connects the two axles directly to the ring gear. There is no differentiation side to side, so a vehicle equipped with a spool will bark tires in turns and may become unmanageable in wet or snowy weather. Spools are usually reserved for competition vehicles not driven on the street.\n\nMini-spool uses the stock carrier and replaces only the internal components of the differential, similar in installation to the lunchbox locker. A full spool replaces the entire carrier assembly with a single machined piece. A full spool is perhaps the strongest means of locking an axle, but has no ability to differentiate wheel speeds whatsoever, putting high stress on all affected driveline components.\n\nThe internal spider gears of an open differential can also be welded together to create a locked axle; this method is not recommended as the welding process seriously compromises the metallurgical composition of the welded components, and can lead to failure of the unit under stress. If it is desirable to have a spooled axle, the better option is to install either a mini-spool or a full spool.\n\nBecause they do not operate as smoothly as standard differentials, automatic locking differentials are often responsible for increased tire wear. Some older automatic locking differentials are known for making a clicking or banging noise when locking and unlocking as the vehicle negotiates turns. This is annoying to many drivers. Also, automatic locking differentials will affect the ability of a vehicle to steer, particularly if a locker is located in the front axle. Aside from tire scuffing while turning any degree on high friction (low slip) surfaces, locked axles provoke understeer and, if used on the front axle, will increase steering forces required to turn the vehicle. Furthermore, automatically locking differentials can cause a loss of control on ice where an open differential would allow one wheel to spin and the other to hold, \"while not transferring power\". An example of this would be a vehicle parked sideways on a slippery grade. When both wheels spin, the vehicle will break traction and slide down the grade.\n\nLimited-slip differentials are considered a compromise between a standard differential and a locking differential because they operate more smoothly, and they do direct some extra torque to the wheel with the most traction compared to a standard differential, but they are not capable of 100% lockup.\n\nTraction control systems are also used in many modern vehicles either in addition or as a replacement of locking differentials. Examples are by Volkswagen's \"electronic differential lock\" (EDL), Opel's TC+ installed for the first time in Opel Astra G (2001) etc. This is not in fact a differential lock, but operates at each wheel. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating more than some (e.g. 100) RPM more than the other (i.e. slipping) the traction control system momentarily brakes it. This transfers more power to the other wheel, but still employs the open differential, which is the same as on cars without the EDL option. If all drive wheels lose traction, then throttle control may be automatically applied. Electronic traction control systems may be integrated with anti-lock braking systems, which have a similar action on braking and use some similar components. Such systems are used for example on the most recent Nissan Pathfinder, Land Rover Defender, Land Rover Freelander, the McLaren P1 and the McLaren 650s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "882004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882004", "title": "Pozole", "text": "Pozole\n\nPozole ( , pozole), which means \"hominy\", is a traditional soup or stew from Mexico. It is made from hominy, with meat (typically pork), and can be seasoned and garnished with shredded lettuce, chile peppers, onion, garlic, radishes, avocado, salsa or limes. Pozole is typically served on New Year's Eve to celebrate the new year.\n\nIt is a typical dish in various states such as Nayarit, Sinaloa, Michoacán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Jalisco, and Morelos. Pozole is served in Mexican restaurants worldwide.\n\nPozole is frequently served as a celebratory dish throughout Mexico and by Mexican communities outside Mexico. Common occasions include Mexico Independence Day, birthdays, Christmas and other holidays.\n\nPozole was mentioned in the Florentine Codex by Bernardino de Sahagún. Since maize was a sacred plant for the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mesoamerica, pozole was made to be consumed on special occasions. The conjunction of maize (usually whole hominy kernels) and meat in a single dish is of particular interest to scholars, because the ancient Americans believed the gods made humans out of \"masa\" (cornmeal dough).\n\nAccording to research by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, on these special occasions, the meat used in the pozole was human. After the prisoners were killed by having their hearts torn out in a ritual sacrifice, the rest of the body was chopped and cooked with maize, and the resulting meal was shared among the whole community as an act of religious communion. After the Conquest, when cannibalism was banned, pork became the staple meat as it \"tasted very similar\" [to human flesh], according to Bernardino de Sahagún.\n\nPozole can be prepared in many ways. All variations include a base of cooked hominy in broth. Typically pork, or sometimes chicken, is included in the base.

{"id": "882813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882813", "title": "Gruel", "text": "Gruel\n\nGruel is a food consisting of some type of cereal—oat, wheat or rye flour, or rice—boiled in water or milk. It is a thinner version of porridge that may be more often drunk than eaten and may not need to be cooked. Historically, gruel has been a staple of the Western diet, especially for peasants. Gruel is often made from millet, hemp, barley or, in hard times, from chestnut flour or even the less bitter acorns of some oaks.\n\nThough its actual medical use is not proven, gruel has historically been considered an important form of sustenance for the sick and recently weaned children. Hot malted milk is a form of gruel, although the manufacturers of such products as Ovaltine and Horlicks avoid calling it gruel, owing to the negative associations attached to the word in popular culture, as in Charles Dickens's novel \"Oliver Twist\". From a literary, bourgeois, or modern point of view, gruel has often been associated with poverty. \"Gruel\" is also a colloquial expression for any watery or liquidy food of unknown character, e.g., pea soup. The word \"soup\" is derived from \"sop\", the slice of bread which was soaked in broth or thin gruel. Gruel was on the Third-Class menu of the \"Titanic\" on the eve of her sinking.\n\nGruel was the staple food of the ancient Greeks, for whom roasted meats were the extraordinary feast that followed sacrifice, even among heroes, and \"In practice bread was a luxury eaten only in towns\". Roman plebeians \"ate the staple gruel of classical times, supplemented by oil, the humbler vegetables and salt fish\", for gruel could be prepared without access to the communal ovens in which bread was baked. In the Middle Ages the peasant could avoid the tithe exacted, usually in kind, for grain ground by the miller of the landowner's mill by roasting the grains to make them digestible, and grinding small portions in a mortar at home. In lieu of cooking the resulting paste on the hearthstone, it could be simmered in a cauldron with water or, luxuriously, with milk.\n\nIn the Americas, maize gruels were once one of the main food sources for many Mesoamerican peoples, such as the Maya and Aztecs. \"\" was a preparation of ground maize that was often flavored with chili and salt. It could be consumed or drunk as an important calorie source and as a thirst quencher. \n\nIn many Spanish-speaking countries, several gruels are made; the masa-based drink called atole or atol de elote is a staple throughout Central America, served hot. Common in Mexican restaurants in the U.S., horchata is a chilled sweetened gruel drink made from ground nutmeats or seeds, grains (often rice) and seasonings such as vanilla and cinnamon, served over ice.\n\nRice gruels eaten throughout Asia are normally referred to as congee from the Tamil word for the food.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives an etymology of Middle English ' from the same word in Old French, both of them deriving from a source in Late Latin: ', a diminutive, as the form of the word demonstrates, possibly from an Old Frankish \"\", surmised on the basis of a modern cognate \"grout\". In modern Dutch, the plural word \"grutten\" still refers to de-husked, coarse ground grain. The German \"Grissmehl\", ground grain, in Dutch \"griesmeel\", semolina are grist to the English mill.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, gruel is remembered as the food of the child workhouse inmates in Charles Dickens's Industrial Revolution novel, \"Oliver Twist\" (1838); the workhouse was supplied with \"an unlimited supply of water\" and \"small quantities of oatmeal\". When Oliver asks the master of the workhouse for some more, he is struck a blow on the head for doing so. The \"small saucepan of gruel\" waiting upon Ebenezer Scrooge's hob in Dickens's 1843 novel \"A Christmas Carol\" emphasizes how miserly Scrooge is. Gruel is also Mr. Woodhouse’s preferred and offered dish in Jane Austen’s Emma (1816) often to comic or sympathetic effect. References to gruel in popular culture today continue to refer to miserly or starvation conditions, such as Gemma Collins in \"Celebrity Big Brother 17\" (2016), who was denied food for gruel.\n\n"}

In her book \"Food for Friends\", Barbara Kafka writes the dish was common in Italy before becoming popular in America in the early 1980s. Grappa, essentially a grape-based vodka, is occasionally used as an emulsifier in Italian cooking.\n\nThere have been multiple claims to the invention of the dish. According to Pasquale Bruno Jr., author of \"The Ultimate Pasta Cookbook\", penne alla vodka was invented at Dante, a restaurant in Bologna, Italy. Other historians of the culinary arts recognize James Doty, a graduate of Columbia University, as the inventor of penne alla vodka.\n\nThe \"Williams Sonoma Essentials of Italian\" cookbook states that it was invented in the 1980s by a Roman chef for a vodka company that wanted to popularize its product in Italy.\n\nAlong with the penne pasta, this dish generally contains cream sauce mixed with tomatoes or red sauce, which are a combination unusual in Italian cooking because the acidity of the tomatoes tends to make the oil in the cream separate. The vodka serves as an emulsifier, allowing the water and lipids to remain mixed together. It is also thought to release certain flavors from the tomato that would otherwise be inaccessible. This is seen in other vodka sauces, as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "885937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=885937", "title": "Quisp", "text": "Quisp\n\nQuisp is a sugar-sweetened breakfast cereal from the Quaker Oats Company. It was introduced in 1965 and continued as a mass-market grocery item until the late 1970s. Sometime afterward, the company sold the item sporadically, and upon the rise of the Internet began selling it primarily online. Quisp made its return to supermarkets as a mass-market grocery item in late 2012.\n\nQuisp was initially marketed with a sister brand, Quake. Television commercials featuring both brands were produced by Jay Ward, a major producer of animated television series.\n\nQuisp and the similarly marketed cereal Quake were originally released in 1965 in the United States by the Quaker Oats Company and generally advertised together (during the same commercial) with their character mascots competing against each other. The ads were cartoons created by Jay Ward, who also created the cartoon characters Rocky and Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right, and many others, and the Quisp ads used some of the same voice actors as the \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" series, including Daws Butler as the voice of Quisp (an alien who was the Crown Prince of Planet Q and, like moon men Gidney and Cloyd of \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", was armed with a scrooch gun) and William Conrad as the voice of Quake (a miner). In an interview, Ward's creative partner Bill Scott described Ward's involvement in cereal advertising: \"When the cereal company approached Jay about doing this stuff — I think it was in 1961 — he said, 'We’ll only do it as long as it’s fun.'\"\n\nThe commercials often asked children to choose which cereal was better, and to compete over taste or premiums. The competition reached its peak in 1972, when a series of commercials asked kids to vote for which cereal should remain on the shelves. Quake had a makeover in 1969, slimming down and changing his miner hat for an Australian bush hat and Australian accent. Quisp was the winner and Quake cereal was discontinued, but Quake himself introduced a new sidekick, an orange kangaroo named Simon and a new orange-flavored cereal called Quake's Orange Quangaroos. In 1976, Quaker Oats ran another contest, this time asking children to choose between Quisp and Quangaroos. Quisp won again and Quangaroos was discontinued.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Quisp was discontinued due to low sales. It was brought back in the mid-1980s, then again in the 1990s and in 2001, where it was relaunched as the \"first Internet cereal\". Consumers were encouraged to visit the Quisp Web site to view animated endings to cartoons on the back of the cereal box. The online Flash animation was produced by John Kricfalusi and Spümcø, featuring Quisp and his sidekick Quunchy (voiced by Corey Burton and Matt Danner, respectively).\n\nQuisp has remained in limited distribution, with Quaker Oats distributing the product in \"guerrilla displays\" that would appear in a store and last until the product sold out. Even in the late 2000s, it could occasionally be found in grocery and discount chains such as Dollar General, Marc's, SuperTarget, and Food Lion. Quaker Oats also sells Quisp directly to the public through an online store.\n\nQuisp is a baked paste of corn meal and syrup shaped like saucers. The taste is similar to fellow Quaker Oats cereal, Cap'n Crunch. Quake cereal was produced by the same process and ingredients, but shaped like the letter Q. Packaging as of 2012 carries the tagline on the front panel, \"Crunchy Corn Cereal\", and on side panels, \"QUAZY Energy Cereal\".\n\nMain ingredients: Corn flour, sugar, oat flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, salt. Vitamins and other additives: niacinamide, reduced iron, zinc oxide, yellow 5, yellow 6, thiamin mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, BHT, riboflavin, folic acid.\n\nQuaker Oats also offers a saucer-shaped cereal with identical ingredients in its Bagged Cereals line under the name Quaker Sweet Crunch.\n\nKevin Scott Collier. \"Jay Ward's Animated Cereal Capers\".

It consists of the sweetened juice of berries, like mors, but it is thickened with cornstarch, potato starch or arrowroot; sometimes red wine or fresh or dried fruits are added. It is similar to the Danish \"rødgrød\" and German \"Rote Grütze\". Swedish \"blåbärssoppa\" is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert.\n\nKissel can be served either hot or cold, also together with sweetened quark or semolina pudding. Kissel can also be served on pancakes or with ice cream. If the kissel is made using less thickening starch, it can be drunk — this is common in Poland, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIts name is derived from a Slavic word meaning \"sour\" (cf. Russian кислый \"kisly\"), after a similar old Slavic dish — a leavened flour porridge (or weak sourdough) which was made from grain — most commonly oats, but any grain, and even legumes like peas or lentils could be used, though bean kissels usually weren't leavened — and lacked the sweetness of the modern variants. Kissel is first mentioned in the old East Slavic Primary Chronicle where there is a story of how it saved the 10th-century Rus' city of Belgorod Kievsky, besieged by nomadic Pechenegs in 997. When the food in the city became scarce and a hunger started, the inhabitants of the city followed an advice of an old man, who told them to make kissel from the remnants of grain, and a sweet drink from the last mead they could find. Then they filled a wooden container with the kissel, and another one with the mead drink, put those containers into the holes in the ground and made up two fake wells over them. When the Pechenegian ambassadors came into the town, they saw how the inhabitants took the food from those \"wells\", and the Pechenegs even were allowed to taste the kissel and mead beverage. Impressed by that show and degustation, Pechenegs decided to lift the siege and to go away, having concluded that the Ruthenians were mysteriously fed from the earth itself.\n\nNowadays most Polish households prepare kissel from instant mixes instead of the traditional way. The most popular flavours are strawberry, gooseberry, and raspberry. In Russia, the most popular flavours are cranberry, cherry, and redcurrant. Cranberry kissel () is a traditional meal on Kūčios (Christmas Eve supper) in Lithuania. In Finland, kissel is often made of bilberries (since those can often be found growing wild in the forests and are thus both easy to gather and free) as well as from prunes, apricots, strawberries, etc. The thickness can vary depending on how much potato flour is used: thin bilberry soup is most easily consumed by drinking while the thickest version is almost like jelly and is eaten with a spoon. Rhubarb can also be used, but it is often combined with strawberries to make it less tart. Prune kiisseli (\"luumukiisseli\") is traditionally eaten with rice pudding on Christmas. Milk kiisseli (\"maitokiisseli\") is another variant, made from milk and flavoured with sugar and vanillin (or vanilla).\n\nIn Russian fairy tales, the land of marvels (similar to Cockaigne) is described as the land of \"milk rivers and kissel banks\". This expression became an idiom in Russian for prosperous life or \"paradise on earth\".\n\nAnother Polish and Russian phrase, “the seventh water after kissel”, is used to describe a distant relative.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "887484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=887484", "title": "Head (linguistics)", "text": "Head (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, the head or nucleus of a phrase is the word that determines the syntactic category of that phrase. For example, the head of the noun phrase \"boiling hot water\" is the noun \"water\". Analogously, the head of a compound is the stem that determines the semantic category of that compound. For example, the head of the compound noun \"handbag\" is \"bag\", since a handbag is a bag, not a hand. The other elements of the phrase or compound modify the head, and are therefore the head's \"dependents\". Headed phrases and compounds are called \"endocentric\", whereas \"exocentric\" (\"headless\") phrases and compounds (if they exist) lack a clear head. Heads are crucial to establishing the direction of branching. Head-initial phrases are right-branching, head-final phrases are left-branching, and head-medial phrases combine left- and right-branching.\n\nExamine the following expressions:\n\nThe word \"dog\" is the head of \"big red dog\" since it determines that the phrase is a noun phrase, not an adjective phrase. Because the adjectives \"big\" and \"red\" modify this head noun, they are its \"dependents\". Similarly, in the compound noun \"birdsong,\" the stem \"song\" is the head since it determines the basic meaning of the compound. The stem \"bird\" modifies this meaning and is therefore dependent on \"song\". \"Birdsong\" is a kind of song, not a kind of bird. Conversely, a \"songbird\" is a type of bird since the stem \"bird\" is the head in this compound. The heads of phrases can often be identified by way of constituency tests. For instance, substituting a single word in place of the phrase \"big red dog\" requires the substitute to be a noun (or pronoun), not an adjective.\n\nMany theories of syntax represent heads by means of tree structures. These trees tend to be organized in terms of one of two relations: either in terms of the \"constituency\" relation of phrase structure grammars or the \"dependency\" relation of dependency grammars. Both relations are illustrated with the following trees:\n\nThe constituency relation is shown on the left and the dependency relation on the right. The a-trees identify heads by way of category labels, whereas the b-trees use the words themselves as the labels. The noun \"stories\" (N) is the head over the adjective \"funny\" (A). In the constituency trees on the left, the noun projects its category status up to the mother node, so that the entire phrase is identified as a noun phrase (NP). In the dependency trees on the right, the noun projects only a single node, whereby this node dominates the one node that the adjective projects, a situation that also identifies the entirety as an NP. The constituency trees are structurally the same as their dependency counterparts, the only difference being that a different convention is used for marking heads and dependents. The conventions illustrated with these trees are just a couple of the various tools that grammarians employ to identify heads and dependents. While other conventions abound, they are usually similar to the ones illustrated here.\n\nThe four trees above show a head-final structure. The following trees illustrate head-final structures further as well as head-initial and head-medial structures. The constituency trees (= a-trees) appear on the left, and dependency trees (= b-trees) on the right. Henceforth the convention is employed where the words appear as the labels on the nodes. The next four trees are additional examples of head-final phrases:\nThe following six trees illustrate head-initial phrases:\n\nAnd the following six trees are examples of head-medial phrases:\n\nThe head-medial constituency trees here assume a more traditional n-ary branching analysis. Since some prominent phrase structure grammars (e.g. most work in Government and binding theory and the Minimalist Program) take all branching to be binary, these head-medial a-trees may be controversial.\n\nTrees that are based on the X-bar schema also acknowledge head-initial, head-final, and head-medial phrases, although the depiction of heads is less direct. The standard X-bar schema for English is as follows:\n\nThis structure is both head-initial and head-final, which makes it head-medial in a sense. It is head-initial insofar as the head X precedes its complement, but it is head-final insofar as the projection X' of the head follows its specifier.\n\nSome language typologists classify language syntax according to a head directionality parameter in word order, that is, whether a phrase is \"head-initial\" (= right-branching) or \"head-final\" (= left-branching), assuming that it has a fixed word order at all. English is more head-initial than head-final, as illustrated with the following dependency tree of the first sentence of Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\":\n\nThe tree shows the extent to which English is primarily a head-initial language. Structure is descending as speech and processing move from left to right. Most dependencies have the head preceding its dependent(s), although there are also head-final dependencies in the tree. For instance, the determiner-noun and adjective-noun dependencies are head-final as well as the subject-verb dependencies. Most other dependencies in English are, however, head-initial as the tree shows. The mixed nature of head-initial and head-final structures is common across languages. In fact purely head-initial or purely head-final languages probably do not exist, although there are some languages that approach purity in this respect, for instance Japanese.\n\nThe following tree is of the same sentence from Kafka's story. The glossing conventions are those established by Lehmann. One can easily see the extent to which Japanese is head-final:\n\nA large majority of head-dependent orderings in Japanese are head-final. This fact is obvious in this tree, since structure is strongly ascending as speech and processing move from left to right. Thus the word order of Japanese is in a sense the opposite of English.\n\nIt is also common to classify language morphology according to whether a phrase is head-marking or dependent-marking. A given dependency is head-marking, if something about the dependent influences the form of the head, and a given dependency is dependent-marking, if something about the head influences the form of the dependent.\n\nFor instance, in the English possessive case, possessive marking (\"s\") appears on the dependent (the possessor), whereas in Hungarian possessive marking appears on the head noun:\nIn a prosodic unit, the head is the part that extends from the first stressed syllable up to (but not including) the tonic syllable. A high head is the stressed syllable that begins the head and is high in pitch, usually higher than the beginning pitch of the tone on the tonic syllable. For example:\n\nThe bus was late.\n\nA low head is the syllable that begins the head and is low in pitch, usually lower than the beginning pitch of the tone on the tonic syllable.\n\nThe bus was late.\n\n"}
{"id": "888171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=888171", "title": "Capitonym", "text": "Capitonym\n\nA capitonym is a word that changes its meaning (and sometimes pronunciation) when it is capitalized; the capitalization usually applies due to one form being a proper noun or eponym. It is a portmanteau of the word \"capital\" with the suffix \"-onym\". A capitonym is a form of homograph and – when the two forms are pronounced differently – is also a form of heteronym. In situations where both words should be capitalized (such as the beginning of a sentence), there will be nothing to distinguish between them except the context in which they are used.\n\nAlthough some pairs, such as \"march\" and \"March\", are completely unrelated, in other cases, such as \"august\" and \"catholic\", the capitalized form is a name that is etymologically related to the uncapitalized form. For example, \"August\" derives from the name of Imperator Augustus, who named himself after the word \"augustus\", whence English \"august\" came. Likewise, both \"Catholic\" and \"catholic\" derive from a Greek adjective meaning \"universal\".\n\nCapital letters may be used to differentiate between a set of objects, and a particular example of that object. For instance in astronomical terminology a distinction may be drawn between a moon, any natural satellite, and the Moon, the natural satellite of Earth.\n\nA particular example of where capitonyms are prominent is in terminology relating to philosophy, religion, and politics. Capitalized words are often used to differentiate a philosophical concept from how the concept is referred to in everyday life, or to demonstrate respect for an entity or institution.\n\nIt is common practice to capitalize the pronouns referring to the Abrahamic God (He, Him, His, etc.) and many versions of the Bible, such as the NKJV, therefore do so. In this tradition, possessive pronouns are also capitalized if one is quoting God; \"My\" and \"Mine\" are capitalized, which should not be done when a human speaks. The pronouns \"You\", \"Your\", and \"Yours\" are also sometimes capitalized in reference to God.\n\nWords for transcendent ideas in the Platonic sense are often capitalized, especially when used in a religious context. Examples include \"Good\", \"Beauty\", \"Truth\" or \"the One\".\n\nThe word \"god\" is capitalized to \"God\" when referring to the single deity of monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Other distinctions made include \"church\" (meaning a building) and \"Church\" (meaning an organization or group of people), and the liturgical \"Mass\", versus the physical \"mass\".\n\nAs political parties are often named after philosophies, a capital letter is used to differentiate between a supporter of the philosophy, and a supporter of the party, for instance \"Liberal\", a supporter of any Liberal Party, and \"liberal\", a supporter of the philosophy of liberalism. Terms such as \"small-l liberal\" may be used to indicate the concept that an individual supports. Similar examples are conservative/Conservative, democrat/Democrat, libertarian/Libertarian, republican/Republican, socialist/Socialist, and a supporter of labour/Labour.\n\nThe following list includes only \"dictionary words\". Personal names (\"Mark\"/\"mark\"), place-names (\"China\"/\"china\"), company names (\"Fiat\"/\"fiat\"), names of publications (\"Time\"/\"time\") etc. are all excluded as too numerous to list. Adjectives distinct from placenames (e.g. \"Polish\"/\"polish\") are allowed. Pairs in which one word is simply a secondary meaning of the other – e.g. \"Masonry\" (secret society), which is in essence a peculiar use of the word \"masonry\" (wall building) – are omitted.\n\nThe following poem from Richard Lederer's \"The Word Circus\" is an example of the use of capitonyms:\n\nJob's Job\nIn August, an august patriarch\nWas reading an ad in Reading, Mass.\nLong-suffering Job secured a job\nTo polish piles of Polish brass.\n\nIn other languages there are more, or fewer, of these pairs depending on that language's capitalization rules. For example, in German, where all nouns are capitalized, there are many pairs such as \"Laut\" 'sound' ~ \"laut\" 'loud' or \"Morgen\" 'morning' ~ \"morgen\" 'tomorrow'. In contrast, in Italian, as well as Spanish, very few words (except proper names) are capitalized, so there are extremely few, if any, such pairs. An example in Spanish is \"Lima\" (city) ~ \"lima\" 'file (tool)' or 'lime (fruit)'. In Portuguese, an example is \"Peru\" (country) ~ \"peru\" 'turkey' (bird).\n"}

James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992 said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of surrealism and mass media, the latter consisting of technology and pop art—\"a form of technology art.\" He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which \"represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media\", and then incorporated collages of colour photocopies and spray paint with the artist's traditional medium of oil paint.\n\nIn 1995, he assembled a small group show near New York City and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show. The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated. He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism, which spread interest from artists in Los Angeles, Mexico and then Europe. Seehafer has said:\n\nThe differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media. It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.\n\nIn 2005, graffiti artist Banksy illicitly hung a rock in the British Museum showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which Shelley Esaak of about.com described as \"a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism.\"\n\nBritish artist Alan King started to experiment with a combination of digital and traditional art methods in the 1990s, producing a majority of his works by using computer techniques combined with a multitude of traditional methods including oils, acrylic, and watercolour.\n\nNationally renowned photographer Chip Simons incorporates both his photo images with digital collage.\nCecil Touchon, who works with sound collage & poetry, is a massurrealist artist.\n\nGerman artist Melanie Marie Kreuzhof, who describes her work as massurrealistic, was commissioned in 2004 by the editor of the \"Spectakel Salzburger Festsiele Inside\" magazine to produce an artwork about Erich Wolfgang Korngold's opera Die tote Stadt at the Salzburg Festival. To make her work she took 9 digital photographs, composed them in a computer and printed the result directly onto canvas, which was then attached to a wooden frame, worked on with acrylic paint and had objects attached—3 guitar strings, a strand of hair and a silk scarf. The images and elements were derived from themes in the opera.\n\nMetaphysical art\n\n\n"}

It is a popular snack across the Indian subcontinent; it is served in restaurants and sold by street vendors. It's also often found in Indian restaurants in the Western world.\n\nThe word \"pakoṛā\" is derived from Sanskrit पक्ववट \"pakvavaṭa\", a compound of \"pakva\" ('cooked') and \"vaṭa\" ('a small lump') or its derivative \"vaṭaka\", 'a round cake made of pulse fried in ghee'.\nSome divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word. The sound is a hard 'da' in the Telugu language and the 'ra' sound would be an incorrect pronunciation. The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ड़, and in Urdu with letter ڑ.\n\nHowever, in the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, the Hindi letter ड़ is transliterated as <ṛ>, popular or non-standard transliterations of Hindi use <d> for this sound, because etymologically, it derives from ड . The occurrence of this consonant in the word \"pakora\" has given rise to two common alternative spellings in English: \"pakoda\", which reflects its etymology, and \"pakora\", which reflects its phonology.\n\nIn India, particularly in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, such preparations are known as \"bajji\" rather than \"pakora\". Usually, the name of the vegetable that is deep-fried is suffixed with bajji. For instance, potato bajji is sliced potato wrapped in batter and deep-fried. In these Indian states, \"pakoda\" is taken to mean a mix of finely chopped onions, green chilis, and spices mixed in gram flour. This is then rolled into small balls or sprinkled straight in hot oil and deep-fried. Pakodas are very crisp on the outside and medium soft to crisp inside. There is a variety that is softer overall, usually termed \"media pakoda\" in restaurants, that is made from any other ingredient, such as potatoes.\n\nPakoras are created by choosing one or two main ingredients, such as onion, eggplant, potato, spinach, plantain, paneer, cauliflower, tomato, or chili pepper. They are also occasionally prepared with bread, buckwheat, groundnut, fish, or chicken. They are dipped in a batter made from gram flour and then deep-fried. The most popular varieties include \"pyaaz pakora\", made from onion, and \"aloo pakora\", made from potato. Other variations include \"paalak pakora\", made from spinach, and \"paneer pakora\", made from \"paneer\" (soft cottage cheese). When onions, on their own, are prepared in the same way, they are known as \"onion bajji\". A variation of pakora made from wheat flour, salt, and tiny bits of potato or onion (optional), is called \"noon bariya\" (\"nūn\" = salt) (), typically found in eastern Uttar Pradesh in India.\n\nPumpkin Pakora is a new variation of pakora.\n\nPakoras are usually served as a snack or appetiser.

{"id": "891531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=891531", "title": "Sachertorte", "text": "Sachertorte\n\nSachertorte () is a specific type of chocolate cake, or torte, invented by Austrian Franz Sacher in 1832 for Prince Wenzel von Metternich in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties. December 5th is National Sachertorte Day in the United States.\n\nRecipes similar to that of the Sachertorte appeared as early as the 18th century, one instance being in the 1718 cookbook of Conrad Hagger, another individual represented in Gartler-Hickmann's 1749 \"Tried and True Viennese Cookbook\" (\"Wienerisches bewährtes Kochbuch\").\n\nIn 1832, Prince Wenzel von Metternich charged his personal chef with creating a special dessert for several important guests. The head chef, having taken ill, let the task fall to his sixteen-year-old apprentice, Franz Sacher, then in his second year of training in Metternich's kitchen. The Prince is reported to have declared: \"Let there be no shame on me tonight!\" While the torte created by Sacher on this occasion is said to have delighted Metternich's guests, the dessert received no immediate further attention. Sacher completed his training as a chef and afterward spent time in Bratislava (Pressburg) and Budapest, ultimately settling in his hometown of Vienna, where he opened a specialty delicatessen and wine shop.\n\nSacher's eldest son Eduard carried on his father's culinary legacy, completing his own training in Vienna with the Royal and Imperial Pastry Chef at the Demel bakery and chocolatier, during which time he perfected his father's recipe and developed the torte into its current form. The cake was first served at the Demel and later at the Hotel Sacher, established by Eduard in 1876. Since then, the cake remains among the most famous of Vienna's culinary specialties.\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, a legal battle over the use of the label \"The Original Sacher Torte\" developed between the Hotel Sacher and the Demel bakery. Eduard Sacher completed his recipe for Sacher Torte while working at Demel, which was the first establishment to offer the \"Original Sachertorte\" cake. After the death of Eduard's widow Anna in 1930, followed by the bankruptcy of the Hotel Sacher in 1934, Eduard Sacher's son (also named Eduard Sacher) found employment at Demel and brought to the bakery the sole distribution right for an \"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\".\n\nThe first differences of opinion arose in 1938, when the new owners of the Hotel Sacher began to sell Sacher Tortes from vendor carts under the trademarked name \"The Original Sacher Torte\". After interruptions brought about by the Second World War and the ensuing Allied occupation, the hotel owners sued Demel in 1954, with the hotel asserting its trademark rights and the bakery claiming it had bought the rights to the name \"Original Sacher Torte\".\n\nOver the next seven years, both parties waged an intense legal war over several of the dessert's specific characteristics, including the change of the name, the second layer of jam in the middle of the cake, and the substitution of margarine for butter in the baking of the cake. The author Friedrich Torberg, who was a frequent guest at both establishments, served as a witness during this process and testified that, during the lifetime of Anna Sacher, the cake was never covered with marmalade or cut through the middle.\n\nIn 1963, both parties agreed on an out of court settlement that gave the Hotel Sacher the rights to the phrase \"The Original Sachertorte\" and gave the Demel the rights to decorate its tortes with a triangular seal that reads \"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\".\n\nThe cake consists of a dense chocolate cake with a thin layer of apricot jam on top, coated in dark chocolate icing on the top and sides. It is traditionally served with unsweetened whipped cream. \n\nThe \"Original\" Sacher Torte has two layers of apricot jam between the outer layer of chocolate icing and the sponge base, while Demel's \"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\" has only one. Additionally, the Sacher Torte has a more coarse grain of sponge whereas the Demel Torte sponge is denser and smoother.\n\nSome of the various recipes for cakes similar to the \"Original\" are listed below. For example, at \"Graz-Kulturhauptstadt 2003\", a festival marking the city of Graz being declared cultural capital that year, \"Sacher-Masoch-Torte\" was presented (its name alluding to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch), using redcurrant jam and marzipan.\n\nHotel Sacher's \"Original Sacher Torte\" is sold at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher, at Cafe Sacher branches in Innsbruck and Graz, at the Sacher Shop in Bolzano, in the Duty Free area of Vienna airport, and via the Hotel Sacher's online shop.\n\nThe recipe of the Hotel Sacher's version of the cake is a closely guarded secret. Those privy to it claim that the secret to the Sacher Torte's desirability lies not in the ingredients of the cake itself, but rather those of the chocolate icing. According to widely available information, the icing consists of three special types of chocolate, which are produced exclusively by different manufacturers for this sole purpose. The hotel obtains these products from Lübeck in Germany and from Belgium.\n\nVienna claims to be the \"coffee house capital of the world\". A strong tradition of coffee houses created an environment where both residents and visitors could meet, share ideas, and leisurely discuss the events of the day. The coffee house status in Vienna would become central to its culture and tradition with the cornerstone of each fine coffee house being its freshly baked cakes.\n\nThese classic tortes were to become highly regarded works of art and intense rivalries developed as to who could create the finest masterpiece. Today, the Original Sacher Torte is one of the most recognized cakes in the world and even helped establish the five star Hotel Sacher in Vienna founded in 1876 by Franz Sacher's son, Eduard Sacher. The Original Sacher Torte is still made almost entirely by hand using Franz Sacher's recipe and the exact composition is a closely guarded secret. More than 360,000 cakes a year are made in Vienna by its 41 employees, many of which are shipped all over the world allowing a \"taste of Vienna\" to be delivered to many far away places. The most popular destinations for its cakes are Germany, Italy, France, the US, and many countries in Asia.\nThe Original Sacher Torte is a combination of two layers of soft and light chocolate cake, separated by apricot jam and coated with a chocolate icing, often accompanied with unsweetened whipped cream.\nThe tradition of Grand Hotels having their own signature cake, continued with the creation of the \"Imperial Torte\" to celebrate the opening of the Hotel Imperial during the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna. The cake was designed to impress the Emperor Francis Joseph I and the square shaped chocolate torte is still produced today. Other Viennese classic cakes include a Sacher Torte made by Demel confectionery, which up until the early 1960s had fought a legal battle over the name rights of the cake. The \"Esterházy torte\" can trace its legacy back to the days of the noble Hungarian family of the same name and is still produced in many of Vienna's coffee houses.\n\nThe issue of the \"torte wars\" and the competition to create a memorable cake is significant, considering how coffee houses and their cakes have become an integral part of Viennese culture. Bookstore/coffee houses often provide the same type of environment, a place to relax, meet friends or family and talk about important issues in peoples lives. A number of new franchises being established shows a sign that America has embraced part of this exported Viennese culture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "895311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=895311", "title": "Ijiraq (mythology)", "text": "Ijiraq (mythology)\n\nIn Inuit mythology an ijiraq ( or ) is a sort of shape shifter who kidnaps children and hides them away and abandons them. The \"inuksugaq\" (or \"inukshuk\") of stone allow these children to find their way back if they can convince the ijiraq to let them go.\n\nIn North Baffin dialects \"ijiraq\" means Shape Shifter. While Tariaksuq appear like a half-man-half-caribou monster, an Ijiraq can appear in any form it chooses, making it particularly deceptive. When you are hunting somewhere that Ijirait (plural) inhabit, you will see them in the corner of your eye for a fleeting moment (like tariaksuq, shadow people). If you try to observe them directly however, they are completely elusive. They are sometimes helpful, sometimes fatally deceptive. One of the most noted places in the Arctic for sightings of these shape shifters (and tariaksuq) is the Freeman's Cove area of Tuktusirvik (place to hunt caribou), Bathurst Island. This rich oasis is surrounded in a horseshoe pattern by dormant volcanic mountains. Historically, Freeman's Cove is most notable as a stopover for the ship the Intrepid, and also for the failed attempts by the infamous modern-day explorer and eccentric Cory K. Buott at settlement.\n\nThe Ijirait are said to inhabit a place between two worlds; not quite inside this one, nor quite out of it. Inuit further south than the North Baffin group used to hold to a belief that some Inuit went too far north in the chase for game, and became trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living, and thus became the Ijirait. According to the small handful of surviving elders in the South Baffin Region that are knew these beliefs, the Inuit that are settled in Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord are these shape shifters or shadow people, because they went too far north. Some elders will avoid being in presence of extreme-northern Inuit, fearing they are evil Ijirait or Tariaksuq.\n\nThe home of the Ijirait is said to be cursed, and one will lose their way, no matter how skilled or familiar with the land: Buott and his wife Enoogoo were said to be out hunting once on the small peninsula across the bay from Freeman's Cove, and Buott, despite being a renowned navigator, became completely turned around. While he and his wife had been there before, and they could clearly see the camp where their children were on the horizon, Buott had to closely follow the trail of disturbed shale and rock to get back. It is thought by many that this temporary disorientation was due to the influence of the Ijirait. When Enoogoo and Buott finally returned to their children, they discovered a polar bear was circling the camp, sizing their children up for a meal.\n\nA local hunter with considerable local knowledge, Mark Amarualik, also of Resolute Bay, was said to have experienced this disorientation in the same place on a hunting trip a year before. The Inuit believe the Ijirait do this to confuse Inuit (people), and to keep them from moving into their areas. It is believed locally that is why Buott and Amarualik experienced this disorientation.\n\nOne plausible explanation for this unusual phenomenon is likely related to large deposits of sour-gas, of which can be disturbed by simply walking over top of the pockets, causing them to expel the toxic gas hydrogen sulphide. Buott and Enoogoo made reference in their journals of inexplicable gatherings of a variety of animal remains in seemingly random and mysterious piles. This corroborates the thought that the gas is responsible for these occurrences. Gas and sulphur smoke have been reported in the area as well as hot water springs discovered by the Amarualik (meaning wolf-like) family; all of which could cause a \"mirage\" causing to the traveller to see things such as Ijirait and Tariaksuq. The gas vapour or pockets low in oxygen could also account for hallucinations/sensations of being watched.\n\nVerified Sources:\n"}

In this use it is roughly comparable to the European titles of State Counsellor and counsellor of state. \n\nIn a military context, \"mushir\" became associated with the idea of the ruler's personal counsellor or advisor on military matters, and as such became the highest rank in Arab countries and the Ottoman Empire. It is used as the highest rank in most armed forces of the Middle East and North Africa, for armies, navies, and air forces. It is therefore equivalent to the ranks of Field Marshal and Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nIn Iraq under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi navy maintained a fleet admiral rank known as \"Mushir\".

The definitive characteristics of St. Louis-style pizza are a very thin cracker-like crust made without yeast, the common (but not universal) use of Provel processed cheese, and pizzas cut into squares or rectangles instead of wedges.\n\nThe thin, cracker-like round crust is made without yeast, as opposed to a deep dish Chicago-style pizza or the thin but leavened New York-style pizza. The crust of a St. Louis pizza is somewhat crisp and cannot be folded easily so the pizza is typically cut into three- or four-inch squares or rectangles instead of the pie-like wedges typical of many pizza styles. This may be done as the square shape can support the toppings better than wedge slices. Some local restaurants make their pizzas rectangular rather than round. St. Louis pizza is cut into squares and is referred to as \"party\" or \"tavern cut\". According to local legend, Ed Imo — founder of a prominent chain of St. Louis pizzerias — was a tile layer and cut his pizza accordingly.\n\nSt. Louis-style pizza sometimes includes a white processed cheese known as \"Provel\". Provel is a trademark for three cheeses fused to form one (provolone, Swiss, and white Cheddar), used instead of (or, rarely, in addition to) the mozzarella or provolone common to other styles of pizza. Provel cheese was developed by the St. Louis firm Costa Grocery in the 1950s and is made in Wisconsin primarily for the St. Louis market. The cheese is not widely available outside the St. Louis area but can be made by combining Swiss, sharp cheddar and smoked provolone cheeses.\n\nThe sauce is often seasoned with more oregano than other pizza types. Despite its thin crust, St. Louis-style pizza can be layered deeply with many different toppings because of the sturdiness of the cracker-like crust. Some of the sauces have a sweetness to them, which is likely due to the influence of Sicilian immigrants upon Italian foods in St. Louis.\n"}

Various seasonings and/or vegetables are often added during the cooking, depending on individual preferences. Today it is popular in most parts of India and is prepared in various ways.\n\nIn many Dravidian languages, the word \"uppu\" means \"salt\" and \"pindi\", \"mavu\" or \"hittu\" means \"flour\", hence the name \"uppindi\", \"uppumavu\" or \"uppittu\". In North India, it is called \"upma\".\n\nUpma is usually made with semolina (called \"rava\" or \"suji\" in India). The very basic method involves lightly dry-roasting the \"rava\" and mixing it thoroughly with a little salt and some boiling-hot water. There are many ways upma is prepared; indeed, every upma cook usually will incorporate variations in flavour when making upma. This variation is obtained by varying or emphasizing particular spices.\n\nThe most popular version with wide variations of upma are made with whole or refined ground wheat and rice of varied grain size, and/or vermicelli. Sometimes a wide range of vegetables may be added, and may be garnished with a variety of beans (raw or sprouted), cashew and peanuts. For a variation called \"masala upma\" (known as \"kharabath\" in Karnataka), sambar masala or garam masala is added along with red chilli powder, instead of green chillies. This variety is more popular in Karnataka, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh and is usually served in South Indian restaurants.\n\nWhole wheat or wheat dalia (cracked wheat) is a common variation of upma in Tamil Nadu, where it is eaten for breakfast or dinner. It can be eaten with banana, ghee or curd, and pickle, and is frequently also served with chutney and sambhar. Sometimes it is cooked with vegetables like peas, carrots, and beans.\n\nRice upma, which is mainly popular in Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Karnataka, is referred to as \"akki tari uppittu\" (rice coarse flour uppittu). Another variant of upma is prepared with grated coconut instead of onions, especially on holy days, when onion is avoided. This type of upma is generally smeared with ghee at the end of preparation. Dishes similar to upma can be made by substituting small crumbs of leftover bread or idli instead of flour. Upma made from coarser rava known as \"sajjige\" is a dish of Udupi cuisine. It is sometimes served along with snacks such as sautéed and spiced poha or chevdo.\n\nAnother variation, particularly as a breakfast dish, is corn upma, eaten with milk and nuts. Ginger, cumin, curry leaves, lemon juice and pepper powder may be used to season this dish. A common garnish is grated coconut and coriander leaves.\n\nIn Karnataka, upma is also served with another common sweet dish of Karnataka, kesari bhath (ಕೇಸರಿ ಬಾತ್), with a scoop of each on one plate, in a presentation commonly called \"chow chow bath\".\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, upma made with flattened rice in place of semolina is called atukulu upma (అటుకులు ఉప్మా). This variant is also known as aval upma in the Chennai region when made with rice flakes similar to poha.\n\nA popular light evening snack is upma made with vermicelli and tomato, peas and carrot.\n\nIn most parts of Odisha, a popular breakfast consists of sooji upma served with ghugni.\n\n\n"}

During the Western Jin dynasty (265–316 CE), Shu Xi () wrote about steamed cakes () in his \"Ode to boiled cakes\" (), written around 300 CE. He first called them \"mantou\" (). In this book, it was advised to eat this in a banquet during the approach of spring.\n\nThe Mongols are thought to have taken the filled (\"baozi\") style of \"mantou\" to many countries of Central and East Asia about the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty in the 13th century. The name \"mantou\" is cognate to \"manty\" and \"mantı\"; these are filled dumplings in Turkish, Persian, Uzbek, (\"mantu\") cuisines.\n\nA popular Chinese legend relates that the name \"mantou\" actually originated from the homophonous word \"mántóu\", which literally means \"barbarian's head\".\n\nThe legend was set in the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE) when Zhuge Liang, the Chancellor of the state of Shu Han, led the Shu army on a campaign against Nanman forces in the southern lands of Shu, which correspond to roughly present-day Yunnan, China, and northern Myanmar.\n\nAfter subduing the Nanman king Meng Huo, Zhuge Liang led the army back to Shu, but met a swift-flowing river which defied all attempts to cross it. A barbarian lord informed him that in olden days, the barbarians would sacrifice 50 men and throw their heads into the river to appease the river deity and allow them to cross. As Zhuge Liang did not want to cause any more of his men to lose their lives, he ordered his men to slaughter the livestock the army brought along, and fill their meat into buns shaped roughly like human heads (round with a flat base). The buns were then thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he named the bun \"barbarian's head\" (\"mántóu\", 蠻頭, which evolved into the modern 饅頭). Another version of the story relates back to Zhuge Liang's southern campaign when he instructed that his soldiers who had fallen sick from diarrhea and other illnesses in the swampy region be fed with steamed buns with meat or sweet fillings.\n\nPrior to the Song dynasty (960–1279), the word \"mantou\" meant both filled and unfilled buns. The term \"baozi\" arose in the Song dynasty to indicate filled buns only. As a result, \"mantou\" gradually came to indicate only unfilled buns in Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese.\n\nIn many areas, however, \"mantou\" still retains its meaning of filled buns. In the Jiangnan region where Wu Chinese is spoken, it usually means both filled and unfilled buns. In Shanxi, where Jin Chinese is spoken, unfilled buns are often called \"momo\" (饃饃), which is simply the character for \"steamed bun\". The name \"momo\" spread to Tibet and Nepal and usually now refers to filled buns or dumplings.\n\nThe name \"mantou\" is cognate to \"manty\" and \"mantı\"; these are filled dumplings in Turkish, Persian, Uzbek, and Pakistani (\"mantu\") cuisines. In Japan, \"manjū\" (饅頭) usually indicates filled buns, which traditionally contain bean paste or minced meat-vegetable mixture (nikuman 肉まん \"meat \"manjū\"\"). Filled \"mantou\" are called \"siyopaw\" in Philippine, ultimately derived from Chinese \"shāobāo\" (燒包). In Thailand, they called filled \"mantou\" as \"salapao\" (ซาลาเปา). In Korea, \"mandu\" (; ) can refer to both \"baozi\" or \"jiaozi\" (餃子). In Mongolian cuisine, \"manty or mantu\" are steamed dumplings and a steamed variation is said to have led to the Korean mandu. In Singapore, the dish chilli crab is commonly served with a fried version of mantou.\n\n"}

Golden ginger ale; which is dark colored and more strongly flavoured; and dry ginger ale, which is more common today. Dry ginger ale was developed during prohibition when ginger ale was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages which made the stronger flavour of the golden variety undesirable. Dry ginger ale quickly became more popular than golden, and today golden ginger ales like Sussex are an uncommon and usually a regional drink. People who visit the Maritime Provinces often bring Sussex Ginger Ale back home for friends and relatives who have connections to the Maritime Provinces. \n\nOther soft drinks with the Sussex name have been Sussex Old English Ginger Beer, Sussex Pale Dry Ginger Ale, Sussex Red Oval Ginger Ale, and Sussex Cola.\n\nThe brand has had various owners including Sussex Mineral Spring Co., Sussex Ginger Ale Ltd., Maritime Beverages Ltd., Great Pacific Industries Inc., Canadian 7up, and Crush Canada Inc.

One brand of marshmallow creme is Marshmallow Fluff, which is used to make the New England classic comfort food, the Fluffernutter sandwich, which debuted in 1918 in Massachusetts, just a year after marshmallow creme was invented.\n\nFluff is manufactured by Durkee-Mower, Inc.; its ingredients include corn syrup, sugar syrup, vanilla flavor, and egg whites.\n\nMany late-19th-century \"marshmallow paste\" recipes produced solid foods. The earliest mention of marshmallow creme in an American cookbook is from \"Fannie Farmer's Boston School Cook Book\", printed in 1896. However, the author does not give a recipe for marshmallow cream in this book, instead giving a recipe for marshmallow paste in the cake filling section. In 1902, \"Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book\" by Sarah Tyson Rorer describes her recipe for \"marshmallow filling\".\n\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, Somerville, Massachusetts, resident and inventor of the product Archibald Query started selling his version door-to-door. He soon afterward sold the recipe to two candy makers in Lynn, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred Mower, for $500. The product first hit market shelves in cans as Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff in 1917. The first two words were dropped soon after the packaging changed to a glass jar in the 1940s. Today, the Durkee-Mower company is one of only three companies in North America to produce marshmallow creme, the other products being Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme and Solo Marshmallow Creme.\n\n\"Fluff\" continues as a regional tradition in the Northeastern United States. One popular use is in the Marshmallow Fluff and peanut butter sandwich (Fluffernutter). Also, the container has a \"no-fail\" recipe for chocolate fudge printed on the side.\n\nSince at least 2006, the city of Somerville has celebrated Query's original creation of Fluff with an annual festival in Union Square titled \"What the Fluff?\". Typical activities at the festival have included a science fair, gallery show, cooking contests, and carnival games such as a bean-bag toss, all themed around Marshmallow Fluff. In 2011, actress Susan Olsen, most famous for portraying Cindy Brady on the \"Brady Bunch\", attended the festival, where she sold her marshmallow fluff-inspired art.\n\nAccording to a 2006 \"Boston Globe\" article, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios proposed a restriction on the number of weekly servings of Marshmallow Fluff (Fluffernutter) sandwiches in the form of an amendment to a bill that will limit junk food in schools. The proposal was later dropped. Also in 2006, State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein planned to file a bill that would make the Fluffernutter the official sandwich of Massachusetts. The incident is locally referred to as \"The Great 2006 Kerfluffle.\"\n\nMarshmallow creme is also a traditional confection in Arabic cuisine, where it is commonly referred to as soapwort meringue (natef). The original recipe is based on soapwort (roots of \"Saponaria officinalis\") or roots of the marshmallow plant, but modern commercial varieties are nearly identical to marshmallow creme. It was mentioned in a tenth-century Arabic cookbook, Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ (the book of dishes) by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "903641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=903641", "title": "Owned", "text": "Owned\n\nOwned is a slang word that originated among 1990s hackers, where it referred to \"rooting\" or gaining administrative control over someone else's computer. The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming. Other variations of the word owned include own3d, 0wn3d, pwned, and pooned, terms which incorporate elements of leetspeak. \n\nIn 2009, Newgrounds described a security vulnerability in ActiveX as leaving Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server users open to a \"Browse-And-Get-Owned\" attack.\n\n\"Owned\" has now spread beyond computer and gaming contexts and become part of standard slang, especially in social media, and is typically used to signify severe defeat or humiliation, usually in an amusing way or through the dominance of an opposing party, in diverse contexts ranging from sports to politics (e.g. \"Obama owns Fox News\" or \"Trump owns CNN\"). \n\nThe term's original usage was close to that of the traditional meaning of the word \"own\" – for instance, \"I owned the network at MIT\" indicated that the speaker had cracked the servers and had the same root-level privileges that the legitimate owner of the servers had. Some more examples are \"I owned you\" and \"You got owned\". \"Owned,or Ownded\" a later variant, became more common in the late 1990s, as did the more abstract usage referring to any compromised security mechanism. By 1997, \"Owned\" was regularly used in website defacements.\n\nThe term \"owned\" subsequently spread to gaming circles, where it was used to refer to defeat in a game. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a multiplayer video game, it is not uncommon for him or her to say \"owned\" to the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. \"Ownage\" has become a modern equivalent to \"turkey shoot\"; applicable when an experienced faction predictably annihilates a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, \"owned\" can be an adjective (He is owned), \"owning\" can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and \"ownage\" can be a noun.\n\nThe phrase \"own\" can not only refer to defeating one particular player or team, but it can also be used to indicate total domination of the competition. The racing video game \"\" follows this definition by awarding a special bonus called \"Own it\", in which a player earns points for every second they spend in first place, while also expressing their dominance visually to other opponents by painting every portion of the course where they lead with their tag and colors.\n\nIn the late 2010s, the concept of ownage (specifically, \"owning the libs\") has become a defining ethos of right-wing politics in the United States. Ben Shapiro describes the concept in the National Review: \n\nIn other words, Republicans and conservatives may often prioritize opportunities to make Democrats and liberals feel bad, sometimes to a greater degree than actual policy achievement. This pugilistic style of politics is especially popular with Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\nHowever, this is a controversial practice inside and outside the Republican party. For example, Nikki Haley said \"I know that it's fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you're accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone?\"\n"}

{"id": "904080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904080", "title": "Bag of holding", "text": "Bag of holding\n\nA bag of holding is a fictional magical item in the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" roleplaying game, capable of containing objects larger than its own size. Since its introduction, it has appeared in other media.\n\nA \"bag of holding\" appears to be a common cloth sack of about in size. It opens into a nondimensional space (similar to a magic satchel) or a pocket dimension, making the space larger inside than it is outside. Each \"bag of holding\" always weighs the same amount, between , regardless of what is put into it. It can store a combined weight of up to forty times its own weight, and a combined volume of . A living creature put in a \"bag of holding\" will suffocate after about 10 minutes.\n\nIf a \"bag of holding\" is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it (from outside or inside), the \"bag\" will rupture and be ruined, the contents lost forever in \"nilspace\".\n\nOther magical bags similar to the bags of holding include:\n\n\nSome bags outwardly indistinguishable from a bag of holding have highly undesirable qualities. They are created by spellcasters either purposefully (especially in the case of a bag of devouring), or as a result of a failed spell in the process of creating a bag of holding.\n\nEssentially a bottomless pit in a bag, this bag appears to be a normal sack, like a bag of holding, and seems to be a bag of holding on closer inspection. However, the bag is a lure used by an extradimensional creature; it is one of its feeding orifices. Issue 271 of \"Dragon\" featured an article titled \"The Ecology of a Bag of Devouring\" that discussed the nature of such a creature.\n\nAny substance of animal or vegetable matter put into the bag has a chance of being swallowed over time. Even a person reaching in to retrieve or place an item, after the initial time, has a chance of being completely dragged into the bag and swallowed. The bag of devouring will act as a bag of holding, but every hour it has an increasing chance of swallowing the contents. Any plants or animals swallowed by the bag in this way are transported to the creature's stomach, digested, and lost forever, while inedible items are swallowed and spat into another plane.\n\nThis magical sack will perform as a bag of holding for 2–10 uses. At some point, however, the magical field will waver, causing precious metals and gems stored in the bag to be turned into common metals and worthless stones. Any magical items placed in the bag will become ordinary lead, glass, or wood as appropriate once the transmuting effects have begun.\n\nIn the physics of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", putting a bag of holding inside a portable hole will cause a rift to be opened to the Astral Plane, and both items will be lost forever. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it instead opens a gate to the Astral Plane, sucking in every creature in a ten-foot radius, and destroying both the bag and hole. The contents of the bags are either scattered throughout the Astral Plane or destroyed. Placing bags of holding into one another (or within a Heward's handy haversack or vice versa) has no adverse effects in the 4th edition of the game and would allow one to store an unlimited quantity of items (each bag of holding being limited in total weight capacity to roughly 40 additional bags, depending on the size of each).\n\nIn earlier editions of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", putting one bag of holding inside another would have the same effect as placing a portable hole into a bag of holding. Interactions with portable holes had the effects listed above.\n\nThe Bagworld is the basis of especially capacious holding devices (e.g. the \"fanny pack of hefty capacity\") in the \"Knights of the Dinner Table\" \"HackMaster\" roleplaying game (originally a fictionalized form of \"Dungeons & Dragons\"). Bagworld is another planet (possibly located on another plane of reality) that is accessed via bag devices, enabling characters to cache enormous amounts of materials. Bagworld possesses its own, apparently infinite breathable atmosphere, but no known native lifeforms; thus, a living creature placed inside is in no danger of suffocation, though death by starvation and/or dehydration is possible if the creature is not supplied with provisions. From the Bagworld point of view, there are a great many holes in the sky from which giants deposit and retrieve items (a creature or object that completely enters the bag device will shrink to Bagworld's scale once inside). If a bag device connected to Bagworld is placed inside another such device, the device placed inside is destroyed, and the contents of all remaining connected devices are \"shuffled\", with each device's contents moved to the accessible space of another (random) storage device.\n\nIn the roguelike computer game \"NetHack\", a bag of holding has slightly different properties:\n\nIn the first-person shooter video game \"Heretic\", a bag of holding is a collectible item that permanently doubles the player's ammunition capacity.\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novel \"Making Money\", wizard Ponder Stibbons is placed in charge of the \"Cabinet of Curiosity\", which he describes as \"a classic Bag of Holding but with \"n\" mouths, where \"n\" is the number of items in an eleven-dimensional universe which are not currently alive, not pink and can fit in a cubical drawer on a side, divided by P.\" To ask what \"P\" is, is \"the wrong sort of question.\" The Cabinet manifests as a \"tree\" of drawers within drawers within drawers, that open in an unfolding fractal pattern of iterations. Iteration one is a simple cabinet, but by the time of the novel they have managed to increase the number of drawers until the Cabinet fills a cathedral-sized room (actually a standard sized room, but the wizards increased the space by decreasing time; asking how is the wrong kind of question). Each drawer holds an apparently random object. If any objects are removed from the cabinet for longer than 14.14 hours, it ceases to work, limiting its usefulness.\n\nAlso in Discworld is the Luggage, a variant of Heward's handy haversack. However, the Luggage has the added benefit that any clothes put in will come out pressed, folded and smelling faintly of lavender. Additionally, it will attack with murderous mindlessness anyone who threatens its owner by stomping on them with its hundreds of little feet. It is also possible that the Luggage will swallow an assailant, and it has been described as having rows of teeth like a shark, which can appear and disappear as needed. It also has command of a possibly infinite number of dimensions, thus anyone it swallows will disappear to a separate dimension from the clothes it carries. It has also been known to lure people into leaning into it by filling itself with gold and gems.\n\nIn Robert Heinlein's fantasy \"Glory Road\" book, a similar magic object – although not a bag, a fold box is a little black box 'about the size and shape of a portable typewriter', that can be opened again and again 'unfolding its sides and letting them down until it is the size of a small moving van' when folded back up it does not weigh more than a few pounds, even though tons of materials may be carried around in it.\n\nThough its appearance is never described, the Thing Your Aunt Gave You Which You Don't Know What It Is in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" computer game is a Bag of Holding that can hold any number of other items and never becomes too heavy to carry. Only one item the player encounters in the game will not fit inside it. Also, if dropped, the Thing mysteriously reappears in the player's possession several turns later, even if the player is already holding as much as they can carry, so dropping it essentially increases the player's carrying capacity by one item each time it is dropped.\n\nA bag of holding is used to allow use of a universe destroying \"Ice-9\" spell (the enemy is thrown into the bag and the spell fired after them, destroying only the bag's pocket universe rather than the regular universe).\n\nA later strip bears the odd title \"I turned my bag of holding inside-out, wrapped it around me, and walked out through the dungeon walls\", which is apparently a reference to either a comedy skit by Dead Alewives or a website parodying bad D&D ideas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "904644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904644", "title": "Sisu", "text": "Sisu\n\nSisu is a Finnish concept described as stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness and is held by Finns themselves to express their national character. It is generally considered not to have a literal equivalent in English.\n\n\"Sisu\" is a grim, gritty, white-knuckle form of courage that is presented typically in situations where success is against the odds. It expresses itself in taking action against the odds and displaying courage and resoluteness in the face of adversity, in other words, deciding on a course of action and then sticking to that decision, even despite repeated failures. It is in some ways similar to equanimity, with the addition of a grim kind of stress management.\n\n\"Gutsy\" is a fairly close translation that uses the same metaphor (found in more languages than Finnish and English), as the word derives from \"sisus\", which means \"interior\" and \"entrails, guts\". A concept closely related to \"sisu\" is grit, which shares some of its denoting elements with \"sisu\", save for \"stress management\" and passion for a long-term goal. \"Sisu\" may have an element of passion but it is not always present, unlike in the case of grit as defined by Dr. Angela Duckworth.\n\n\"Sisu\" is a term which dates back hundreds of years and is described as being integral to understanding Finnish culture. It is a term for going beyond one's mental or physical capacity, and is a central part of the country's culture and collective discourse. However, hardly any empirical research has been done to explore the meaning of this construct as a possible psychological strength resource, and it has long seemed to have a somewhat elusive nature. It has been usually studied as a cultural component among Finns and Finnish Americans, but as a psychological construct has remained under-researched and poorly defined.\n\nAs early as the 1940s, attempts were made to grasp the essence of \"sisu\". The Finnish newspaper \"Uusi Suomi\" reached out to its audience for their definition of \"sisu\", and conducted a contest. \"Uusi-Suomi\" wrote: \"All of us somewhat know what sisu is ... [it] has for long been a topic for discussion here in Finland and abroad. But how do we describe and define what sisu really is?\". The quest for putting the essence of \"sisu\" into a definitive form has evidently been around for almost a century. More recently, William R. Aho, professor emeritus of sociology at Rhodes College, raised questions about \"sisu\", and stated that \"we need a good deal of organized, systematic scientific research to discover the scope and depth of \"sisu\", geographically and situationally, and the depth and strength of both the beliefs and behaviors surrounding and emanating from \"sisu\".\"\n\nA recent study aimed to fill in that gap, and offer a more precise language for discussing the term. While examining \"sisu\" within the psychological framework, it sought to render it less elusive as a construct by giving it an easily citable definition rooted within the field of positive psychology. \"Sisu\" as a \"psychological power potential\" was introduced for the first time in the 3rd World Congress on Positive Psychology in Los Angeles on 29 June 2013. In the study, \"sisu\" is described as a psychological key competence which enables extraordinary action to overcome a mentally or physically challenging situation. \"Sisu\" also contributes to what has been named \"the action mindset\"; a consistent, courageous approach toward challenges which at first seem to exceed our capacities. A related on-line survey (conducted between March and May 2013) tracked the cultural representations of \"sisu\" among contemporary Finns (and Finnish Americans) and revealed that \"sisu\" is still deeply valued, and that there is public interest for cultivating this strength capacity as well. All in all, the study received 1,060 responses. Among the main findings was the perception of \"sisu\" as a reserve of power, which enables extraordinary action to overcome mentally or physically challenging situations (rather than being the ability to pursue long-term goals and be persistent). To elaborate on the function of \"sisu\": it is a powerful psychological potential which enables the individual to tap into mental strength beyond their pre-conceived resources. Wielding \"sisu\" in the face of adversity helps individuals push through what first seemed like the boundaries of their mental or physical capacities. Furthermore, \"sisu\" is an action mindset which equips the individual to choose to take on challenges beyond their observed capacities. It provides the final empowering push when we would otherwise hesitate to act. \"Sisu\" can be conceptualized as taking action against the odds. Additionally, even though 53% of the respondents believed some people innately have more \"sisu\", a majority of 83% of the respondents believed that \"sisu\" is a flexible quality which can be cultivated through conscious practice (rather than a being a fixed quality), and the majority of respondents were interested in developing this capacity.\n\n\"Sisu\" is not always an entirely positive quality. In Finnish, \"pahansisuinen\" literally translated means \"one possessing bad sisu\", a description of a hostile and malignant person. Furthermore, the answers from the \"sisu\" survey indicate that there can be too much \"sisu\", and according to the survey answers this leads to bull-headedness, foolhardiness, self-centeredness and inflexible thinking. The study suggests that \"sisu\" should be informed by reason and cultivated (and practiced) with self-compassion.\n\nLike any trait or psychological capacity, \"sisu\" is the complex product of genetic, psychological, biological and social factors, and its comprehensive understanding will require studies from multiple scientific perspectives. Finland may have the initial monopoly on \"sisu\" as a cultural construct, but it is a universal capacity and the potential for it exists within all individuals. The transformative power of narrative is widely acknowledged Through the process of social transfer of narratives, values become embedded within a culture and connected to the thought processes of its individuals. People, through their choices and actions, bring these narratives to life in a dynamic process which can prime the behavior of an entire nation. Fostering \"sisu\" may very well be embedded in such behavior, rather than being a genetical trait which one is born with. \"Sisu\" is a new term in the field of positive psychology, and it may contribute to our understanding of the determinants of resilience, as well as of achievement and the good life. It is suggested that positive psychology research could benefit from focusing future interest on the unique cultural resource of \"sisu\" that individuals across the globe can leverage; as well as actively examining relevant constructs from other cultures.\n\n\"Sisu\" has been described as \"the word that explains Finland\", and the Finns' \"favorite word\"—\"the most wonderful of all their words.\"\nAs defined by Roman Schatz in his book \"From Finland with Love\" (2005), \"sisu\" is an ability to finish a task successfully.\nDuring the famous Winter War of 1939–1940, the Finnish perseverance in the face of the invasion by the Soviet Union popularized this word in English for a generation.\nIn what may have been the first use of \"sisu\" in the English language, on 8 January 1940, \"Time\" magazine reported:\nEven in 2009, \"sisu\" has been described as so essential to the Finnish national character that \"to be a real Finn\" you must have it: \"willpower, tenacity, persistency.\"\n\nSingled out for kudos for this attribute was \"Finland's wiry old peasant President, Kyösti Kallio—73 years old and full of \"sisu\" (courage)—last week thought up a new scheme to get supplies for his country.\"\nIt was also used to describe the Finnish stubbornness in sticking to its loose alliance with The Third Reich from 1941 to 1944 (in the war against the Soviet Union, which had attacked Finland on 30 November 1939):\nDuring the 1952 Summer Olympics, \"sisu\" was further described in the context of the continuing Cold War looming over the Finnish capital city of Helsinki:\nWell into the 1960s, \"sisu\" was used to describe the Finnish resistance to the invasion of 20 to 30 years prior and its continuing discontents. In 1960, Austin Goodrich's book, \"Study in Sisu: Finland's Fight for Independence\", was published by Ballantine. Also in 1960, a notable reviewer of Griffin Taylor's novel, \"Mortlake\", wrote:\nIn 2004, Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia, described his company's \"guts\" by using the word \"sisu\":\nA Finnish heavy metal rock singer injured himself, without noticing, at a concert, to which a reviewer wrote:\nThe concept is widely known in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is home to a large concentration of Americans of Finnish descent. This has extended to include a popular bumper sticker saying \"got sisu?\" or simply \"SISU\".\nIn 2010, a 63-year-old Yooper named Joe Paquette Jr. of Munising, Michigan, walked 425 miles to the Detroit Lions training facility to bring the spirit of \"sisu\" to the team.\n\nThe non-profit documentary \"SISU: Family, Love and Perseverance from Finland to America\" was made by Finnish-American filmmaker Marko Albrecht. The documentary looks at sisu through a powerful profile of his late mother, his Finnish-American family, and his uncle Heikki's tragic fight against pancreatic cancer. The film has been a called a time-capsule of modern Finnish-American life.\n\nIn a 2008 episode of Top Gear, F1 racer Mika Häkkinen described \"sisu\" to James May:\n\nDue to its cultural significance, \"sisu\" is a common element of brand names in Finland.\nFor example, there are Sisu trucks (and Sisu armored vehicles), the icebreaker MS \"Sisu\", a brand of strong-tasting pastilles manufactured by Leaf and Suomen Sisu, a Finnish nationalist organisation with connections to other far-right groups.\n\nSisu is also a male name with increasing popularity. More than 2,000 Finnish men have this name, most of them being born after 2010. The son of The Dudesons's Jukka Hilden is called Sisu.\n\nGlobally, there are several fitness-related organizations and endurance sports teams such as the Sisu Project based in Haverhill and Worcester, Massachusetts, USA that carry the name \"sisu\" and base their philosophy on the characteristics included in the concept \"sisu\", including courage, integrity, honesty, and determination.\n\nMount Sisu is the name of a mountain first ascended by mountain climbers Veikka Gustafsson and Patrick Degerman in the Antarctic.\n\n\"Sisu\" is also the name of a London-based hedge-fund, operated by several directors including Joy Seppala. The firm bought the football club Coventry City FC in 2007.\n\nIn Norway there is a seafood company named Sisu Seafood Norway AS that exports Norwegian seafoods.\n\nOn the Western end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the SISU Ski Fest is a popular annual event, highlighting a 21- and 42-kilometer cross-country ski race \"finishing\" in historic downtown Ironwood.\n\nAccording to the Finnish Population Register Centre's name service, over 2,000 Finnish men have the first name \"Sisu\". The name gained popularity especially in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nIn season 2 of McLaren's animated program Tooned Sisu is stated as a planet and the true origin of two-time Formula One Drivers' Champion Mika Häkkinen (and possibly 2007 Drivers' Champion Kimi Räikkönen as well based on a Sisu scene near the end of the episode in question).

The dish is named after Zuo Zongtang (also romanized \"Tso Tsung-t'ang\"), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader, although there is no recorded connection to him nor is the dish known in Hunan, Zuo's home province.\n\nThe dish has been associated with Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t'ang) (1812–1885), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader from Hunan Province, but Zuo could not have eaten the dish or known of it. The dish is found neither in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, nor in Xiangyin County, where Zuo was born. Moreover, Zuo's descendants, who are still living in Xiangyin County, when interviewed, say that they have never heard of such a dish.\n\nThere are several stories concerning the origin of the dish. Eileen Yin-Fei Lo states in her book \"The Chinese Kitchen\" that the dish originates from a simple Hunan chicken dish and that the reference to \"\"Zongtang\"\" was not a reference to Zuo Zongtang's given name, but rather a reference to the homonym \"\"zongtang\"\", meaning \"ancestral meeting hall\". Consistent with this interpretation, the dish name is sometimes (but considerably less commonly) found in Chinese as 左宗棠雞 (\"Chung tong gai\" is transliterated from Jyutping; \"Zuǒ Zōngtáng jī\" is transliterated from Hanyu Pinyin).\n\nThe dish or its variants are known by a number of greatly variant names, including: \n\nFuchsia Dunlop argues that the recipe was invented by Taiwan-based Hunan cuisine chef Peng Chang-kuei, who had been an apprentice of Cao Jingchen (), a leading early 20th-century Chinese chef. Peng was the Nationalist government's banquet chef and fled with Kuomintang forces to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. There he continued his career as official chef until 1973, when he moved to New York to open a restaurant. That was where Peng started inventing new dishes and modifying traditional ones. One new dish, General Tso's chicken, was originally prepared without sugar and subsequently altered to suit the tastes of \"non-Hunanese people\". The popularity of the dish has now led to it being \"adopted\" by local Hunanese chefs and food writers, perhaps as an acknowledgment of the dish's unique status, upon which the international reputation of Hunanese cuisine was largely based. When Peng opened a restaurant in Hunan in the 1990s introducing General Tso's chicken, the restaurant closed without success, as the locals found the dish too sweet.\n\nPeng's Restaurant on East 44th Street in New York City claims that it was the first restaurant in the city to serve General Tso's chicken. Since the dish (and cuisine) was new, Peng made it the house speciality in spite of the dish's commonplace ingredients. A review of Peng's in 1977 mentions that their \"General Tso's chicken was a stir-fried masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature\".\n\nPeng died from pneumonia in November 2016 at 98 years old.\n\nNew York's Shun Lee Palaces, located at East (155 E. 55th St.) and West (43 W. 65th St.), also claims that it was the first restaurant to serve General Tso's chicken and that it was invented by a Chinese immigrant chef named T. T. Wang in 1972. Michael Tong, owner of New York's Shun Lee Palaces, says \"We opened the first Hunanese restaurant in the whole country, and the four dishes we offered you will see on the menu of practically every Hunanese restaurant in America today. They all copied from us.\"\n\nIt has also been argued that the two stories can be somewhat reconciled in that the current General Tso's chicken recipe — where the meat is crispy fried — was introduced by Chef Wang but as \"General Ching's chicken\", a name which still has trace appearances on menus on the Internet (the identity of its namesake \"General Ching\" is, however, unclear); whereas the name \"General Tso's chicken\" can be traced to Chef Peng, who cooked it in a different way.\n\nThese competing claims are discussed in the 2014 documentary film \"The Search for General Tso\", which also traces how the history of Chinese immigration into the USA parallels the development of a unique Chinese-American or American Chinese cuisine.\n\nTraditional basic ingredients include:\n\n\nThe dish may be served under different names. For example, at the United States Naval Academy, the dish is served in the main mess hall, King Hall, as \"Admiral Tso's Chicken\", reflecting a nautical theme.\n\nThe Taiwanese restaurant Peng Chang-kuei also serves the dish and is credited by some sources as the inventor of the dish. Differences between this \"original\" dish and that commonly encountered in North America are that it is not sweet in flavor, the chicken is cooked with its skin and that soy sauce plays a much more prominent role.\n\nA typical restaurant serving of General Tso's chicken may include up to 1,300 kilocalories, 11 grams of saturated fat and 3,200 milligrams of sodium as well as exceed 300 mg of cholesterol. One serving will typically be about 4 oz. (approximately 100 grams) of chicken thigh meat which contains 20-30 grams of protein, greater than 30% of the daily recommended niacin needs and over 15% of the recommended B6, phosphorus and zinc needs.\n\n\n"}

It is sold primarily in European and Asian markets.\n\nA drink with the same name but different formulation (containing ginseng and higher quantities of caffeine) was sold in the United States until it was renamed \"Pepsi Zero Sugar\" in late 2016.\n\nPepsi Max debuted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy in April 1993. The rollout was expanded to Ireland the following September, and to France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands the following December. By the end of 1994, Pepsi Max was sold in approximately twenty countries. By the end of 1995, that figure had more than doubled. The product remained unavailable in the United States until 2006 (the US, PepsiCo's home market, and the largest consumer of carbonated soft drinks), where one of its principal ingredients had not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The ingredient—acesulfame potassium—is combined with aspartame to provide the beverage's sweetness, whereas some other diet colas are sweetened by aspartame alone.\n\nIn early-2005, Pepsi Max Twist (with added lemon-lime flavour) joined the UK and Australian product line. In autumn 2005, \"Pepsi Max Punch\" was marketed in the UK for the festive season. Containing ginger and cinnamon, the product was similar in flavour to Pepsi Holiday Spice, a sugar-sweetened variety of Pepsi that was marketed in the US one year earlier. In late-2005 and early-2006, a coffee-flavoured variety was introduced in France, Finland, Ireland, Norway, and the UK. Known as \"Pepsi Max Cappuccino\" (\"Pepsi Max Coffee Cino\" in the UK), the product was prefigured by the similar Pepsi Kona (briefly test-marketed in the US in 1996) and Pepsi Tarik, available in Malaysia since 2005.\n\nPepsi Max was introduced to South Korea, Bulgaria, and the Philippines in 2006, as well as being reintroduced into Argentina in the spring of 2006 after being phased out after its launch in 1994. As well as this, Pepsi Max was introduced into Brazil, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and the UAE during early 2007.\n\nIn October 2008, Pepsi announced it would be redesigning its logo and re-branding many of its products. Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Max all use lower-case fonts for name brands, Mountain Dew was renamed \"Mtn Dew\", and Diet Pepsi Max was re-branded as Pepsi Max. The brand's blue and red globe trademark became a series of \"smiles\", with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product. The new imagery is being used. In the case of Pepsi Max, besides renaming of the drink its international name, the logo has a large \"smile\" likely to emphasize the North American drink's \"Wake up people!\" advertising campaign, and also uses black in the bottom half of the globe as opposed to the more standard royal blue. The new lower-case font used on Pepsi's products is reminiscent of the font used in Diet Pepsi's logo from the 1960s to the mid-1980s. The website for the \"Wake up people!\" campaign now redirects to the Pepsi Refresh Project. It is expected that the version of Pepsi Max outside North America will adopt the new logo used by its US–Canada counterpart; this has now occurred in Australia. In the UK, the cans now have the \"Pepsi\" text and the new Pepsi globe (with the normal Pepsi \"smile\" and the blue bottom half, as opposed to the black half used in the US) but the \"Max\" is in the previous style.\n\nA Pepsi Max Lime version was released in the United States in February 2010 under the name \"Pepsi Max Cease Fire\" It was introduced in the UK in late-2011. It was cross-promoted with a new flavor series of Doritos chips called \"3rd Degree Burn\". In July 2010, Pepsi began to move its North American branding for Pepsi Max to match its global branding. It now carries a Max typography similar to that used worldwide, and rolled out a new slogan: \"Zero Calories. Maximum Pepsi Taste\". Its formula has not changed. In May 2011, Pepsi introduced the drink to Spain. In 2016, the drink was introduced to Venezuela. In 2017 Pepsi Max was launched in Costa Rica\n\nIn 2017, the drink was reintroduced in Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, India, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey and Ukraine as Pepsi Black. As of 2017 it is available as Pepsi Max in Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.\n\nRecent UK/Australia Pepsi Max television advertisements have featured the taglines \"Maximum taste, no sugar\" and \"Don't worry, there's no sugar.\" Some have incorporated extreme sports and video games such as Motocross Mania in an attempt to appeal to young men (in contrast to other diet cola drinks, which tend to target young women). The British advertising campaign involved retouched versions of the American \"Do the Dew\" commercials for Mountain Dew (A variant of which is sold in the UK ), rebranded as \"Live life to the Max\".\nCoca-Cola Zero, a sugar-free cola from the Coca-Cola Company, is marketed in a similar manner. In the UK some Coke Zero advertising alluded to Pepsi Max, leading to a robust counter-campaign by Pepsi extolling the virtues of the concept of \"maximum\" over that of \"zero.\"\n\nIn early-2005, the North American drink Pepsi ONE was revised, with Splenda brand sucralose replacing the aspartame ingredient.\n\nIn December 2008, advertisements for Pepsi Max that depicted a cartoon character committing suicide were run in a German lifestyle magazine, which resulted in a scandal and revocation of the ads. One of the three ads featured a bean-shaped character simultaneously shooting himself in the head, with a noose round his neck, and poison in his other hand. The character is supposed to be \"one very very very lonely calorie\".\n\nBeginning in early 1994, an entirely different Pepsi Max was marketed in Canada. Now regarded as a precursor to Pepsi Edge, it was sweetened with a combination of aspartame and high fructose corn syrup. As a result, it contained two-thirds fewer calories than full-sugar colas (including regular Pepsi), but more calories than conventional diet/light colas (or the version of Pepsi Max sold elsewhere). The Canadian product was discontinued in 2002; the Diet Pepsi Max product introduced in 2008 has no direct relationship to the earlier formulation.\n\n\n\n"}

The product is aged for a minimum of four years (which is more than the two year minimum to be called 'straight' bourbon, but is the minimum requirement for a straight whiskey that does not have an age statement on the label). It has been ranked as one of the world's best selling whiskey brands.\n\nAlthough bottled in Bardstown, the product is distilled at the Heaven Hill distillery in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe \"standard issue\" Evan Williams bourbon is sold as the mass-market \"Black Label\" variety, which has been described as \"something that's cheap and doesn't taste bad\". The company also bottles several other expressions, including a \"White Label\" that is bottled in bond, an \"Evan Williams 1783\" bourbon that is produced in more limited quantities and has been described as an \"affordable, value-packed bourbon\", and a nine-year-old single barrel bourbon sold in vintage-dated bottles sealed with black wax. Occasionally available in some regions is a \"Green Label\" variety that is 80 proof and represents a younger, light-bodied version of the bourbon found in \"Black Label\" bottles at a more affordable price.\n\nAs of June 21, 2010, Evan Williams was the second largest-selling brand of Kentucky straight bourbon (following the market leading Jim Beam brand) and had the fastest-growing market share among the top-volume American whiskey brands (with a 12.4% sales growth rate), according to a press release issued by the producer citing A.C. Nielsen Scantrack 2010 data.\n\nEvan Williams Black is 43% alc/vol (86 U.S. proof), unlike some popular whiskeys which are bottled at the statutory minimum of 40% alc/vol (80 proof).\n\nEvan Williams was a Welsh immigrant, who was born in Dale, Pembrokeshire, but emigrated to the United States towards the end of the 18th century. Williams settled in Kentucky and began distilling in 1783, in what is now Louisville, Kentucky. A historical marker in Louisville (depicted in photo at right) says the site was Kentucky's first commercial distillery. Williams was elected to serve as the first wharf master of Louisville in 1797.\n\nThis heritage is emphasized on the bottle label of the best selling variant, the black label, which bears the inscriptions \"Since 1783\" and \"Kentucky's 1st distiller\". However, the inscriptions should not be construed as indicating that the brand has continuously existed since the time of the historic distillery. The modern whiskey brand was established in the mid-1900s and has no direct connection to the historic distiller.\n\nMoreover, historian Michael Veach of the Filson Historical Society has stated that key details of the historical claims about Williams appear to be false. Veach said that the assertion that Williams was Kentucky's first distiller did not appear until an 1892 publication by Reuben Durrett, more than a century after the fact. He also said that the dating is disproved by a record of Williams traveling from London to Philadelphia in May 1794, showing that Williams could only have begun his distillery substantially later. Veach indicated that the true identity of Kentucky's first distiller may never really be known, since record-keeping about such matters was poor, and there are others that seem more likely as candidates for first distiller, including Jacob Myers and brothers Joseph and Samuel Davis. Records reportedly indicate that Myers and the Davis brothers both arrived in 1779.\n\nVarieties of whiskey using the Evan Williams brand name include the following:\nSeveral liqueurs are also produced under the Evan Williams brand, including:\n\nThe whiskey and its history is featured in the \"Evan Williams Bourbon Experience\", a tourist attraction in Louisville that is part of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.\n\nOn February 16, 2011, the \"Black Label\" expression tied with 100 proof Very Old Barton as \"Best Buy Whisk(e)y of the Year\" in the 17th Annual Malt Advocate Whisky Awards.\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy said \"The Black Label smells of deep vanilla and cherry and is a bit smoother than the green label.\"\n\n"}

Its current distillery facility, called the Heaven Hill Bernheim distillery, is in Louisville, Kentucky. It is the seventh-largest alcohol supplier in the United States, the second-largest holder of bourbon whiskey inventory in the world, the largest, independent, family-owned and operated producer and marketer of distilled spirits in the United States, and the only large family-owned distillery company headquartered in Kentucky (not counting Brown-Forman Corporation, which is publicly traded but more than two-thirds family-controlled, or Sazerac Company, which is family-owned but headquartered in Louisiana).\n\nHeaven Hill was founded by several investors shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in 1935, including a prominent distiller, Joseph L. Beam, and a member of the Shapira family. As the company developed, the five brothers of the Shapira family bought out the other investors. Joe Beam remained as Master Distiller, along with his youngest son, Harry. Descendants of the Shapira brothers own and operate the company today.\n\nAll of the Master Distillers at Heaven Hill since its founding have been members of the Beam family. The original Master Distiller was Joseph L. Beam, Jim Beam's first cousin. He was followed by his son, Harry, who was followed by Earl Beam, the son of Jim Beam's brother, Park. Earl Beam was succeeded by the current Master Distillers, Parker Beam and his son, Craig Beam.\n\nThe original name was \"Old Heavenhill Springs\" distillery. The company was founded as a bourbon distillery, and for most of its existence has concentrated on its flagship bourbon labels, Evan Williams and Elijah Craig. In the past two decades the company has expanded its portfolio, acquiring brands or obtaining import rights for gins, malt whiskey, vodkas, and other drinks.\n\nOn November 7, 1996, Heaven Hill's production plant (registered plant DSP-KY-31) was almost completely destroyed by fire. The fire started in an aging warehouse and spread to other buildings and vehicles. 90,000 barrels of flammable bourbon were consumed. A \"river of fire\" flowed from the warehouses.\n\nFrom one account of the fire: \"Flames leapt hundreds of feet into the air and lit the sky throughout the night. Witnesses reported seeing whiskey barrels explode and rocket across the sky like shooting stars ... a two-mile long stretch of the creek that supplied process water to the distillery was set ablaze for a brief time.\"\n\nThe company survived the next several years through the provision of production capacity by its fellow local bourbon labels, Brown-Forman and Jim Beam, until its purchase and adaptation of the Bernheim distillery in Louisville (registered plant DSP-KY-1,) from Diageo in 1999. While fermenting, mashing, and distilling occurs at the new distillery, aging, bottling, and shipping still occur in Bardstown.\n\nWith the 2003 acquisition of distribution rights to Hpnotiq, Heaven Hill greatly expanded their product base beyond bourbon. Hpnotiq is now the fourth highest selling imported liqueur in the US. While bourbon is still its main focus, Heaven Hill now distributes a wide variety of different products.\n\nThe Heaven Hill company strongly emphasizes the history and traditions of bourbon in its public relations, highlighting the company's location in the historical home of bourbon-making and its status as the only such company still under local ownership. In 2004, the Heaven Hill Distilleries Bourbon Heritage Center was opened on the old distillery grounds, providing historical exhibits and guided tours of the plant. The company also hosts the annual Kentucky Bourbon Festival, and several of the company's brands are named after famous local distillers.\n\nSince 2010, Heaven Hill has invested more than $100m in distillery expansions, warehouse construction, and Bourbon tourism. In November 2018, Heaven Hill announced a $65m multi-year investment into expanding operations, which includes a renovation of the Bourbon Heritage Center. \n\nAs noted, Heaven Hill's traditional product has been bourbon; however, the company now oversees a broad range of labels.

The distillery is located near Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. It offers tours and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.\n\nIn 1891, Thomas Ripy built the Old Hickory Distillery in Tyrone, Kentucky, near Lawrenceburg, on the former site of the Old Moore Distillery. After Prohibition, the Ripy family (Thomas had died in 1902) repaired the distillery and began to again produce bourbon. The Ripys sold the bourbon produced at this distillery to various wholesalers who bottled bourbon under their own brands. Austin Nichols was one of these wholesalers. \n\nThe \"Wild Turkey\" brand is said to have arisen after an Austin Nichols executive, Thomas McCarthy, took some warehouse samples on a wild turkey hunting trip in 1940. The bourbon proved so popular among his friends they continued to ask him for \"that wild turkey bourbon.\" Austin Nichols began to bottle Wild Turkey in 1942. \n\nThe Ripys were bought out in 1949 by Robert and Alvin Gould.\n\nFor three decades after introducing Wild Turkey, Austin Nichols remained a non-distiller producer—bottling bourbon purchased on the open market under their Wild Turkey brand. Much of this whiskey was purchased from the Ripys/Gould distillery in Tyrone. In 1971, Austin Nichols purchased the facility (then known as the Boulevard Distillery) and changed the name to the Wild Turkey Distillery.\n\nIn 1980, the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand were purchased by Pernod Ricard.\n\nOn May 9, 2000, a fire destroyed a seven-story aging warehouse at the company in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the woods on fire, causing limestone deposits to explode. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg's water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. The EPA and the Coast Guard's Gulf Strike Team aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges. The company paid $256,000 to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife in an effort to restore the fish population in the river.\n\nIn 2009, the Campari Group acquired the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand from Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn 2011, Wild Turkey began to be distilled at a newly constructed facility near the old distillery. The new distillery sits where the old bottling facility was previously located. It was bottled by the Austin Nichols division of Campari Group, until the division was renamed.\n\nIn 2013, Campari opened a new bottling facility at the Wild Turkey Distillery. For the previous 13 years Wild Turkey had been bottled offsite in Indiana and, later, Arkansas. In addition to the Wild Turkey products, Campari's SKYY vodka is also bottled there after being shipped from the Illinois distillery.\n\nThe Lawrenceburg distillery currently bottles its bourbon and rye under the brands of \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Russell's Reserve\".\nWild Turkey\n\nRussell's Reserve (named for Jimmy Russell, Wild Turkey's master distiller) \n\nFlavored\nIn 2012, Wild Turkey 101 earned an 'Editor's Choice' award from \"Whisky Magazine\". An aggregator from various \"expert\" body reviews places the 101 Single Barrel in the 97th percentile of all rated bourbons.\n\nIn 2011, an advertisement video called \"Give 'em the Bird\" was featured on the product's web site, Facebook page, and YouTube page that prominently included a middle finger gesture and referred to other (non-existing) advertising videos featuring a nun and an adult blow-up doll.\nIn August 2011, the review board of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), of which Campari USA is a member, ruled that the advertisement violated the council's code of ethical practices and said that \"the gesture is indecent and the advertisement fails to meet contemporary standards of good taste\". According to DISCUS, the company disagreed with the board's interpretation but agreed to withdraw the advertisement.\n\nThe Australian version of the advertisement features the famous rock musician (and self-confessed former alcoholic) Jimmy Barnes.\n\nSince then, the company has continued to use the \"Give 'em the Bird\" slogan and middle finger gesturing in additional advertising and promotional activities. In November 2012, Jimmy Russell, the Wild Turkey Master Distiller, publicly called for U.S. President Barack Obama to \"Give us the bird\", as a way of offering to provide a home for that year's White House Thanksgiving Day turkey (which is traditionally \"pardoned\" by the president) – saying the turkey would become the brand's official \"spokesbird\".\n\nIn 2016, Matthew McConaughey was hired as creative director and celebrity spokesman for Wild Turkey's latest campaign, to bring in more women and international customers.\n\nWild Turkey is known for being a favorite drink of journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and is mentioned in his 1972 book \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" (as well as the film of the same name), and the 1973 book \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72\". In Stephen King's book \"It\", when asked what the bar whiskey is, the bartender replies, \"For everyone else in this dump it's Four Roses, but for you I think it's Wild Turkey.\" David Foster Wallace's novel \"Infinite Jest\" has James Incandenza as an alcoholic filmmaker and tennis academy head who drinks Wild Turkey, as well as being referenced as Wallace's drink of choice in his biography, \"Every Love Story is a Ghost Story\". In Scott Sigler's science fiction book \"Infected\", main character Perry Dawsey is described several times as drinking Wild Turkey. In Patrick Neate's 2004 book \"City of Tiny Lights\" the private investigator anti-hero and narrator of the tale, Tommy Akhtar, subsists on a diet of mostly Wild Turkey and Benson and Hedges cigarettes, referring to them as \"Benny and the Turk\". In Adrian Edmondson's 1995 novel \"The Gobbler\", the hard-drinking central protagonist, Julian Mann, has a penchant for Wild Turkey, particularly in combination with pints of lager.\n\nThe bourbon is the drink of choice for characters in \"\" and \"The Cassandra Crossing\" (which are both directed by George Pan Cosmatos), \"Rush\", \"Mystic River (film)\", \"In the Heat of the Night (film)\", \"Silver Bullet\", \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Bad Lieutenant\", \"Barb Wire\", \"The Eiger Sanction\", \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", \"The Punisher\", \"Where the Buffalo Roam\", and \"The Guardian\".

On the season 2 episode \"Sweetums\" of Parks and Recreation, Ron Swanson mentions his old man used to put Wild Turkey on his Cornflakes, while explaining why his family has a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol. The title character in \"Jessica Jones\" is frequently shown drinking from a bottle of Wild Turkey 101, while ads for Wild Turkey can be seen on the walls of Josie's Bar in \"Daredevil\".\n\n\"Wild Turkey\" was the title of a 1982 top-ten country single for singer Lacy J.

The current Old Crow product uses the same mash bill and yeast as Jim Beam, but is aged for a shorter period of time and mixed to a more lenient taste profile before bottling.\n\nThe Old Crow brand has a venerable history as one of Kentucky's earliest bourbons. Old Crow is aged in barrels for a minimum of three years, and in the United States is 80 proof while the slightly higher quality, but still inexpensive Old Crow Reserve is aged for a minimum of four years and is 86 proof.\n\nJames C. Crow, a Scottish immigrant, started distilling what would come to be Old Crow in Frankfort, Kentucky, in the 1830s. Reportedly a very skilled distiller, he made whiskey for various employers, which was sold as \"Crow\" or, as it aged, \"Old Crow\" – and the brand acquired its reputation from the latter. He died in 1856, and while W.A. Gaines and Company kept the name and continued to distill the bourbon according to his recipe, the original distillation formula died with its creator. The last remaining stock of Old Crow (of which there seemed to have been quite a bit) acquired near-legendary status, and offering drinks of it reportedly secured a re-election for Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn, senator for Kentucky. A dispute over ownership of the name \"Old Crow\" was decided in 1915 in favor of the Gaines company. Old Crow's logo, a crow perched atop grains of barley, is rumored to stem as a symbol bridging the North and South during the Civil War. A Pennsylvania brigade training at State College, Pennsylvania thought Old Crow was the only good thing to ever come out of the south. Fearing never being able to drink Old Crow again, the soldiers wrote Lincoln proclaiming \"We must not let the fine gentleman Old Crow escape. Remember Mr. President, the crow with the sharpest talons holds on to barley forever.\" After the War the logo was changed from a picture of James Crow to the current crow holding onto barley.\n\nAlthough the whiskey had been, at one time, the top selling bourbon in the United States, it underwent a swift decline in the second half of the twentieth century. A production error in the amount of \"setback\" (the portion of spent mash added to a new batch in the sour mash process) negatively affected the taste of the whiskey, and the distiller's inability or unwillingness to correct it led to many drinkers moving on to other brands. Parent company National Distillers would be sold to Jim Beam in 1987; the Old Crow recipe and distillery were not kept and the product after this would be a three-year-old bourbon based on the Jim Beam mashbill.\n\nBesides Blackburn, many American politicians have declared their love for Old Crow. It has been said that it was the drink of choice for American general and later 18th President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. An apocryphal story about Grant's drinking has the general's critics going to President Abraham Lincoln, charging the military man with being a drunk. Lincoln is supposed to have replied, \"By the way, gentlemen, can either of you tell me where General Grant procures his whiskey? Because, if I can find out, I will send every general in the field a barrel of it!\"\n\nConfederate General Jubal Early was also a fan of Old Crow.\n\nAnother famous politician who preferred Old Crow was Henry Clay, of Kentucky, who was even featured in Old Crow advertisements.\n\nWorld War II \"triple ace\" Bud Anderson named his P-51 Mustang \"Old Crow\", after the whiskey. \n\nOld Crow is said to have been the favorite bourbon of American writer Mark Twain. Journalist Hunter S. Thompson liked it. Twain reportedly visited the distillery in the 1880s, and Old Crow advertised this heavily; John C. Gerber sees in this commercial exploitation a sign of Twain's continuing popularity. As for Thompson, the frequent occurrences of the drink in his writing, semi-autobiographical as well as fictional have led to similar associations. The manufacturer actively pursued such publicity: in 1955, they took out an ad in \"College English\", the journal of the National Council of Teachers of English, offering $250 for every literary reference to their product.\n\nIn the 1903 book \"The Log Of A Cowboy\" by Andy Adams, the cook goes to Abilene for supplies and also brings back a box of cigars and \"several bottles of Old Crow\".\n\nIt is mentioned by Japanese author Murakami Haruki in \"The end of the world and the marvelous land\".\n\nIn his 1998 HBO special \"Driven to Drink\", comedian Paul F. Tompkins said \"Now if you've never had Old Crow, then you've never accidentally sprayed hairspray into your mouth.\"\n\nThroughout “Up a Road Slowly” Irene Hunt’s 1966 Newbery Award-winning novel, Uncle Haskell drinks copious quantities of Old Crow, taking the empty bottles in a golf bag to bury them at a creek. He claims the Old Crow is rare French wine, so the children begin referring to it as \"Le\" \"Vieux Corbeau\".\n\nIn the 1953 John Wayne Movie, \"Trouble Along The Way\", Wayne's character, Steve Williams, is seen to be clearly drinking Old Crow in a bar.\n\nMentions in popular music have included the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "910272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=910272", "title": "Cupcake", "text": "Cupcake\n\nA cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno-English: bun; Australian English: fairy cake or patty cake) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, icing and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.\n\nThe earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in 1796, when a recipe for \"a light cake to bake in small cups\" was written in \"American Cookery\" by Amelia Simmons. The earliest extant documentation of the term \"cupcake\" itself was in \"Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's \"Receipts\" cookbook.\n\nIn the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term \"cup cake\" or \"cupcake\". In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of \"cupcake\" is now given to any small, round cake that is about the size of a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate icing.\n\nThe other kind of \"cup cake\" referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as \"1234 cakes\" or \"quarter cakes\", so called because they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake.\n\nThe names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; \"cup cake\" uses a volume measurement, and \"pound cake\" uses a weight measurement.\n\nA standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.\n\nBecause their small size is more efficient for heat conduction, cupcakes bake much faster than a normal layered cake. During baking, the volume of the batter initially increases due to the production of carbon dioxide, then decreases upon cooling due to the release of leavening gases.\n\nCupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations. They may be filled with frosting, fruit, or pastry cream. For bakers making a small number of filled cupcakes, this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole in the top of the cupcake. Another method is to just insert the pastry bag in the middle of the cupcake. In commercial bakeries, the filling may be injected using a syringe. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for special occasions.\n\n\nOriginally, cupcakes were baked in heavy pottery cups. Some bakers still use individual ramekins, small coffee mugs, large tea cups, or other small ovenproof pottery-type dishes for baking cupcakes.\n\nCupcakes are usually baked in muffin tins. These pans are most often made from metal, with or without a non-stick surface, and generally have six or twelve depressions or \"cups\". They may also be made from stoneware, silicone rubber, or other materials. A standard size cup is in diameter and holds about , although pans for both miniature and jumbo size cupcakes exist. Specialty pans may offer many different sizes and shapes.\nIndividual patty cases, or cupcake liners, may be used in baking. These are typically round sheets of thin paper pressed into a round, fluted cup shape. Liners can facilitate the easy removal of the cupcake from the tin after baking, keep the cupcake more moist, and reduce the effort needed to clean the pan. The use of liners is also considered a more sanitary option when cupcakes are being passed from hand to hand. Like cupcake pans, several sizes of paper liners are available, from miniature to jumbo.\n\nIn addition to paper, cupcake liners may be made from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on their own, foil and silicone liners can also be used on a flat baking sheet, which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently for baking without a cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate the strength of a single foil cup.\n\nLiners, which are also called \"paper cases\", come in a variety of sizes. Slightly different sizes are considered \"standard\" in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly in diameter at the base and tall. Standard-size cases range from in diameter at the base and are tall. Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.\n\nIn the early 21st century, a trend for cupcake shops, which are specialized bakeries that sell little or nothing except cupcakes, developed in the United States, playing off of the sense of nostalgia evoked by the cakes. In New York City, cupcake shops like Magnolia Bakery gained publicity in their appearances on popular television shows like HBO's \"Sex and the City\".\n\nCrumbs Bake Shop, a publicly traded business running the largest cupcake shop chain in the U.S., reached its peak stock price in 2011. Declining sales, due to competition from locally owned mom-and-pop specialty stores as well as increased competition from grocery stores, caused a sharp decline in the company's prospects and stock price in 2013.\n\nGeorgetown Cupcake was the first cupcakery to open in Washington, D.C. The cupcake shop gained widespread publicity after the 2010 premier of TLC's \"DC Cupcakes\", a six-part reality show about the shop and its owners, sisters Sophie LaMontagne and Katherine Kallinis.\n\nBased in Beverly Hills, California, Sprinkles Cupcakes is owned by Candace Nelson, who is also a star judge on the Food Network's \"Cupcake Wars\", and her husband, Charles Nelson. Sprinkles is the first cupcake shop to debut a cupcake ATM, which could hold up to 350 cupcakes at one time.\n\nCupcakes are sometimes used to celebrate and illustrate specific events or themes.\n\n\n"}

Eggs may also sometimes be used as an ingredient, with cream of tartar and baking soda added to leaven the dough. Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be crisp or soft depending on the ingredients used.\n\nSnickerdoodles are often referred to as \"sugar cookies\". However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon.\n\n\"The Joy of Cooking\" claims that snickerdoodles are probably German in origin, and that the name is a corruption of the German word , a Palatine variety of \"schnecken\". It is also possible that the name is simply a nonsense word with no particular meaning, originating from a New England tradition of whimsical cookie names.\n\nThe snickerdoodle is a very common cookie in Canada and the United States, but is relatively unknown in other countries. The cookie is common to Mennonite and Amish communities and was a favorite treat of the Indiana poet, James Whitcomb Riley.\n\nIn more recent times, the Snickerdoodle cookie has transformed into a popular flavor of desserts, sweets, drinks, etc. Big brands have taken the simple dessert and turned them into their own original products. For example, General Mills created a Snickerdoodle flavored Chex Mix Muddy Buddies to their snack line. During the 2014 holiday season, Dunkin' Donuts unveiled a Snickerdoodle Cookie Latte on their holiday menu. In addition to a Snickerdoodle latte, Nestlé Coffee-Mate introduced their take on the cookie in the form of a coffee creamer. Brands such as Braum's Ice Cream and Prairie Farms have dedicated an ice cream flavor to the popular cookie.\n\nThe Snickerdoodle scent has also become popular in non-edible products. In 2014, Bath and Body Works launched their \"Made with Love\" holiday collection. This collection included a Snickerdoodle scented candle. However, this scent failed to gain popularity. In addition, the skin care company Philosophy, Inc. released a Snickerdoodle scented body wash and shampoo in their \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\" collection. Similar to the Bath and Body Works candle, this scent has been discontinued since it is unable to be found on retailer sites besides resellers like Amazon and eBay.\n\nThe term snickerdoodle has enough cultural significance and recognizability for it to be appropriated in product naming by brands engaged in activities unrelated to food. A Santa Clara, California, software company calls itself Snickerdoodle Software because \"just like the snickerdoodle cookies,\" a company statement explains, \"we believe the apps should be simple, classic and delicious.\"\n\nA small single board computer called Snickerdoodle was introduced by krtkl inc. in October 2015.\n\n\n"}

Modern commercially mass-produced potato farls, however, are often rectangular in form.\n\nIn Scotland today, the word is used less than in Northern Ireland, but a farl can be a quarter piece of a large flat scone, bannock, or oatcake.

{"id": "914267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914267", "title": "Possessive", "text": "Possessive\n\nA possessive form (abbreviated ) is a word or grammatical construction used to indicate a relationship of possession in a broad sense. This can include strict ownership, or a number of other types of relation to a greater or lesser degree analogous to it.\n\nMost European languages feature possessive forms associated with personal pronouns, like the English \"my\", \"mine\", \"your\", \"yours\", \"his\" and so on. There are two main ways in which these can be used (and a variety of terminologies for each):\n\nSome languages, including English, also have possessive forms derived from nouns or noun phrases, such as \"Jane's\", \"cows' \" and \"nobody else's\". These can be used in the same two ways as the pronoun-derived forms: adjectivally, as in \"Jane's office\"; and substantivally, as in \"that one is Jane's\".\n\nPossessives are sometimes regarded as a grammatical case (the possessive case), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the genitive case, or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a possessed case, used to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the Finnish \"taloni\" (\"my house\"), where \"talo\" means \"house\" and the suffix \"-ni\" means \"my\".\n\nThe concepts of possessive forms and genitive forms are sometimes conflated, although they are not exactly the same. The genitive form, which does not exist in modern English as an inflection, represents an \"of\" relationship, which may or may not be possessive; in other words, the possessive is a subset of genitive. For example, the genitive form \"speed of the car\" is equivalent to the possessive form \"the car's speed\". However, the genitive form \"pack of dogs\" is not the same as the possessive form \"dogs' pack\" (though it is the same as \"dog pack\", which is not possessive).\n\nThe glossing abbreviation or may be used to indicate possessive forms.\n\nIt is common for languages to have independent possessive determiners (adjectives) and possessive pronouns corresponding to the personal pronouns of the language. For example, to the English personal pronouns \"I\", \"you\", \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"we\", \"they\", there correspond the respective possessive determiners \"my\", \"your\", \"his\", \"her\", \"its\", \"our\" and \"their\", and the (substantival) possessive pronouns \"mine\", \"yours\", \"his\", \"hers\", \"its\" (rare), \"ours\" and \"theirs\". In some instances there is no difference in form between the determiner and the pronoun; examples include the English \"his\" (and \"its\"), and informal Finnish \"meidän\" (meaning either \"our\" or \"ours\").\n\nIn some languages, possessive determiners are subject to agreement with the noun they modify, and possessive pronouns may be subject to agreement with their antecedent, in terms of relevant categories of gender, number and case. For example, French has \"mon\", \"ma\", \"mes\", respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English \"my\", as well as the various possessive pronoun forms \"le mien\", \"la mienne\", \"les mien(ne)s\" corresponding to English \"mine\".\n\nSince personal pronouns may also agree in number and gender with their own antecedent or referent, the possessive forms may consequently show agreement with either the \"possessor\" or the \"possessed\", or both. In French (and most other Romance languages) the third-person singular possessives do not indicate the gender of the possessor, although they agree with the possessed (\"son\", \"sa\" and \"ses\" can all mean either \"his\", \"her\" or \"its\"). This contrasts with English and standard Dutch, where the form of the possessives (\"his\", \"her\", \"its\"; \"zijn\", \"haar\") indicates the grammatical or natural gender of the possessor, but does not depend on properties of the possessed. However German and several Dutch dialects additionally inflect their possessives, thus giving agreement with both possessor and possessed; German has \"sein\" and \"ihr\" meaning \"his\" and \"her\" respectively, but these inflect to give (for example) feminine forms like \"seine\" and \"ihre\", depending on the gender (and number and case) of the thing possessed.\n\nIn languages that have a genitive case, the possessive forms corresponding to pronouns may or may not resemble the genitive of those pronouns. For example, in Russian, the genitive of я \"ja\" \"I\" is меня \"menya\" (\"of me\"), whereas the corresponding possessive is мой \"moy\" (\"my, mine\", in masculine singular nominative form). In German the two sets of forms are quite similar (for example, the genitive of \"ich\" \"I\" is \"meiner\", the corresponding possessive pronoun is also \"meiner\" in the masculine singular nominative, and the possessive determiner is \"mein\" with various endings).\n\nSome languages have no distinct possessive determiners as such, instead using a pronoun together with a possessive particle – a grammatical particle used to indicate possession. For example, in Japanese, \"my\" or \"mine' can be expressed as \"watashi no\", where \"watashi\" means \"I\" and \"no\" is the possessive particle. Similarly in Mandarin Chinese, \"my\" or \"mine\" is \"wǒ de\", where \"wǒ\" means \"I\" and \"de\" is the possessive particle.\n\nAn alternative to the pronominal possessive determiner, found in some languages, including Finnish and Hungarian, is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, attached to the noun denoting the thing possessed. For example, in Finnish the suffix \"-ni\" means \"my\", producing forms such as \"taloni\" (\"my house\"), from \"talo\" (\"house\"). Hungarian possessive suffixes are used in a similar way, as in \"háza\" (\"his/her house\"), formed from \"ház\" (\"house\"). In Hungarian this affix can also be used when the possessor is represented by a full noun, as described in the next section.\n\nPronouns other than personal pronouns, if they have possessive forms, are likely to form them in a similar way to nouns (see below). In English, for example, possessive forms derived from other pronouns include \"one's\", \"somebody's\" and \"nobody's\". There is however a distinct form \"whose\" for the possessive of the interrogative and relative pronoun \"who\"; other languages may have similarly functioning words, such as the Russian чей \"chey\" (\"whose?\"). Another possessive found in Russian and other Slavic languages is the reflexive possessive, corresponding to the general reflexive pronoun; the Russian form is свой \"svoj\" (meaning \"one's (own)\", \"my (own)\", etc.).\n\nIn some languages, possessives are formed from nouns or noun phrases. In English, this is done using the ending \"-'s\", as in \"Jane's\", \"heaven's\", \"the boy's\", \"those men's\", or sometimes just an apostrophe, as in \"workers',\" \"Jesus',\" \"the soldiers'.\" Note that the ending can be added at the end of a noun phrase even when the phrase does not end with its head noun, as in \"the king of England's\"; this property inclines many linguists towards the view that the ending is a clitic rather than a case ending (see below, and further at English possessive).\n\nIn languages that have a genitive case, the genitive form of a noun may sometimes be used as a possessive (as in German \"Karls Haus\" \"Karl's house\"). Languages such as Japanese and Chinese form possessive constructions with nouns using possessive particles, in the same way as described for pronouns above. An example from Japanese is \"neko no iro\" (\"the cat's color\"), where \"neko\" means \"cat\", \"no\" is the particle, and \"iro\" means \"color\".\n\nIn other languages, noun possessives must be formed periphrastically, as in French \"la plume de ma tante\" (\"my aunt's pen\", literally \"the pen of my aunt\"). In Hungarian, the construction \"Mária háza\" is used (\"Maria's house\", literally \"Maria her house\", where the final \"-a\" in \"háza\" is the possessive suffix meaning \"her\"). The possessor noun can carry an additional dative marker, in which case an article appears before the noun. For example, \"Peter's house\" may be translated either as \"Péter háza\" (literally \"Peter his-house\"), or \"Péternek a háza\" (\"of-Peter the his-house\").\n\nPossessive determiners (adjectives) are used in combination with a noun, playing the role of a determiner or attributive adjective. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the definite article. For example, \"my car\" implies \"the car that belongs to me/is used by me\"; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*\"the my car\") or other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*\"this my car\"), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that \"the\" can (\"all my cars\", \"my three cars\", etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in \"la mia macchina\" (\"my car\", literally \"the my car\") or \"quel tuo libro\" (\"that book of yours\", literally \"that your book\").\n\nSome languages place the possessive after the noun, as in Norwegian \"boka mi\" (\"my book\"). Here again the equivalent of the definite article – in this case the definite ending \"-a\" on the noun \"bok\" – is used in addition to the possessive. However, the forms \"min bok\" or \"mi bok\", where the noun \"bok\" is in the indefinite form, are equally correct.\n\nPossessive determiners may be modified with an adverb, as adjectives are, although not as freely or as commonly as is the case with adjectives. Such modification is generally limited to such adverbs as \"more\", \"less\", or \"as much ... as\" (comparative) or \"mostly\" (superlative), for example in \"This is more my team than your team\" and \"This is mostly my team\".\n\nSubstantival possessive pronouns are used on their own and cannot be used to describe a noun, playing the role of noun phrases, so \"mine\" may stand for \"my cat\", \"my sister\", \"my things\", etc. In some languages these may require articles or other determiners, as the French \"le mien\" etc. In English, the \"-'s\" possessives formed from nouns or noun phrases can be used in the same way; \"the president's\" may stand for \"the president's office\", \"the president's policies\", etc., as determined by the context.\n\nA related use is that of the predicative expression, as in sentences like \"the book is mine\". Here \"mine\" may be considered to be a predicate adjective (like \"red\" in \"the book is red\") rather than a pronoun; in English, however, the same possessive form is used anyway. Other languages may use differing forms; for example French may use \"...est à moi\" for \"...is mine\".\n\nA particular use of possessive pronouns (and equivalent noun forms) in English is that illustrated in phrases like \"a friend of mine\" and \"that coat of Fred's\", used to form possessive expressions when the desired determiner is something other than the default \"the\" implied in the usual possessive determiner.\n\nThe terminology used for possessive words and phrases is not consistent among all grammarians and linguists.\n\nWhat some authors refer to as \"possessives\", others may call \"genitives\", and vice versa. Nowadays, however, the term \"genitive\" is most commonly used in relation to languages with a developed case system (in which the \"genitive case\" often has a wider range of functions than merely forming possessives), while in languages like English, where their status as a grammatical case is doubtful, such words are usually called possessives rather than genitives. A given language may have distinct genitive and possessive forms, as in the example of Russian given above. (The English possessive in \"-'s\" is sometimes called the \"Saxon genitive\"; this alludes to its derivation from the genitive case that existed in Old English. It may also be called the \"prenominal genitive\"; this also applies to analogous forms in languages such as German.)\n\nWords like the English \"my\" and \"your\" have traditionally been called \"possessive adjectives\". However, some modern linguists note that in a language such as English they behave like determiners rather than true adjectives (see examples in the section above), and thus prefer to call them \"possessive determiners\". In some other languages, however, the equivalent words behave more like true adjectives (compare the Italian example above, for instance).\n\nWhile for most authors the term \"possessive pronoun\" is reserved (as in this article) for possessives like \"mine\" and \"yours\" which do not qualify an explicit noun, the term is sometimes taken also to include other possessive forms that correspond to pronouns, even though they behave as determiners, qualifying a noun, such as \"my\" and \"your\".\n\nSome authors who classify both sets of words as \"possessive pronouns\" or \"genitive pronouns\" apply the terms dependent/independent or weak/strong to refer, respectively, to \"my\", \"your\", etc. and \"mine\", \"yours\", etc. Thus \"my\" is termed a \"dependent\" (or \"weak\") \"possessive pronoun\", while \"mine\" is an \"independent\" (or \"strong\") \"possessive pronoun\". Also, the first set may be called \"adjectival\" and the second set \"substantival\" possessive pronouns.\n\nAccording to the \"OED\", the first reference to possessive pronouns is found in 1530; the first use of \"possessive\" as a noun occurs in 1591, the first use of \"possessive case\" (which notes that it is like the Latin genitive, and may be called the genitive case in reference to English also) occurs in 1763, and the first use of \"possessive adjective\" dates from 1870.\n\nNouns or pronouns taking the form of a possessive are sometimes described as being in the \"possessive case\". A more commonly \n-used term in describing the grammar of various languages is \"genitive case\", but that usually denotes a case with a broader range of functions than just producing possessive forms. (Some languages occasionally use the dative case to denote the possessor, as in the Serbo-Croatian \"kosa mu je gusta\" \"his hair is thick\" (literally \"the hair to him is thick\" in which \"to him\" is the dative pronoun \"mu\").)\n\nOther theorists reject the idea that the possessive in languages like English as represents a grammatical case since possessive forms do not generally behave in a parallel fashion to what are normally identified as cases. In particular, in English, as noted above, the \"-'s\" can attach to noun phrases even when they do not end with their head noun, as in \"the king of Spain's\", which is not typical behavior for a case ending. For further discussion of the issue, see .\n\nSome languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a \"possessed case\" to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship.\n\nThe relationship expressed by possessive determiners and similar forms is not necessarily one of possession in the strict sense of ownership. In English, strict possession has been found to be expressed in only about 40% of the situations labeled as \"possessive\" by linguists, a fact which may incline some to prefer the more traditional term \"genitive\". The \"possessor\" may be, for example:\n\nFor more examples, see Possession (linguistics) and .\n\n\n"}

Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling.\n\nThe term \"coleslaw\" arose in the 18th century as an anglicisation of the Dutch term \"koolsla\" (\"kool\" in Dutch sounds like \"cole\") meaning \"cabbage salad\". The \"cole\" part of the word comes from the Latin colis, meaning \"cabbage\". \n\nThe 1770 recipe book \"The Sensible Cook: Dutch Foodways in the Old and New World\" contains a recipe attributed to the author's Dutch landlady, who mixed thin strips of cabbage with melted butter, vinegar, and oil. The recipe for coleslaw as it is most commonly prepared is fairly young, as mayonnaise was invented during the mid-18th century.\n\nAccording to \"The Joy of Cooking\" (1997), raw cabbage is the only entirely consistent ingredient in coleslaw; the type of cabbage, dressing, and added ingredients vary widely. Vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and sour cream based dressings are all listed; bacon, carrots, bell peppers, pineapple, pickles, onions, and herbs are specifically mentioned as possible added ingredients.\n\nIn America, what most think of as today's coleslaw originated with the arrival and creation of mayonnaise in the 18th century, but many international coleslaws don't contain mayonnaise — or even cabbage. Coleslaws can be a light crunchy blend of julienne or grated vegetables tossed in vinaigrette, or shredded vegetables with nonfat Greek yogurt combined with spices and herbs.\n\nColeslaw is generally eaten as a side dish with foods such as fried chicken and barbecued meats and may be accompanied by French fries or potato salad as another side dish. It also may be used as a sandwich ingredient, being placed on barbecue sandwiches, hamburgers, and hot dogs along with chili and hot mustard. A vinegar-based coleslaw is the signature ingredient to a Primanti Brothers sandwich. Coleslaw also is used on a variant of the Reuben sandwich, with coleslaw substituting for the sauerkraut; the sandwich is commonly called a Rachel to differentiate it from the Reuben.\n\nColeslaw has an extremely low glycemic index (cabbage 10) and glycemic load (cabbage 0.58) and is rich in fiber.\n\nThere are many variations of the recipe, which include the addition of other ingredients such as red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, mixed with a salad dressing such as mayonnaise or cream. A variety of seasonings, such as celery seed, may be added. The cabbage may come in finely minced pieces, shredded strips, or small squares. Other slaw variants include broccoli slaw, which uses shredded raw broccoli in place of the cabbage. Cream, sour cream, or buttermilk are also popular additions. Buttermilk coleslaw is most commonly found in the southern United States.\n\nTraditional German \"Krautsalat\" consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar. Sometimes onions or apples are added.\n\nColeslaw with cooked ham and sliced pepper (julienne cut) in Italy is called \"insalata capricciosa\" (capricious salad).\n\nVarious cabbage-based salads that resemble coleslaw are commonly served as a side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar, and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to get rid of excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil. \n\nAny simple salad of that kind, i.e. one made with shredded raw vegetables, is known as a \"surówka\" ( 'raw'). If cabbage is the base ingredient, it is simply called a \"surówka z (kiszonej) kapusty\", or a \"(soured) cabbage salad\". The English name \"coleslaw\" is mainly associated with the mayonnaise-dressed cabbage.\n\nIn Russia and Ukraine, a salad of fresh shredded cabbage, mixed with carrots, apples, cranberries etc., is traditionally dressed with unrefined sunflower oil. The cabbage can be marinated before with vinegar producing \"cabbage provençal\" (). A similar salad is also made of sauerkraut.\n\nIn Sweden, a particular type of cabbage salad made with a vinaigrette consisting of vinegar or acetic acid (vinegar essence), vegetable oil, salt, and seasonings is classically served with pizza and known as \"pizzasallad\" (pizza salad). Recipe adds carrots and leeks and is called \"veckosallad\" (week salad) for its notable durability. The term coleslaw is reserved for cabbage salad with carrots and mayonnaise-based dressing, and is typically seen as part of the American cuisine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, coleslaw often contains carrot and onion in addition to cabbage, and is often made with mayonnaise or salad cream. Some variations include grated cheese such as cheddar, or nuts such as walnuts and dried fruits such as sultanas or raisins.\n\nIn the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise or mayonnaise substitutes, and carrot, although many regional variations exist, and recipes incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar without the dairy and mayonnaise are also common. Barbecue slaw, also known as red slaw, is made using ketchup and vinegar rather than mayonnaise. It is frequently served alongside North Carolina barbecue, including Lexington style barbecue, where, unlike in the rest of the state, a red slaw is the prevailing variety.\n\nThis sauce/marinade was born in Morocco and has spread throughout the North African region. The North African Cauliflower Salad is packed with Charmoula Dressing mix of sliced fresh cauliflower florets and shredded carrots. Raisins add a chewy, sweet-tart bite, and arugula is folded in for bright and peppery green. At the heart of charmoula is a blend of spices like coriander and cumin and fresh chilies, mixed with herbs, garlic, fresh lemon juice, and olive oil.\n\nOriginated from Eastern Nigeria, it is popularly called \"Abacha\" it is basically dried shredded cassava mixed with palm oil, Onion, Fresh Utazi leaves \"(Gongronema latifolium)\", Garden Eggs (diced),Garden Egg leaves and other condiments.\n\n"}

It is traditionally a breakfast dish, served with coffee or cafe au lait, and has a mention in most Creole cuisine cookbooks. Calas are also referred to as Creole rice fritters or rice doughnuts.\nThe origin of calas is most often credited to slaves who came from rice-growing regions of Africa. A 1653 French recipe, \"beignets de riz\", lends support to a French origin as well. The name \"calas\" is said to have come from the Nupe word \"kara\" (\"fried cake\"). According to \"The Dictionary of American Food & Drink\", the word calas was first printed in 1880.\nBlack or Creole street vendors, typically women, sold the fresh hot calas in the city's French Quarter, with the cry, \"Bel calas tout chauds!\" (Creole for \"Beautiful calas, still hot\"). These vendors, called \"calas women\", would sell their pastries in the early morning from covered baskets or bowls carried upon their heads.\n\nWriters in the first decade of the 20th century refer to the increasing rarity of calas as street food. Though not widely sold, calas continued to be made at home using leftover rice, and was a typical breakfast food in early 20th-century New Orleans.\n\nAfter World War II, while the beignet remained popular, the calas became more and more obscure. From a breakfast food it evolved into a Mardi Gras and First Communion treat among Catholic African-American families. It could be specially requested at some restaurants. Through the efforts of food preservationists, interest in calas was revived and it began to appear on the menus of some restaurants.\n\nIn early recipes for calas, rice was boiled and cooled, then yeast added to make a sponge that was allowed to proof overnight. From this a batter was made by adding eggs, sugar and a little flour for binding. Rice flour was preferable but difficult to obtain, according to Eustis. A dash of salt might be included, and a grating of nutmeg was a typical addition. The batter was dropped by spoonfuls into deep, boiling lard and fried until browned. Modern recipes reflect the changes in available ingredients, cooking practices, and taste. Baking powder is sometimes used in place of yeast; vegetable oil is substituted for lard; savory variations have been developed.\n\n"}

It is also a byproduct of \"doenjang\" production. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean \"ganjang\" varieties, soup soy sauce is used mainly in \"guk\" (soup) and \"namul\" (a seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine.\n\nSoup soy sauce is referred to by many different names. In the English-speaking world, it is most commonly known as \"soup soy sauce\", which is a direct translation of \"guk-ganjang\" (). The name \"soup soy sauce\" is used because it is used mainly for soup (\"guk\") in modern Korean cuisine. Also, it is the name used by many popular soy sauce brands such as Sempio, Daesang's Chung Jung One, and CJ Cheil Jedang's Beksul. Other names for the sauce include:\n\nThe earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms. The \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", a Chinese historical text written and published in the 3rd century, mentions that \"Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soy beans\", in the section called \"Dongyi\" (Eastern foreigners), in the \"Book of Wei\". Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No. 3 from 4th century Goguryeo.\n\nIn \"Samguk Sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is mentioned that \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang\" along with \"meju\" and \"jeotgal\" were prepared for the wedding ceremony of King Sinmun in February 683. \"Sikhwaji\", a section from \"Goryeosa\" (History of Goryeo), recorded that \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang\" were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as \"Guhwangchwaryo\" and \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\" contain detailed procedures on how to brew good-quality \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang.\" \"Gyuhap chongseo\" explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang\".\n\nSoup soy sauce is made entirely of fermented soybeans and brine. The brewing process also produces \"doenjang\", a Korean fermented bean paste.\n\n\"Meju\", Korean soybean brick, is made around \"ipdong\" in early November. Soybeans are soaked overnight, boiled in salt water, and then pounded in a mortar (\"jeolgu\") or coarsely ground with a millstone. About a \"doe\" (≈1.8 litres) or two of pounded soybeans are chunked, compressed, and shaped into a cube or a sphere called \"meju\". The meju bricks are then dried in a cool, shaded area for a week to several weeks until firm. When the bricks harden, they are tied with rice straws to the eaves of the house, or put in a warm ondol room with rice straw, to ferment. In Jeongwol, the first month of the lunar year, well-fermented \"meju\" bricks are washed and sun-dried.\n\nAfter drying, the \"meju\" bricks are aged in \"onggi\" crocks (\"jangdok\") with brine. Charcoal and chillies are added for their adsorbent and antibacterial properties, as well as folk-religious beliefs that they drive away evil spirits. As the fermentation progresses, the brine acquires flavour and colour. This aged brine is boiled to become soy sauce, and the rest (aged \"meju\" chunks) is mashed to become soybean paste.\n\nThe Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's \"Food Code\" classifies \"hansik ganjang\" into two categories by their ingredients:\n\nDepending on the length of aging, \"hansik ganjang\" can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark.\n\n"}

As in all traditional folk dishes, the exact recipe is not consistent from time to time, or place to place. Common ingredients include lamb, or mutton (mutton is used as it comes from less tender sheep over a year old, is fattier, and has a stronger flavour, and was generally more common in less-affluent times), as well as potatoes, onions, and parsley. It may sometimes also include carrots. Irish stew is also made with kid goat.\n\nStewing is an ancient method of cooking meats that is common throughout the world. However, the Celts did not possess their first bronze cauldrons, copied from Greek models, until the 7th century AD. After the idea of the cauldron was imported from Europe and/or Britain, the cauldron (along with the already established spit) became the dominant cooking tool in ancient Ireland, ovens being practically unknown to the ancient Gaels. The cauldron, along with flesh-hooks for suspending the meat, eventually became preferred over the spit for feasting purposes, as evidenced by archaeological findings that indicate a predominance of flesh hooks over roasting spits in Ireland and Britain (Cunliffe, Barry; \"Britain Begins\"; 2012). Many food historians believe that goat was originally the meat of choice, eventually being supplanted by beef and mutton.\n\nThe root vegetables and meat (originally goat) for the stew were then all in place, save for the potato. The introduction of the potato, originally a South American crop, did not occur until after the 16th century.\n\nAccording to Canadian regulations, commercially produced Irish stew must contain at least 20% mutton, lamb, or beef, and 30% vegetables.

They are made of glass and sealed with a marble; the codd head is held in place by the pressure of the carbonation in the drink. To open the bottle, a plastic device used to push the marble inward is provided. The marble is pushed inside the neck of the bottle where it rattles around while drinking. Therefore, the drinks are sometimes called \"marble soda\" outside Japan. While the Codd-neck bottle was once commonly used for carbonated drinks, today Ramune, along with Banta, is one of its very few users.\n\nPeople trying Ramune for the first time sometimes find it difficult to drink, as it takes practice to learn to stop the marble from blocking the flow. In one version of the bottle introduced in 2006, little slots were added to the cap where the marble was originally held. This prevented the flow from obstruction if the marble falls back into the cap. Ramune is also available in plastic PET bottles and cans.\n\nRamune is one of the modern symbols of summer in Japan and is widely consumed during warm festival days and nights. Empty bottles are usually collected for recycling at stalls where it is sold.\n\nThe original ramune flavor is lemon-lime.

From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe.\n\nThe dish is named either after one of the members of the influential Stroganov family or possibly from the Russian verb строгать (strogat', to chip/shave off (see stroganina)). The first mention of the dish (goviadina po-strogonovski) is made in E. Molokhovets' cookbook \"The Gift to Young Housewives\" in 1871.\n\nElena Molokhovets's classic Russian cookbook \"A Gift to Young Housewives\" gives the first known recipe for \"Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju\", \"Beef \"à la\" Stroganov, with mustard\", in its 1871 edition. The recipe involves lightly floured beef \"cubes\" (not strips) sautéed, sauced with prepared mustard and broth, and finished with a small amount of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms and no alcohol. A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for beef Stroganoff in Russia. The version given in the 1938 \"Larousse Gastronomique\" includes beef \"strips\", and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional. \nAfter the fall of Tsarist Russia, the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of China before the start of World War II. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as US servicemen stationed in pre-Communist China, brought several variants of the dish to the United States, which may account for its popularity during the 1950s. It came to Hong Kong in the late fifties, with Russian restaurants and hotels serving the dish with rice, but not sour cream.\n\nBeef stroganoff preparation varies significantly not only based on geography and other factors, such as the cut of meat and seasonings selected. Meat for the dish can be cut in different ways and is sometimes diced, cubed, or cut into strips. Some variations include mushrooms and onions or other vegetables and varied seasonings such as sugar, salt, black pepper, and bottled marinades and rubs.\nIn the version often prepared in the United States today in restaurants and hotels, it consists of strips of beef filet with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice or noodles. In the UK and Australia, a recipe very similar to that commonly found in the United States has become popular, generally served with rice and sometimes with pasta as well as in commercially prepared frozen dishes. Today, the dish is generally served over wide or twisted egg noodles in the United States. British pubs usually serve a version of the dish with a creamy white wine sauce, whereas more \"authentic\" versions are often red stews with a scoop of sour cream separately served on top.\n\"Larousse Gastronomique\" lists Stroganov as a cream, paprika, veal stock and white wine recipe.\n\nThe Brazilian variant includes diced beef or strips of beef (usually \"filet mignon\") with tomato sauce, onions, mushrooms and heavy cream. Brazilians also prepare Stroganoff with chicken or even shrimp instead of beef. It is commonly served with shoe-string potatoes, as in Russia, but with the addition of white rice. Sometimes one can also see creative servings of \"estrogonofe\", such as a crepe filling, a topping for baked potatoes, or on pizzas. Many recipes and variations exist — with or without wine, with canned sweet corn, with ketchup instead of tomato sauce, etc.\n\nStroganoff is also popular in Nordic countries. In Sweden, a common variant is \"korv-stroganoff\" (sausage Stroganoff), which uses the local \"falukorv\" sausage as a substitute for the beef. In Finland, the dish is called \"makkara-stroganoff\", makkara meaning any kind of sausage. Beef Stroganoff is, however, also a common dish. Diced brined pickles are also a normal ingredient in Finnish Stroganoff.\n\nStroganoff's popularity extends to Japan, where it is most commonly served with white rice, or white rice seasoned with parsley and butter. Its popularity increased dramatically with the introduction of \"instant sauce cubes\" from S&B corporation. These are cubes with dried seasoning and thickening agents that can be added to water, onion, beef, and mushrooms to make a Stroganoff-style sauce. Additionally, Japanese home recipes for Stroganoff frequently call for \"non-traditional\" Japanese ingredients, such as small amounts of soy sauce.\n\n\n"}

Cheese fries are generally served as a lunch- or dinner-time meal. They can be found in fast-food locations, diners, and grills all across the United States, as well as the rest of the world.\n\nThe dish originated in the United States, although its exact birthplace is still widely disputed. Cheese fries have been said to grow in popularity in the United States after canned cheese products such as Cheez Whiz hit the U.S. markets in 1952. Don A. Jenkins is said to have invented a variation of the cheese fry (the chili cheese fry), at the age of 16, in Tomball, Texas. Another report claims that a young fry cook named Austin Ruse was the first to serve this dish while working at Dairy Queen in St. Charles, MO.\n\nThroughout the Southwest US, cheese fries are often covered in melted cheddar cheese, bacon bits, jalapeño slices, and chives, and served with ranch dressing. Alternately, they are also served as carne asada fries.\nIn Philadelphia, pizza fries are topped with melted mozzarella and served with pizza sauce on the side, while \"mega fries\" are topped with cheddar (or sometimes Cheez Whiz) and mozzarella cheese and bacon. Usually served with a side of ranch dressing. \nIn New York City, Long Island, and New Jersey, they are covered with American, mozzarella, or Swiss cheese, then melted.\nIn New Jersey and certain New York City diners, Disco Fries are served with mozzarella and brown gravy.\nIn other parts of the US, nacho cheese is often used, especially in snack stand-type settings.\n\nChili cheese fries are topped with chili con carne. The cheese is usually either American or cheddar. In Cincinnati, Ohio, they use their own Cincinnati chili for their chili cheese fries at the local chili restaurants. In New Mexico, they use New Mexican chile for their chili cheese fries, often adding chopped lettuce, tomato, and olives as garnish.\n\nIn Ireland, a variation called \"taco fries\" consists of fresh cut chips covered in sub sauce and shredded cheddar. Piled on top of the cheese are ground beef, tomato, peppers, onions, and various seasonings.\nIn Bulgaria, a common side dish offered in most restaurants consists of French fries, topped with grated or crumbled \"sirene\".\nIn the Netherlands a dish named 'kapsalon' is served as fast food. This consist of fries covered with cheese, salad, and shawarma or doner kebab.

{"id": "923714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923714", "title": "Antiaromaticity", "text": "Antiaromaticity\n\nAntiaromaticity is a characteristic of a cyclic molecule with a π electron system that has higher energy due to the presence of 4n electrons in it. Unlike aromatic compounds, which follow Hückel's rule ([4\"n\"+2] π electrons) and are highly stable, antiaromatic compounds are highly unstable and highly reactive. To avoid the instability of antiaromaticity, molecules may change shape, becoming non-planar and therefore breaking some of the π interactions. In contrast to the diamagnetic ring current present in aromatic compounds, antiaromatic compounds have a paramagnetic ring current, which can be observed by NMR spectroscopy.\n\nExamples of antiaromatic compounds are pentalene (A), biphenylene (B), cyclopentadienyl cation (C). The prototypical example of antiaromaticity, cyclobutadiene, is the subject of debate, with some scientists arguing that antiaromaticity is not a major factor contributing to its destabilization.\nCyclooctatetraene is an example of a molecule adopting a non-planar geometry to avoid the destabilization that results from antiaromaticity. If it were planar, it would have a single eight-electron π system around the ring, but it instead adopts a boat-like shape with four individual π bonds. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.\n\nThe term 'antiaromaticity' was first proposed by Ronald Breslow in 1967 as \"a situation in which a cyclic delocalisation of electrons is destabilising\". The IUPAC criteria for antiaromaticity are as follows:\n\n\nThis differs from aromaticity in the fourth criterion: aromatic molecules have 4\"n\" +2 π-electrons in the conjugated π system and therefore follow Hückel’s rule. Non-aromatic molecules are either noncyclic, nonplanar, or do not have a complete conjugated π system within the ring.\n\nHaving a planar ring system is essential for maximizing the overlap between the \"p\" orbitals which make up the conjugated π system. This explains why being a planar, cyclic molecule is a key characteristic of both aromatic and antiaromatic molecules. However, in reality, it is difficult to determine whether or not a molecule is completely conjugated simply by looking at its structure: sometimes molecules can distort in order to relieve strain and this distortion has the potential to disrupt the conjugation. Thus, additional efforts must be taken in order to determine whether or not a certain molecule is genuinely antiaromatic.\n\nAn antiaromatic compound may demonstrate its antiaromaticity both kinetically and thermodynamically. As will be discussed later, antiaromatic compounds experience exceptionally high chemical reactivity (being highly reactive is not “indicative” of an antiaromatic compound, it merely suggests that the compound could be antiaromatic). An antiaromatic compound may also be recognized thermodynamically by measuring the energy of the cyclic conjugated π electron system. In an antiaromatic compound, the amount of conjugation energy in the molecule will be significantly higher than in an appropriate reference compound.\n\nIn reality, it is recommended that one analyze the structure of a potentially antiaromatic compound extensively before declaring that it is indeed antiaromatic. If an experimentally determined structure of the molecule in question does not exist, a computational analysis must be performed. The potential energy of the molecule should be probed for various geometries in order to assess any distortion from a symmetric planar conformation. \nThis procedure is recommended because there have been multiple instances in the past where molecules which appear to be antiaromatic on paper turn out to be not truly so in actuality. The most famous (and heavily debated) of these molecules is cyclobutadiene, as is discussed later.\n\nExamples of antiaromatic compounds are pentalene (A), biphenylene (B), cyclopentadienyl cation (C). The prototypical example of antiaromaticity, cyclobutadiene, is the subject of debate, with some scientists arguing that antiaromaticity is not a major factor contributing to its destabilization. Cyclooctatetraene appears at first glance to be antiaromatic, but is an excellent example of a molecule adopting a non-planar geometry to avoid the destabilization that results from antiaromaticity. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.\n\nThe paramagnetic ring current resulting from the electron delocalization in antiaromatic compounds can be observed by NMR. This ring current leads to a deshielding (downfield shift) of nuclei inside the ring and a shielding (upfield shift) of nuclei outside the ring. [12]annulene is an antiaromatic hydrocarbon that is large enough to have protons both inside and outside of the ring. The chemical shift for the protons inside its ring is 5.91 ppm and that for the protons outside the ring is 7.86 ppm, compared to the normal range of 4.5-6.5 ppm for nonaromatic alkenes. This effect is of a smaller magnitude than the corresponding shifts in aromatic compounds.\n\nMany aromatic and antiaromatic compounds (benzene and cyclobutadiene) are too small to have protons inside of the ring, where shielding and deshielding effects can be more diagnostically useful in determining if a compound is aromatic, antiaromatic, or nonaromatic. Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) analysis is a method of computing the ring shielding (or deshielding) at the center of a ring system to predict aromaticity or antiaromaticity. A negative NICS value is indicative of aromaticity and a positive value is indicative of antiaromaticity.\n\nWhile there are multitudes of molecules in existence which would appear to be antiaromatic on paper, the number of molecules that are antiaromatic in actuality is considerably less. This is compounded by the fact that one cannot typically make derivatives of antiaromatic molecules by adding more antiaromatic hydrocarbon rings, etc. because the molecule typically loses either its planar nature or its conjugated system of π-electrons and becomes nonaromatic. In this section, only examples of antiaromatic compounds which are non-disputable are included.\n\nPentalene is an antiaromatic compound which has been well-studied both experimentally and computationally for decades. It is dicyclic, planar and has eight π-electrons, fulfilling the IUPAC definition of antiaromaticity. Pentalene’s dianionic and dicationic states are aromatic, as they follow Hückel’s 4\"n\" +2 π-electron rule.<ref name=\"10.1002/poc.1907\"></ref>\n\nLike its relative [12]annulene, hexadehydro[12]annulene is also antiaromatic. The structure of hexadehydro[12]annulene has been studied computationally via ab initio and density functional theory calculations and is confirmed to be antiaromatic.\n\nCyclobutadiene is the classic textbook example of an antiaromatic compound. It is conventionally understood to be planar, cyclic, and have 4 π electrons (4\"n\" for \"n\"=1) in a conjugated system.\n\nHowever, it has long been questioned if cyclobutadiene is genuinely antiaromatic and recent discoveries have suggested that it may not be. Cyclobutadiene is particularly destabilized and this was originally attributed to antiaromaticity. However, cyclobutadiene adopts more double bond character in two of its parallel bonds than others and the π electrons are not delocalized between the two double-bond-like bonds, giving it a rectangular shape as opposed to a regular square. As such, cyclobutadiene behaves like two discrete alkenes joined by two single bonds, and is therefore non-aromatic rather than antiaromatic.\n\nDespite the lack of this π-antiaromatic destabilization effect, none of its 4\"n\" π-electron relatives (cyclooctatetraene, etc.) had even close to as much destabilization, suggesting there was something more going on in the case of cyclobutadiene. It was found that a combination of angle strain, torsional strain, and Pauli repulsion leads to the extreme destabilization experienced in this molecule.\n\nThis discovery is awkward in that it contradicts basic teachings of antiaromaticity. At this point of time, it is presumed that cyclobutadiene will continue to be used to introduce the concept of antiaromaticity in textbooks as a matter of convenience, even though classifying it as antiaromatic technically may not be accurate.\n\nThe cyclopentadienyl cation is another textbook example of an antiaromatic compound. It is conventionally understood to be planar, cyclic, and have 4 π electrons (4\"n\" for \"n\"=1) in a conjugated system.\n\nHowever, it has long been questioned if the cyclopentadienyl cation is genuinely antiaromatic and recent discoveries have suggested that it may not be. The lowest-energy singlet state is antiaromatic, but the lowest-energy triplet state is aromatic due to Baird's rule, and research in 2007 showed the triplet state to be the ground state.\n\nAnother example of a molecule which is not antiaromatic even though it might initially appear to be so is cyclooctatetraene. Cyclooctatetraene assumes a tub (i.e., boat-like) conformation. As it is not planar, even though it has 4\"n\" π-electrons, these electrons are not delocalized and conjugated. The molecule is therefore nonaromatic.\n\nAntiaromatic compounds, often being very unstable, can be highly reactive in order to relieve the antiaromatic destabilization. Cyclobutadiene, for example, rapidly dimerizes with no potential energy barrier via a 2 + 2 cycloaddition reaction to form tricyclooctadiene. While the antiaromatic character of cyclobutadiene is the subject of debate, the relief of antiaromaticity is usually invoked as the driving force of this reaction.\n\nAntiaromaticity can also have a significant effect on pK. The linear compound 1-propene has a pK of 44, which is relatively acidic for an sp carbon center because the resultant allyl anion can be resonance stabilized. The analogous cyclic system appears to have even more resonance stabilized, as the negative charge can be delocalized across three carbons instead of two. However, the cyclopropenyl anion has 4 π electrons in a cyclic system and in fact has a substantially \"higher\" pK than 1-propene because it is antiaromatic and thus destabilized. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.\n\nSome antiaromatic compounds are stable, especially larger cyclic systems (in which the antiaromatic destabilization is not as substantial). For example, the aromatic species 1 can be reduced to 2 with a relatively small penalty for forming an antiaromatic system. The antiaromatic 2 does revert to the aromatic species 1 over time by reacting with oxygen in the air because the aromaticity is preferred.\n\nThe loss of antiaromaticity can sometimes be the driving force of a reaction. In the following keto-enol tautomerization, the product enol is more stable than the original ketone even though the ketone contains an aromatic benzene moiety (blue). However, there is also an antiaromatic lactone moiety (green). The relief of antiaromatic destabilization provides a driving force that outweighs even the loss of an aromatic benzene.\n"}

The \"main line\" or \"first line\" is the main section of the parade, or the members of the actual club with the parading permit as well as the brass band. Those who follow the band just to enjoy the music are called the \"second line\". The second line's style of traditional dance, in which participants walk and sometimes twirl a parasol or handkerchief in the air, is called \"second lining\". It has been called \"the quintessential New Orleans art form – a jazz funeral without a body\". Another significant difference from jazz funerals is that second line parades usually lack the slow hymns and dirges played at funerals (although this is not a hard rule; some organizations may have the band play something solemn towards the start of the parade in memory of members who died since their last parade).\n\nSome scholars believe that second lining has its origins in traditional West African circle dances, where children formed a periphery circle outside the main circle of adult dancers. The dance was brought by slaves to New Orleans, where it became incorporated into processions, such as funerals, forcing the ring to straighten into a line. Others note the similarity of the steps – exaggerated, loosely coordinated strutting – to dances performed in Congo Square by the enslaved given the day off on Sundays. These dances were officially banned for a time because they were deemed threatening to the white inhabitants of the city, and their resurgence in second lining suggests a similar celebration of individual freedom.\n\nAfter the Civil War, African and African-American traditions came to be merged with the military brass band parade traditions of the Europeans and white Americans. Insurance companies often refused to cover the recently freed formerly enslaved, so African Americans formed Benevolent Societies and \"Social Aid & Pleasure Clubs\". Membership benefits usually included a brass band for funerals and at least one public parade with music a year, so such societies became important in establishing the second line traditions.\n\n\"The Second Line\" – the magazine of the New Orleans jazz club, started in 1950 – took its name from the second lining tradition, which by that time included fans of jazz music, both black and white.\n\nA second line snare drummer commonly follows the brass band, playing off of the marching beat with improvised polyrhythmic figures that can inspire second line dancers or, if the band is improvising, the band itself. Second line drumming styles became a feature of early jazz drumming and the New Orleans Rhythm and Blues of the 1950s. The Rebirth Brass Band and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band feature traditional second line drumming styles. Idris Muhammad adapted second line drum figures to modern jazz.\n\nSecond line parades are part of the cultural heritage of New Orleans.\n\nThe locally best known second line parades are held by clubs and benevolent organizations. Some have long histories; the oldest such organization still holding regular parades is the Young Men Olympian Junior Benevolent Association, founded in 1884. During the \"second line season\", lasting most of the year with breaks for holidays (including Mardi Gras) and the hottest part of summer, there are second line parades most Sundays. Longer parades often make stops, commonly at bars, where refreshments have been arranged for members and those following the parade for fun can purchase something. There are often vendors selling soft drinks, beer, and street food, including barbecue and yaka mein.\n\nAdditional second lines, large or small, may be held for any event which people think merits hiring a parading band for such a style of celebration, including weddings and opening of businesses.\n\nThe historic predominantly African-American neighborhoods of Tremé and Central City are most strongly associated with the traditions, though second lines can often be seen in the Seventh Ward, Uptown, Marigny, Ninth Ward, Mid-City, and at least on occasion in most of the older neighborhoods of the city. The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival holds second lines at the Fair Grounds each day of the festival to give visitors a taste of this New Orleans tradition.\n\nHistorically, the parades were unofficial events and sometimes had an air of menace. A second line parade was featured in the 1973 James Bond film \"Live and Let Die\". In 2010, the opening scene in the pilot episode, as well as the season one finale of the HBO series \"Tremé\" featured a second line parade and journalists championed second line culture. After Hurricane Katrina, new residents of New Orleans embraced the second line tradition and it became part of the cultural economy of the city. Parade routes were publicized online inviting outsiders to participate.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of second line events have been peaceful, but like any other public event where large numbers of people gather, violence has marred some parades in recent years, most notoriously in the gang-related May 12, 2013 Mother's Day Parade shooting where 19 were wounded and one trampled, and again on November 22, 2015, at Bunny Friend Park, where 17 were wounded, three critically.\n\nThough originally a New Orleans phenomenon, in recent times the style has spread to other parts of the country; the HONK! Festival in Somerville, Massachusetts was started by the Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band. Asheville, North Carolina has the Asheville Second Line Band, which marches at parades and other local events. Still, second lining remains most common in the New Orleans area.\n\n"}
{"id": "926011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=926011", "title": "Rasayana", "text": "Rasayana\n\nRasāyana, रसायन is a Sanskrit word, with the literal meaning: \"Path\" (\"āyana\") \"of essence\" (\"rasa\"). It is a term that in early ayurvedic medicine means the science of lengthening lifespan, and in later (post 8th-century) works sometimes refers to Indian alchemy.\n\nThe name of the science of Indian alchemy or proto-chemistry, is more generally \"The Science of Mercury\", or \"Rasaśāstra, रसशास्त्र \" in Sanskrit, Nepali, Marathi, Hindi, Kannada and several other languages.\nEarly Indian alchemical texts discuss the use of prepared forms of mercury or cinnabar (see samskaras).\nHowever, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy.\n\nSignificant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India. An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī reported that \"They have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them. They call it \"Rasâyana\", a word composed with \"rasa\", i.e., gold. It means an art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, and compound medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restore the health of those who were ill beyond hope, and give back youth to fading old age...\" Raseśvara, a school of Indian philosophy was focused on finding Moksha: perfection, immortality, liberation using mercury. As such it focuses its efforts on transumation of the human body: from mortal to immortal. Many are the traditional stories of alchemists still alive since time immemorial due to the effects of their experiments. The texts of Ayurvedic Medicine and Science have aspects similar to alchemy: concepts of cures for all known diseases, and treatments that focus on anointing the body with oils.\n\nSince alchemy eventually became engrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as Samkhya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Ayurveda were inevitable. Nonetheless, most of the Rasayāna texts track their origins back to Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranatha and the lineage of the Natha Siddhas.\n\nTwo famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a Buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagara. His famous book, \"Rasaratanakaram\", is a famous example of early Indian medicine. In traditional Indian medicinal terminology \"rusa\" translates as \"mercury\" and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold.\n\nRasayana therapy enriches rasa with nutrients to help one attain longevity, memory, intelligence, health, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion and voice, optimum development of physique and sense organs, mastery over phonetics, respectability and brilliance.\n\n\nIn pursuit of these matters, herbal prescriptions with many herbal substances, preserved in ghee and honey are given. Chyawanprasha is one of the traditional rasayanas. Specific adaptogenic herbs are also included in rasayanas including haritaki, amla, shilajit, ashwaganda, holy basil, guduchi and shatavari.\n\nSeveral rasayana herbs have been tested for adaptogenic properties:\nThe whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withmania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.\n\nPuri has given detailed account of Classical formulations such as Amrit Rasayana, Brahm Rasayana, Jawahar Mohra, Kamdugdha Ras, Laxami Vilas Ras, Laxman Vilas Ras, Madanoday Modak, Makrdhawaj vati, Manmath Ras, Mukta Panchamrit Rasayana, Nari Kalyan Pak, Navjeevan Ras, Navratna Ras, Navratnakalp Amrit, Panchamrit Ras, Paradi Ras, Ramchuramni Ras, Rattivalbh Pak, Shukar Amrit Vati, Smritisagar Ras, Suvarn Malini Vasant, Suvarn Vasant Malti, Swapanmehtank, Vasant Kusmakar Ras, Visha Rasaayana, Vrihda Vangeshwar Rasa.\n\nThese classical Rasayan formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed (samskara) mercury (the word \"ras\" indicates mercury as an ingredient). Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products. The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber, and parts of wild-life animals nearly impossible.\n\nThe current Rasayan formulas are based on such ingredients as amla (Emblica officinalis) which, if fresh, has high content of vitamin C, Terminalia belerica, Terminalia chebula, Shilajit, Long pepper, Black pepper, Ginger, processed Guggul, Guduchi, Ashwaganda, Shatavari and similar ingredients.\n\nRasayan Shastr in Ancient India was much less developed than today. Nevertheless, the use and practice of Rasayan was widespread in Ancient India, and some examples of applied rasayan include paints used in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Maharashtra state, the steel of \"Vishnustambha\" (literal meaning: the tower of Vishnu), and a processed wood sample in the Kondivade caves near the Rajmachi fort in Maharashtra.\n\nIn many Indian homes, rasayana (fruit squash) juices are prepared and served as drink, desert or as accompaniment to meals. In Tulunadu region of India, Banana and Mango Rasayana are made by mixing fruit pulp with cow's milk or coconut milk to a thick consistency. This rasayana may be drunk as juice by diluting with water or milk. With thick consistency it is used as accompaniment to Dosa, Chapati or meals. Rasayana may also be known as \"lassi\". Many believe this rasayana helps to beat the heat of Indian summers.\n\n"}
{"id": "927830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=927830", "title": "Go motion", "text": "Go motion\n\nGo motion is a variation of stop motion animation which incorporates motion blur into each frame involving motion. It was co-developed by Industrial Light & Magic and Phil Tippett. Stop motion animation can create a disorienting, and distinctive staccato effect, because the animated object is perfectly sharp in every frame, since each frame of the animation was actually shot when the object was perfectly still. Real moving objects in similar scenes of the same movie will have motion blur, because they moved while the shutter of the camera was open. Filmmakers use a variety of techniques to simulate motion blur, such as moving the model slightly during the exposure of each film frame or using a glass plate smeared with petroleum jelly in front of the camera lens to blur the moving areas.\n\nLadislas Starevich started using this technique by the time he started making films in France (1920s). He moved the puppet or the set during the exposure of the frame to create motion blur. Some of this can be seen in films like \"The Midnight Wedding\", \"Love in Black and White\", \"The Voice of the Nightingale\" or \"The Little Parade\" and more extensively in the battle scene of \"The Queen of the Butterflies\" (1924) and \"The Mascot\" (1933). Phil Tippett and Industrial Light & Magic later recreated the go motion technique for some shots of the tauntaun creatures and AT-AT walkers in the 1980 \"Star Wars\" film \"The Empire Strikes Back\". After that, go motion was used for many other movies: for the dragon in \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), the dinosaurs in the prehistoric documentaries \"Prehistoric Beast\" (1984) and \"Dinosaur!\" (1985), the harpy sequence in \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" (1985), the lord demon creature in \"Howard the Duck\" (1986), the winged demon in \"The Golden Child\" (1986), the extraterrestrial living flying machines in \"Batteries Not Included\" (1987), the two-headed Eborsisk dragon in \"Willow\" (1988), the \"RoboCop\" franchise (1987–1993) and \"Coneheads\" (1993). Other minor sequences using go motion appeared in films like the first three \"Indiana Jones\" installments (1981–1989) and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) among a few others. In 1993, with the release of \"Jurassic Park\", Tippett Studio abandoned go motion and fully converted its teams and equipment to CG. The last film using go motion was \"Coneheads\" (\"Jurassic Park\" was released on June 11, 1993 but \"Coneheads\" was released on July 23, 1993).\n\nThis crude but reasonably effective technique involves smearing petroleum jelly (\"Vaseline\") on a plate of glass in front of the camera lens, also known as vaselensing, then cleaning and reapplying it after each shot — a time-consuming process, but one which creates a blur around the model. This technique was used for the endoskeleton in \"The Terminator\". This process was also employed by Jim Danforth to blur the pterodactyl's wings in Hammer Films' \"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\", and by Randal William Cook on the terror dogs sequence in \"Ghostbusters\".\n\nGently bumping or flicking the puppet before taking the frame will produce a slight blur; however, care must be taken when doing this that the puppet does not move too much or that one does not bump or move props or set pieces.\n\nMoving the table on which the model is standing while the film is being exposed creates a slight, realistic blur. This technique was developed by Ladislas Starevich: when the characters ran, he moved the set in the opposite direction. This is seen in \"The Little Parade\" when the ballerina is chased by the devil. Starevich also used this technique on his films \"The Eyes of the Dragon\", \"The Magical Clock\" and \"The Mascot\". Aardman Animations used this for the train chase in \"The Wrong Trousers\" and again during the lorry chase in \"A Close Shave\". In both cases the cameras were moved physically during a 1-2 second exposure. The technique was revived for the full-length \"\".\n\nThe most sophisticated technique was originally developed for the film \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and used for some shots of the tauntauns and was later used on films like \"Dragonslayer\" and is quite different from traditional stop motion. The model is essentially a rod puppet. The rods are attached to motors which are linked to a computer that can record the movements as the model is traditionally animated. When enough movements have been made, the model is reset to its original position, the camera rolls and the model is moved across the table. Because the model is moving during shots, motion blur is created.\n\nA variation of go motion was used in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" to partially animate the children on their bicycles.\n\nGo motion was originally planned to be used extensively for the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\", until Steven Spielberg decided to try out the swiftly developing techniques of CG instead.\n\nToday, the mechanical method of achieving motion blur using go motion is rarely used, as it is more complicated, slow, and labor-intensive than computer generated effects. However, the motion blurring technique still has potential in real stop motion movies where the puppet's motions are supposed to be somewhat realistic. Many professional visual effects applications now allow for motion blur to be simulated in post production.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is onomatopoeic, derived from the sound emitted when the ingredients are stirred in the cooking pot. The food is cooked piece by piece by the diner at the table. Shabu-shabu is considered to be more savory and less sweet than \"sukiyaki\".\n\n\"Shabu-Shabu\" was introduced in Japan in the 20th century with the opening of the restaurant \"Suehiro\" in Osaka, where the name was invented. Its origins are traced back to the Chinese hot pot known as instant-boiled mutton (\"Shuàn Yángròu\"). \"Shabu-Shabu\" is most similar to the original Chinese version when compared to other Japanese hot-pot dishes (\"nabemono\") such as \"sukiyaki\". Suehiro registered the name as a trademark in 1955. Together with \"sukiyaki\", \"Shabu-Shabu\" is a common dish in many parts of Japan, but also in local Japanese neighborhoods (colloquially called \"Little Tokyos\") in countries such as the United States and Canada.\n\nThe dish is usually made with thinly sliced beef, but some versions use pork, crab, chicken, lamb, duck, or lobster. Most often, ribeye steak is used, but less tender cuts, such as top sirloin, are also common. A more expensive meat, such as \"wagyu\", may also be used. It is usually served with tofu and vegetables, including Chinese cabbage, chrysanthemum leaves, \"nori\" (edible seaweed), onions, carrots, shiitake mushrooms and enokitake mushrooms. In some places, \"udon\", \"mochi\" or \"harusame\" noodles may also be served.\n\nThe dish is prepared by submerging a thin slice of meat or a piece of vegetable in a pot of boiling water or \"dashi\" (broth) made with \"konbu\" (kelp) and stirring it. Cooked meat and vegetables are usually dipped in \"ponzu\" or \"goma\" (sesame seed) sauce before eating, and served with a bowl of steamed white rice. Once the meat and vegetables have been eaten, leftover broth from the pot is customarily combined with the remaining rice, and the resulting soup is usually eaten last.\n\nA number of sauces can be used to dip meats and vegetables when eating shabu-shabu. Normally, the raw meat is dipped into the hot stock for just a few seconds, as the pieces are sliced paper thin. Putting all meat into the pot in one go may result in overcooking the meat. There are a variety of sauces that can be used to dip the meat and vegetables, including ponzu sauce and sesame sauce. Restaurants usually provide soy sauce, sesame paste, ponzu sauce and several other condiment options such as spring onions and Japanese pickled carrots so that customers can make the sauce according to their own preferences.\n\n"}

{"id": "930910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=930910", "title": "Paneer", "text": "Paneer\n\nPaneer () is a fresh cheese common in the Indian subcontinent. It is an unaged, non-melting farmer cheese made by curdling milk with a vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. Its acid-set form (cheese curd or acid-set cottage cheese) is called chhena.\n\nThe word \"paneer\" is of Persian origin. The Turkish word \"peynir\", the Persian word \"panir\", the Azerbaijani word \"pendir\", and the Armenian word \"panir\" (պանիր), all derived from \"paneer\", refer to any type of cheese. The origin of paneer itself is debated. Vedic Indian, Afghan-Iranian and Portuguese-Bengali origins have been proposed for paneer.\n\nVedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as Sanjeev Kapoor, as a form of paneer. According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18. However, Otto Schrader believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\". K. T. Achaya mentions that acidulation of milk was a taboo in the ancient Indo-Aryan culture, pointing out that the legends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese.\n\nBased on texts such as \"Charaka Samhita\", BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75-300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era. Sunil Kumar \"et al\". interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to north-western part of South Asia, and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travelers. For the making of what is today called chhana, the Manasollasa recommends the addition of a sour substance (even sour curds from a previous operation) to boiled milk, after which the precipitate was separated, the cheese then mixed with rice flour and shaped into various balls, and then deep fried to make sweets. National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders.\n\nThe Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence.\n\nPaneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt), to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2–3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.\n\nIn most Nepalese cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese.\n\nIn Bengali and other east Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called \"ponir\"), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking.\n\nIn the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, \"Surti Paneer\" is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours.\n\nPaneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. The use of paneer is more common in the Indian subcontinent and Indian dishes globally. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer).\n\nThe well-known rasgulla features plain \"chhana\" beaten by hand and shaped into balls which are boiled in syrup. The \"sana\" / \"chhana\" / \"chhena\" used in such cases is manufactured by a slightly different procedure from paneer; it is drained but not pressed, so that some moisture is retained, which makes for a soft, malleable consistency. It may, however, be pressed slightly into small cubes and curried to form a \"dalna\" in Maithili, Oriya and Bengali cuisines.\n\nSome paneer recipes include:\n\nMost international fast food restaurants in India offer paneer-based food. McDonald's India serves the McSpicy Paneer and Paneer Wrap. In the United Kingdom, Subway serves a saag paneer patty. Taco Bell India serves a paneer and potato burrito. Pizza Hut, Domino's, and Papa John's have pizzas with paneer toppings.\n\nAnari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed cottage cheese) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many Indians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese may be made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants and such varieties when pressed into farmer cheese are firmer than paneer. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer.\n"}

In the 19th century, Ivan Yarkovsky realized that the thermal radiation escaping from a body warmed by the Sun carries off momentum as well as heat. Translated into modern physics, each emitted photon possesses a momentum \"p\" = \"E/c\" where \"E\" is its energy and \"c\" is the speed of light. Vladimir Radzievskii applied the idea to rotation based on changes in albedo and Stephen Paddack realized that shape was a much more effective means of altering a body's spin rate. Stephen Paddack and John O'Keefe suggested that the YORP effect leads to rotational bursting and by repeatedly undergoing this process, small asymmetric bodies are eventually reduced to dust.\n\nIn principle, electromagnetic radiation interacts with the surface of an asteroid in three significant ways: radiation from the Sun is (1) absorbed and (2) diffusively reflected by the surface of the body and the body's internal energy is (3) emitted as thermal radiation. Since photons possess momentum, each of these interactions leads to changes in the angular momentum of the body relative to its center of mass. If considered for only a short period of time, these changes are very small, but over longer periods of time, these changes may integrate to significant changes in the angular momentum of the body. For bodies in a heliocentric orbit, the relevant long periods of time is the orbital period (i.e. year), since most asteroids have rotation periods (i.e. days) shorter than their orbital periods. Thus, for most asteroids, the YORP effect is the secular change in the rotation state of the asteroid after averaging the solar radiation torques over first the rotational period and then the orbital period.\n\nIn 2007 there was direct observational confirmation of the YORP effect on the small asteroids 54509 YORP (then designated ) and 1862 Apollo. The spin rate of 54509 YORP will double in just 600,000 years, and the YORP effect can also alter the axial tilt and precession rate, so that the entire suite of YORP phenomena can send asteroids into interesting resonant spin states, and helps explain the existence of binary asteroids.\n\nObservations show that asteroids larger than 125 km in diameter have rotation rates that follow a Maxwellian frequency distribution, while smaller asteroids (in the 50 to 125 km size range) show a small excess of fast rotators. The smallest asteroids (size less than 50 km) show a clear excess of very fast and slow rotators, and this becomes even more pronounced as smaller populations are measured. These results suggest that one or more size-dependent mechanisms are depopulating the centre of the spin rate distribution in favour of the extremes. The YORP effect is a prime candidate. It is not capable of significantly modifying the spin rates of large asteroids by itself, so a different explanation must be sought for objects such as 253 Mathilde.\n\nIn late 2013 asteroid P/2013 R3 was observed breaking apart, likely because of a high rotation speed from the YORP effect.\n\nAssume a rotating spherical asteroid has two wedge-shaped fins attached to its equator, irradiated by parallel rays of sunlight. The reaction force from photons departing from any given surface element of the spherical core will be normal to the surface, such that no torque is produced (the force vectors all pass through the centre of mass).\n\nThermally-emitted photons reradiated from the sides of the wedges, however, can produce a torque, as the normal vectors do not pass through the centre of mass. Both fins present the same cross section to the incoming light (they have the same height and width), and so absorb and reflect the same amount of energy each and produce an equal force. Due to the fin surfaces being oblique, however, the normal forces from the reradiated photons do not cancel out. In the diagram, Fin A's outgoing radiation produces an equatorial force parallel to the incoming light and no vertical force, but Fin B's force has a smaller equatorial component and a vertical component. The unbalanced forces on the two fins lead to torque and the object spins. The torque from the outgoing light does not average out, even over a full rotation, so the spin accelerates over time.\n\nAn object with some \"windmill\" asymmetry can therefore be subjected to minuscule torque forces that will tend to spin it up or down as well as make its axis of rotation precess. The YORP effect is zero for a rotating ellipsoid \"if\" there are no irregularities in surface temperature or albedo.\n\nIn the long term, the object's changing obliquity and rotation rate may wander randomly, chaotically or regularly, depending on several factors. For example, assuming the Sun remains on its equator, asteroid 951 Gaspra, with a radius of 6 km and a semi-major axis of 2.21 AU, would in 240 Ma (240 million years) go from a rotation period of 12 h to 6 h and vice versa. If 243 Ida were given the same radius and orbit values as Gaspra, it would spin up or down twice as fast, while a body with Phobos' shape would take several billion years to change its spin by the same amount.\n\nSize as well as shape affects the amount of the effect. Smaller objects will spin up or down much more quickly. If Gaspra were smaller by a factor of 10 (to a radius of 500 m), its spin will halve or double in just a few million years. Similarly, the YORP effect intensifies for objects closer to the Sun. At 1 AU, Gaspra would double/halve its spin rate in a mere 100,000 years. After one million years, its period may shrink to ~2 h, at which point it could start to break apart.\n\nThis is one mechanism through which binary asteroids may form, and it may be more common than collisions and planetary near-encounter tidal disruption as the primary means of binary formation.\n\nAsteroid was later named 54509 YORP to honor its part in the confirmation of this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "931106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=931106", "title": "CTIA and GTIA", "text": "CTIA and GTIA\n\nColor Television Interface Adaptor (CTIA) and its successor Graphic Television Interface Adaptor (GTIA) are custom chips used in the Atari 8-bit family of computers and in the Atari 5200 console. In these systems, a CTIA or GTIA chip works together with ANTIC to produce the video display. ANTIC generates the playfield graphics (text and bitmap) while CTIA/GTIA provides the color for the playfield and adds overlay objects known as player/missile graphics (sprites). Under the direction of Jay Miner, the CTIA/GTIA chips were designed by George McLeod with technical assistance of Steve Smith.\n\n\"Color Television Interface Adaptor\" and \"Graphic Television Interface Adaptor\" are names of the chips as stated in the Atari field service manual. Various publications named the chips differently, sometimes using the alternative spelling \"Adapter\" or \"Graphics\", or claiming that the \"C\" in \"CTIA\" stands for Colleen/Candy and \"G\" in \"GTIA\" is for George.\n\nAtari had built their first display driver chip, the Television Interface Adaptor but universally referred to as the TIA, as part of the Atari 2600 console. The TIA display logically consisted of two primary sets of objects, the \"players\" and \"missiles\" that represented moving objects, and the \"playfield\" which represented the static background image on which the action took place. The chip used data in memory registers to produce digital signals that were converted in realtime via a digital-to-analog converter and RF modulator to produce a television display.\n\nThe conventional way to draw the playfield is to use a bitmap held in a frame buffer, in which each memory location in the frame buffer represents one or more locations on the screen. In the case of the 2600, which normally used a resolution of 160x192 pixels, a frame buffer would need to have at least 160x192/8 = 3840 bytes of memory. Built in an era where RAM was very expensive, the TIA could not afford this solution.\n\nInstead, the system implemented a display system that used a single 20-bit memory register that could be copied or mirrored on the right half of the screen to make what was effectively a 40-bit display. Each location could be displayed in one of four colors, from a palette of 128 possible colors. The TIA also included several other display objects, the \"players\" and \"missiles\". These consisted of two 8-bit wide objects known as \"players\", a single 1-bit object known as the \"ball\", and two 1-bit \"missiles\". All of these objects could be moved to arbitrary horizontal locations via settings in other registers.\n\nThe key to the TIA system, and the 2600's low price, was that the system implemented only enough memory to draw a single line of the display, all of which held in registers. To draw an entire screen full of data, the user code would wait until the television display reached the right side of the screen and update the registers for the playfield and player/missiles to correctly reflect the next line on the display. This technique drew the screen line-by-line from program code on the ROM cartridge, a technique known as \"racing the beam\".\n\nAtari initially estimated that the 2600 would have short market lifetime of three years when it was designed in 1976, which meant the company would need a new design by 1979. Initially this new design was simply an updated 2600-like game console, and was built around a similar basic design, simply updated. Work on what would become the CTIA started in 1977, and aimed at delivering a system with twice the resolution and twice the number of colours. Moreover, by varying the number of colours in the playfield, much higher resolutions up to 320 pixels horizontally could be supported. Players and missiles were also updated, including four 8-bit players and four 2-bit missiles, but also allowing an additional mode to combine the four missiles into a fifth player.\n\nShortly after design began, the home computer revolution started in earnest in the later half of 1977. In response, Atari decided to release two versions of the new machine, a low-end model as a games console, and a high-end version as a home computer. In either role, a more complex playfield would be needed, especially support for character graphics in the computer role. Design of the CTIA was well advanced at this point, so instead of a redesign a clever solution was provided by adding a second chip that would effectively automate the process of racing the beam. Instead of the user's programming updating the CTIA's registers based on its interrupt timing, the new ANTIC would handle this chore, reading data from a framebuffer and feeding that to the CTIA on the fly.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the new chips provide greatly improved number and selection of graphics modes over the TIA. Instead of a single playfield mode with 20 or 40 bits of resolution, the CTIA/ANTIC pair can display six text modes and eight graphics modes with various resolutions and color depths, allowing the programmer to choose a balance between resolution, colours, and memory use for their display.\n\nThe original design of the CTIA chip also included three additional color interpretations of the normal graphics modes. This feature provides alternate expressions of ANTIC's high-resolution graphics modes presenting 1 bit per pixel, 2 colors with one-half color clock wide pixels as 4 bits per pixel, up to 16 colors, two-color clock wide pixels. This feature was ready before the computers' November 1979 debut, but was delayed so much in the development cycle that Atari had already ordered a batch of about 100,000 CTIA chips with the graphics modes missing. Not wanting to throw away the already-produced chips, the company decided to use them in the initial release of the Atari 400 and 800 models in the US market. The CTIA-equipped computers, lacking the 3 extra color modes, were shipped until October–November 1981. From this point, all new Atari units were equipped with the new chip, now called GTIA, that supported the new color interpretation modes.\n\nThe original Atari 800/400 operating system supported the GTIA alternate color interpretation modes from the start, which allowed for easy replacement of the CTIA with the GTIA once it was ready. Atari authorized service centers would install a GTIA chip in CTIA-equipped computers free of charge if the computer was under warranty; otherwise the replacement would cost $62.52.\n\nGTIA was also mounted in all later Atari XL and XE computers and Atari 5200 consoles.\n\nThe list below describes CTIA/GTIA's inherent hardware capabilities meaning the intended functionality of the hardware itself, not including results achieved by CPU-serviced interrupts or display kernels driving frequent register changes.\n\nCTIA/GTIA is a television interface device with the following features:\n\n\nAtari, Inc. intended to combine functions of the ANTIC and GTIA chips in one integrated circuit to reduce production costs of Atari computers and 5200 consoles. Two such prototype circuits were being developed, however none of them entered production.\n\nThe Atari 8-bit computers map CTIA/GTIA to the $D0xx page and the Atari 5200 console maps it to the $C0xx page.\n\nCTIA/GTIA provides 54 Read/Write registers controlling Player/Missile graphics, Playfield colors, joystick triggers, and console keys. Many CTIA/GTIA register addresses have dual purposes performing different functions as a Read vs a Write register. Therefore, no code should read Hardware registers expecting to retrieve the previously written value.\n\nThis problem is solved for many write registers by Operating System Shadow registers implemented in regular RAM as places to store the last value written to registers. Operating System Shadow registers are copied from RAM to the hardware registers during the Vertical Blank. Therefore, any write to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by the value of the Shadow registers during the next Vertical Blank.\n\nSome Write registers do not have corresponding Shadow registers. They can be safely written by an application without the value being overwritten during the vertical blank. If the application needs to know the last state of the register then it is the responsibility of the application to remember what it wrote.\n\nOperating System Shadow registers also exist for some Read registers where reading the value directly from hardware at an unknown stage in the display cycle may return inconsistent results.\n\nIn the individual register listings below the following legend applies:\n\nThese registers specify the horizontal position in color clocks of the left edge (the high bit of the GRAF* byte patterns) of Player/Missile objects. Coordinates are always based on the display hardware's color clock engine, NOT simply the current Playfield display mode. This also means Player/Missile objects can be moved into overscan areas beyond the current Playfield mode.\n\nNote that while Missile objects bit patterns share the same byte for displayed pixels (GRAFM) each Missile can be independently positioned. When the \"fifth Player\" option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) turning the four Missiles into one \"Player\" the Missiles switch from displaying the color of the associated Player object to displaying the value of COLPF3. The new \"Player's\" position on screen must be set by specifying the position of each Missile individually.\n\nPlayer/Missile pixels are only rendered within the visible portions of the GTIA's pixel engine. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the horizontal blank or the vertical blank. However, an object can be partially within the horizontal blank. The objects' pixels that fall outside of the horizontal blank are then within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions. The horizontal position range of visible color clocks is $22/34 to $DD/221.\n\nTo remove a Player/Missile object from the visible display area horizontal positions (left) 0 and (right) $DE/222 (or greater) will insure no pixels are rendered regardless of the size of the Player/Missile object and so no unintentional collisions can be flagged.\n\nHorizontal Position of Player 0\n\nHorizontal Position of Player 1\n\nHorizontal Position of Player 2\n\nHorizontal Position of Player 3\n\nHorizontal Position of Missile 0\n\nHorizontal Position of Missile 1\n\nHorizontal Position of Missile 2\n\nHorizontal Position of Missile 3\nBelow are the color clock coordinates of the left and right edges of the possible Playfield sizes, useful when aligning Player/Missile objects to Playfield components:\n\nThree sizes can be chosen: Normal, Double, and Quad width. The left edge (See Horizontal Coordinates) is fixed and the size adjustment expands the Player or Missile toward the right in all cases.\n\n\nNote that in Quad size a single Player/Missile pixel is the same width as an Antic Mode 2 text character. Player/Missile priority selection mixed with Quad width Player Missile graphics can be used to create multiple text colors per Mode line.\n\nEach Player has its own size control register:\n\nSize of Player 0\n\nSize of Player 1\n\nSize of Player 2\n\nSize of Player 3\n\nPlayer size controls:\n\nValues:\n\nAll Missile sizes are controlled by one register, but each Missile can be sized independently of the others. When the \"fifth Player\" option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) turning the four Missiles into one \"Player\" the width is still set by specifying the size for each Missile individually.\n\nValues:\n\nEach Player object has its own 8-bit pattern register. Missile objects share one register with 2 bits per each Missile. Once a value is set it will continue to be displayed on each scan line. With no other intervention by CPU or ANTIC DMA to update the values the result is vertical stripe patterns the height of the screen including overscan areas. This mode of operation does not incur a CPU or DMA toll on the computer. It is useful for displaying alternate colored borders and vertical lines separating screen regions.\n\nGraphics pattern for Player 0\n\nGraphics pattern for Player 1\n\nGraphics pattern for Player 2\n\nGraphics pattern for Player 3\n\nEach Player is 8 bits (pixels) wide. Where a bit is set, a pixel is displayed in the color assigned to the color register associated to the Player. Where a bit is not set the Player object is transparent, showing Players, Missiles, Playfield pixels, or the background color. Pixel output begins at the horizontal position specified by the Player's HPOS value with the highest bit output first.\n\nGraphics pattern for all Missiles\n\nEach Missile is 2 bits (pixels) wide. Where a bit is set, a pixel is displayed in the color assigned to the color register for the Player associated to the Missile. When Fifth Player is enabled (see PRIOR/GPRIOR) the Missiles pixels all display COLPF3. Where a bit is not set the Missile object is transparent, showing Players, Missiles, Playfield pixels, or the background color. Pixel output begins at the horizontal position specified by the Missile's HPOS value with the highest bit output first.\n\nMissile Values:\n\nCTIA/GTIA has 60 bits providing automatic detection of collisions when Player, Missile, and Playfield pixels intersect. A single bit indicates a non-zero pixel of the Player/Missile object has intersected a pixel of a specific color register. There is no collision registered for pixels rendered using the background color register/value. This system provides instant, pixel-perfect overlap comparison without expensive CPU evaluation of bounding box or image bitmap masking.\n\nThe actual color value of an object is not considered. If Player, Missile, Playfield, and Background color registers are all the same value making the objects effectively \"invisible\", the intersections of objects will still register collisions. This is useful for making hidden or secret objects and walls.\n\nObscured intersections will also register collisions. If a Player object priority is behind a Playfield color register and another Player object priority is higher (foreground) than the Playfield, and the foreground Player pixels obscure both the Playfield and the Player object behind the Playfield, then the collision between the Playfield and both the background and foreground Player objects will register along with the collision between the foreground and background Player objects.\n\nNote that there is no Missile to Missile collision.\n\nPlayer/Missile collisions can only occur when Player/Missile object pixels occur within the visible portions of the display. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the horizontal blank or the vertical blank. The range of visible color clocks is 34 to 221, and the visible scan lines range from line 8 through line 247. Player/Missile data outside of these coordinates are not rendered and will not register collisions. An object can be partially within the horizontal blank. The objects' pixels that fall outside of the horizontal blank are within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions.\n\nTo remove a Player/Missile object from the visible display area horizontal positions (left) 0 and (right) 222 (or greater) will insure no pixels are rendered regardless of the size of the Player/Missile object and so no unintentional collisions can be flagged.\n\nFinally, Player, Missile, and Playfield objects collision detection is real-time, registering a collision as the image pixels are merged and output for display. Checking an object's collision bits before the object has been rendered by CTIA/GTIA will show no collision.\n\nOnce set, collisions remain in effect until cleared by writing to the HITCLR register. Effective collision response routines should occur after the targeted objects have been displayed, or at the end of a frame or during the Vertical Blank to react to the collisions and clear collisions before the next frame begins.\n\nBecause collisions are only a single bit, collisions are quite obviously not additive. No matter how many times and different locations a collision between pixels occurs within one frame there is only 1 bit to indicate there was a collision. A set collision bit informs a program that it can examine the related objects to identify collision locations and then decide how to react for each location.\n\nSince HITCLR and collision detection is real-time, Display List Interrupts can divide the display into sections with HITCLR used at the beginning of each section and separate collision evaluation at the end of each section.\n\nWhen the \"fifth Player\" option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) the only change is the Missiles 0 to 3 switch from displaying the color of the associated Player object to displaying the value of COLPF3. The new \"Player's\" collisions are still reported for the individual Missiles.\n\nEach bit indicates a pixel of the Player/Missile object has intersected a pixel of the specified Playfield color object. There is no collision registered for the background color.\n\nObscured intersections will also register collisions. If a Player/Missile object priority is behind a Playfield color register and another Player/Missile object priority is higher (foreground) than the Playfield, and the foreground Player/Missile pixels obscure both the Playfield and the Player/Missile object behind the Playfield, then the collision between the Playfield and both the background and foreground Player/Missile objects will register.\n\nHigh-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixel modes (ANTIC Modes 2, 3, and F) are treated differently. The \"background\" color rendered as COLPF2 where pixel values are 0 does not register a collision. High-resolution pixels are rendered as the luminance value from COLPF1. The pixels are grouped together in color clock-wide pairs (pixels 0 and 1, pixels 2 and 3, continuing to pixels 318 and 319). Where either pixel of the pair is 1 a collision is detected between the Player or Missile pixels and Playfield color COLPF2.\n\nGTIA modes 9 and 11 do not process playfield collisions. In GTIA mode 10 Playfield collisions will register where Playfield pixels use COLPF0 through COLPF3\n\nMissile 0 to Playfield collisions\n\nMissile 1 to Playfield collisions\n\nMissile 2 to Playfield collisions\n\nMissile 3 to Playfield collisions\n\nPlayer 0 to Playfield collisions\n\nPlayer 1 to Playfield collisions\n\nPlayer 2 to Playfield collisions\n\nPlayer 3 to Playfield collisions\n\nMissiles collide with Players and Playfields. There is no Missile to Missile collision.\n\nMissile 0 to Player collisions\n\nMissile 1 to Player collisions\n\nMissile 2 to Player collisions\n\nMissile 3 to Player collisions\n\nA collision between two players sets the collision bit in both Players' collision registers. When Player 0 and Player 1 collide, Player 0's collision bit for Player 1 is set, and Player 1's collision bit for Player 0 is set.\n\nA Player cannot collide with itself, so its bit is always 0.\n\nPlayer 0 to Player collisions\nPlayer 1 to Player collisions\nPlayer 2 to Player collisions\n\nPlayer 3 to Player collisions\n\nAll Player/Missile objects' pixels and all Playfield pixels in the default CTIA/GTIA color interpretation mode use indirection to specify color. Indirection means that the values of the pixel data do not directly specify the color, but point to another source of information for color. CTIA/GTIA contain hardware registers that set the values used for colors, and the pixels' information refer to these registers. The palette on the Atari is 8 luminance levels of 16 colors for a total 128 colors. The color indirection flexibility allows a program to tailor the screen's colors to fit the purpose of the program's display.\n\nAll hardware color registers have corresponding shadow registers.\n\nSHADOW: PCOLOR0 $02C0\n\nColor/luminance of Player and Missile 0.\n\nWhen GTIA 9-color mode is enabled (PRIOR/GPRIOR value $80) this register is used for the border and background (Playfield pixel value 0), rather than COLBK.\n\nSHADOW: PCOLOR1 $02C1\n\nColor/luminance of Player and Missile 1.\n\nSHADOW: PCOLOR2 $02C2\n\nColor/luminance of Player and Missile 2.\n\nSHADOW: PCOLOR3 $02C3\n\nColor/luminance of Player and Missile 3.\n\nSHADOW: COLOR0 $02C4\n\nColor/luminance of Playfield 0.\n\nSHADOW: COLOR1 $02C5\n\nColor/luminance of Playfield 1.\n\nThis register is used for the set pixels (value 1) in ANTIC text modes 2 and 3, and map mode F. Only the luminance portion is used and is OR'd with the color value of COLPF2. In other Character and Map modes this register provides the expected color and luminance for a pixel.\n\nSHADOW: COLOR2 $02C6\n\nColor/luminance of Playfield 2.\n\nThis register is used for Playfield background color of ANTIC text modes 2 and 3, and map mode F. That is, where pixel value 0 is used. In other Character and Map modes this register provides the expected color and luminance for a pixel.\n\nSHADOW: COLOR3 $02C7\n\nColor/luminance of Playfield 3\n\nCOLPF3 is available is several special circumstances: \n\nSHADOW: COLOR4 $02C8\n\nColor/luminance of Playfield background.\n\nThe background color is displayed where no other pixel occurs through the entire overscan display area. The following exceptions occur for the background:\n\nColor Registers' Bits:\n\nThe high nybble of the color register specifies one of 16 colors color ($00, $10, $20... to $F0). \nThe low nybble of the register specifies one of 16 luminance values ($00, $01, $02... to $0F).\n\nIn the normal color interpretation mode the lowest bit is not significant and only 8 luminance values are available ($00, $02, $04, $06, $08, $0A, $0C, $0E), so the complete color palette is 128 color values.\n\nIn GTIA color interpretation mode $4 (luminance-only mode) the full 16 bits of luminance values are available for Playfield pixels providing a palette of 256 colors. Any Player/Missile objects displayed in this mode are colored by indirection which still uses the 128 color palette.\n\nIn normal color interpretation mode the pixel values range from $0 to $3 ordinarily pointing to color registers COLBK, COLPF0, COLPF1, COLPF2 respectively. The color text modes also include options to use COLPF3 for certain ranges of character values. See ANTIC's graphics modes for more information.\n\nWhen Player/Missile graphics patterns are enabled for display where the graphics patterns bits are set the color displayed comes from the registers assigned to the objects.\n\nThere are exceptions for color generation and display: \n\nColor Registers' Use per ANTIC Character Modes:\n\nColor Registers' Use per ANTIC Map Modes:\n\nColor Registers' Use per GTIA Modes (ANTIC F):\n\nPlayer/Missile colors are always available for Player/Missile objects in all modes, though colors may be modified when the special GTIA modes (16 shades/16 color) are in effect.\n\nSHADOW: GPRIOR $026F\n\nThis register controls several CTIA/GTIA color management features: The GTIA Playfield color interpretation mode, Multi-Color Player objects, the Fifth Player, and Player/Missile/Playfield priority.\n\nGTIA Playfield Color Interpretations<br>\nCTIA includes only one default color interpretation mode for the ANTIC Playfield data stream. That is the basic functionality assumed in the majority of the ANTIC and CTIA/GTIA discussion unless otherwise noted. GTIA includes three alternate color interpretations modes for Playfield data. These modes work by pairing adjacent color clocks from ANTIC, thus the pixels output by GTIA are always two color clocks wide. Although these modes can be engaged while displaying any ANTIC Playfield Mode, the full color palette possible with these GTIA color processing options are only realized in the ANTIC Modes based on 1/2 color clock pixels (ANTIC modes 2, 3, F.) These GTIA options are most often used with a Mode F display. The special GTIA color processing modes also alter the display or behavior of Player/Missile graphics in various ways.\n\nThe color interpretation control is a global function of GTIA affecting the entire screen. GTIA is not inherently capable of mixing on one display the various GTIA color interpretation modes and the default CTIA mode needed for most ANTIC Playfields. Mixing color interpretation modes requires software writing to the PRIOR register as the display is generated (usually, by a Display List Interrupt).\n\nPRIOR bits 7 and 6 provide four values specifying the color interpretation modes:\n\n16 Shades<br>\nThis mode uses the COLBK register to specify the background color. Rather than using indirection, pixel values directly represent Luminance. This mode allows all four luminance bits to be used in the Atari color palette and so is capable of displaying 256 colors.\n\nPlayer/Missile graphics (without the fifth Player option) display properly in this mode, however collision detection with the Playfield is disabled. Playfield priority is always on the bottom. When the Missiles are switched to act as a fifth Player then where the Missile objects overlap the Playfield the Missile pixels luminance merges with the Playfield pixels' Luminance value.\n\n9 Color<br>\nUnlike the other two special GTIA modes, this mode is entirely driven by color indirection. All nine color registers work on the display for pixel values 0 through 8. The remaining 7 pixel values repeat previous color registers.\n\nThe pixels are delayed by one color clock (half a GTIA mode pixel) when output. This offset permits interesting effects. For an example, page flipping rapidly between this mode and a different GTIA mode produces a display with apparent higher resolution and greater number of colors.\n\nThis mode is unique in that is uses color register COLPM0 for the border and background (Playfield 0 value pixels) rather than COLBK.\n\nPlayer/Missile graphics display properly with the exception that Player/Missile 0 are not distinguishable from the background pixels, since they use the same color register, COLPM0. The Playfield pixels using the Player/Missile colors are modified by priority settings as if they were Player/Missile objects and so can affect the display of Players/Missiles. (See discussion later about Player/Missile/Playfield priorities).\n\nThe Playfield pixels using Player/Missile colors do not trigger collisions when Player/Missile objects overlay them. However, Player/Missile graphics overlapping Playfield colors COLPF0 to COLPF3 will trigger the expected collision.\n\n16 Colors<br>\nThis mode uses the COLBK register to specify the luminance of all Playfield pixels (values $1/1 through $F/15.) The least significant bit of the luminance value is not observed, so only the standard/CTIA 8 luminance values are available ($0, $2, $4, $6, $8, $A, $C, $E). Additionally, the background itself uses only the color component set in the COLBK register. The luminance value of the background is forced to 0. As with the Luminance mode indirection is disabled and pixel values directly represent a color.\n\nNote that the color component of the background also merges with the playfield pixels. Colors other than black for the background reduce the overall number of colors displayed in the mode.\nPlayer/Missile graphics (without the fifth Player option) display properly in this mode, however collision detection with the Playfield is disabled. Playfield priority is always on the bottom. When the Missiles are switched to act as a fifth Player then where the Missile objects overlap the Playfield the Missile pixels inherit the Playfield pixels' Color value.\n\nMulti-Color Player<br>\nPRIOR bit 5, value $20/32 enables Multi-Color Player objects. Where pixels of two Player/Missile objects overlap a third color appears. This is implemented by eliminating priority processing between pairs of Player/Missile objects resulting in CTIA/GTIA performing a bitwise OR of the two colored pixels to output a new color.\n\nExample: A Player pixel with color value $98/152 (blue) overlaps a Player pixel with color value $46/70 (red) resulting in a pixel color of $DE/228 (light green/yellow).\n\nThe Players/Missiles pairs capable of Multi-Color output: \n\nFifth Player<br>\nPRIOR bit 4, value $10/16 enables Missiles to become a fifth Player. No functional change occurs to the Missile other than the color processing of the Missiles. Normally the Missiles display using the color of the associated Player. When Fifth Player is enabled all Missiles display the color of Playfield 3 (COLPF3). Horizontal position, size, vertical delay, and Player/Missile collisions all continue to operate the same way. The priority of the Fifth Player for Player objects pixel intersections is COLPF3, but the Fifth Player's pixels have priority over all Playfield colors.\n\nThe color processing change also causes some exceptions for the Missiles' display in GTIA's alternative color modes:\n\nThe Fifth Player introduces an exception for Priority value $8 (bits 1000) (See Priority discussion below.)\n\nPriority<br>\nPRIOR bits 3 to 0 provide four Player/Missile and Playfield priority values that determine which pixel value is displayed when Player/Missile objects pixels and Playfield pixels intersect. The four values provide specific options listed in the Priority chart below. \"PM\" mean normal Player/Missile implementation without the Fifth Player. The Fifth Player, \"P5\", is shown where its priority occurs when it is enabled.\n\nThe chart is accurate for ANTIC Playfield Character and Map modes using the default (CTIA) color interpretation mode. GTIA color interpretation modes, and the ANTIC modes based on high-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixels behave differently (noted later).\n\nIf multiple bits are set, then where there is a conflict CTIA/GTIA outputs a black pixel—Note that black means actual black, not simply the background color, COLBK.\n\nAlthough the Fifth Player is displayed with the value of COLPF3, its priority is above all Playfield colors. This produces an exception for Priority value $8 (Bits 1000). In this mode Playfield 0 and 1 are higher priority than the Players, and the Players are higher priority than Playfield 2 and 3. Where Playfield 0 or 1 pixels intersect any Player pixel the result displayed is the Playfield pixel. However, if the Fifth player also intersects the same location, its value is shown over the Playfield causing it to appear as if Playfield 3 has the highest priority. If the Playfield 0 or 1 pixel is removed from this intersection then the Fifth Player's pixel has no Playfield pixel to override and so also falls behind the Player pixels.\n\nWhen the Priority bits are all 0 a different effect occurs—Player and Playfield pixels are logically OR'd together in the a manner similar to the Multi-Color Player feature. In this situation Players 0 and 1 pixels can mix with Playfield 0 and 1 pixels, and Players 2 and 3 pixels can mix with Playfield 2 and 3 pixels. Additionally, when the Multi-Color Player option is used the resulting merged Players' color can also mix with the Playfield producing more colors. When all color merging possibilities are considered, the CTIA/GTIA hardware can output 23 colors per scan line. Starting with the background color as the first color, the remaining 22 colors and color merges are possible:\n\nWhen Priority bits are all 0 the Missiles colors function the same way as the corresponding Players as described above. When Fifth Player is enabled, the Missile pixels cause the same color merging as shown for COLPF3 in the table above (colors 19 through 22).\n\nPriority And High-Resolution Modes<br>\nThe priority result differ for the Character and Map modes using high-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixels—ANTIC modes 2, 3, and F. These priority handling differences can be exploited to produce color text or graphics in these modes that are traditionally thought of as \"monochrome\".\n\nIn these ANTIC modes COLPF2 is output as the \"background\" of the Playfield and COLBK is output as the border around the Playfield. The graphics or glyph pixels are output using only the luminance component of COLPF1 mixed with the color component of the background (usually COLPF2).\n\nThe priority relationship between Players/Missiles, and COLPF2 work according to the priority chart below. Player/Missile pixels with higher priorities will replace COLPF2 as the \"background\" color. COLPF1 always has the highest priority and cannot be obscured by Players or Missiles. The glyph/graphics pixels use the color component of highest priority color (Playfield, Player, or Missile), and the luminance component of COLPF1. Note that this behavior is also consistent where Player/Missile priority conflicts result in true black for the \"background\". In effect, the color value CTIA/GTIA finally uses for the \"background\" color \"tints\" the COLPF1 foreground glyph/graphics pixels.\n\nVertical Delay P/M Graphics\n\nThis register is used to provide single scan line movement when Double Line Player/Missile resolution is enabled in ANTIC's DMACTL register. This works by masking ANTIC DMA updates to the GRAF* registers on even scan lines, causing the graphics pattern to shift down one scan line.\n\nSince Single Line resolution requires ANTIC DMA updates on each scan line and VDELAY masks the updates on even scan lines, then this bit reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution to Double line.\n\nGraphics Control\n\nGRACTL controls CTIA/GTIA's receipt of Player/Missile DMA data from ANTIC and toggles the mode of Joystick trigger input.\n\nReceipt of Player/Missile DMA data requires CTIA/GTIA be configured to receive the data. This is done with a pair of bits in GRACTL that match a pair of bits in ANTIC's DMACTL register that direct ANTIC to send Player data and Missile data. GRACTL's Bit 0 corresponds to DMACTL's Bit 2, enabling transfer of Missile data. GRACTL's Bit 1 corresponds to DMACTL's Bit 3, enabling transfer of Player data. These bits must be set for GTIA to receive Player/Missile data from ANTIC via DMA. When Player/Missile graphics are being operated directly by the CPU then these bits must be off.\n\nThe joystick trigger registers report the pressed/not pressed state in real-time. If a program's input polling may not be frequent enough to catch momentary joystick button presses, then the triggers can be set to lock in the closed/pressed state and remain in that state even after the button is released. Setting GRACTL Bit 2 enables the latching of all triggers. Clearing the bit returns the triggers to the unlatched, real-time behavior.\n\nClear Collisions\n\nAny write to this register clears all the Player/Missile collision detection bits.\n\nSHADOW: STRIG0 $0284\n\nJoystick 0 trigger\n\nSHADOW: STRIG1 $0285\n\nJoystick 1 trigger.\n\nSHADOW: STRIG2 $0286\n\nJoystick 2 trigger.\n\nSHADOW: STRIG3 $0287\n\nJoystick 3 trigger\n\nBits 7 through 1 are always 0. Bit 0 reports the state of the joystick trigger. Value 1 indicates the trigger is not pressed. Value 0 indicates the trigger is pressed.\n\nThe trigger registers report button presses in real-time. The button pressed state will instantly clear when the button is released.\n\nThe triggers may be configured to latch, that is, lock, in the pressed state and remain that way until specifically cleared. GRACTL bit 2 enables the latch behavior for all triggers. Clearing GRACTL bit 2 returns all triggers to real-time behavior.\n\nPAL flags.\n\nThis register reports the display standard for the system. When Bits 3 to 0 are set to 1 (value $f/15) the system is operating in NTSC. When the bits are zero the system is operating in PAL mode.\n\nConsole Speaker\n\nBit3 controls the internal speaker of the Atari 800/400. In later models the console speaker is removed and the sound is mixed with the regular POKEY audio signals for output to the monitor port and RF adapter. The Atari OS uses the console speaker to output the keyboard click and the bell/buzzer sound.\n\nThe Operating System sets the speaker bit during the Vertical Blank routine. Repeatedly writing 0 to the bit will produce a 60 Hz buzzing sound as the Vertical Blank resets the value. Useful tones can be generated using 6502 code effectively adding a fifth audio channel, albeit a channel requiring CPU time to maintain the audio tones.\n\nConsole Keys\n\nA bit is assigned to report the state of each of the special console keys, Start, Select, and Option. Bit value 0 indicates a key is pressed and 1 indicates the key is not pressed. Key/Bit values:\n\n\nA hardware \"sprite\" system is handled by CTIA/GTIA. The official ATARI name for the sprite system is \"Player/Missile Graphics\", since it was designed to reduce the need to manipulate display memory for fast-moving objects, such as the \"player\" and his weapons, \"missiles\", in a shoot 'em up game.\n\nA Player is essentially a glyph 8 pixels wide and 256 TV lines tall, and has two colors: the background (transparent) (codice_1 in the glyph) and the foreground (codice_2). A Missile object is similar, but only 2 pixels wide. CTIA/GTIA combines the Player/Missile objects' pixels with the Playfield pixels according to their priority. Transparent (codice_1) player pixels have no effect on the Playfield and display either a Playfield or background pixel without change. All Player/Missile objects' normal pixel width is one color clock. A register value can set the Player or Missile pixels' width to 1, 2, or 4 color clocks wide.\n\nThe Player/Missile implementation by CTIA/GTIA is similar to the TIA's. A Player is an 8-bit value or pattern at a specified horizontal position which automatically repeats for each scan line or until the pattern is changed in the register. Missiles are 2-bits wide and share one pattern register, so that four, 2-bit wide values occupy the 8-bit wide pattern register, but each missile has an independent horizontal position and size. Player/Missile objects extend the height of the display including the screen border. That is, the default implementation of Player/Missile graphics by CTIA/GTIA is a stripe down the screen. While seemingly limited this method facilitates Player/Missile graphics use as alternate colored vertical borders or separators on a display, and when priority values are set to put Player/Missile pixels behind playfield pixels they can be used to add additional colors to a display. All Players and Missiles set at maximum width and placed side by side can cover the entire normal width Playfield.\n\nCTIA/GTIA supports several options controlling Player/Missile color. The PRIOR/GPRIOR register value can switch the four Missiles between two color display options—each Missile (0 to 3) expresses the color of the associated Player object (0 to 3) or all Missiles show the color of register COLPF3/COLOR3. When Missiles are similarly colored they can be treated as a fifth player, but correct placement on screen still requires storing values in all four Missile Horizontal Position registers. PRIOR/GPRIOR also controls a feature that causes the overlapping pixels of two Players to generate a third color allowing multi-colored Player objects at the expense of reducing the number of available objects. Finally, PRIOR/GPRIOR can be used to change the foreground/background layering (called, \"priority\") of Player/Missile pixels vs Playfield pixels, and can create priority conflicts that predictably affect the colors displayed.\n\nThe conventional idea of a sprite with an image/pattern that varies vertically is also built into the Player/Missile graphics system. The ANTIC chip includes a feature to perform DMA to automatically feed new pixel patterns to CTIA/GTIA as the display is generated. This can be done for each scan line or every other scan line resulting in Player/Missile pixels one or two scan lines tall. In this way the Player/Missile object could be considered an extremely tall character in a font, 8 bits/pixels wide, by the height of the display.\n\nMoving the Player/Missile objects horizontally is as simple as changing a register in the CTIA/GTIA (in Atari BASIC, a single POKE statement moves a player or missile horizontally). Moving an object vertically is achieved by either block moving the definition of the glyph to a new location in the Player or Missile bitmap, or by rotating the entire Player/Missile bitmap (128 or 256 bytes). The worst case rotation of the entire bitmap is still quite fast in 6502 machine language, even though the 6502 lacks a block-move instruction found in the 8080. Since the sprite is exactly 128 or 256 bytes long, the indexing can be easily accommodated in a byte-wide register on the 6502. Atari BASIC lacks a high speed memory movement command and moving memory using BASIC PEEK()s and POKE(s) is painfully slow. Atari BASIC programs using Player/Missile graphics have other options for performing high speed memory moves. One method is calling a short machine language routine via the USR() function to perform the memory moves. Another option is utilizing a large string as the Player/Missile memory map and performing string copy commands which result in memory movement at machine language speed.\n\nCareful use of Player/Missile graphics with the other graphics features of the Atari hardware can make graphics programming, particularly games, significantly simpler.\n\nThe GTIA chip is backward compatible with the CTIA, and adds 3 color interpretations for the 14 \"normal\" ANTIC Playfield graphics modes. The normal color interpretation of the CTIA chip is limited, per scanline, to a maximum of 4 colors in Map modes or 5 colors in Text modes (plus 4 colors for Player/Missile graphics) unless special programming techniques are used. The three, new color interpretations in GTIA provide a theoretical total of 56 graphics modes (14 ANTIC modes multiplied by four possible color interpretations). However, only the graphics modes based on high-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixels (that is, Antic text modes 2, 3, and graphics mode F) are capable of fully expressing the color palettes of these 3 new color interpretations. The three additional color interpretations use the information in two color clocks (four bits) to generate a pixel in one of 16 color values. This changes a mode F display from 2 colors per pixel, 320 pixels horizontally, one scan line per mode line, to 16 colors and 80 pixels horizontally. The additional color interpretations allow the following:\n\nOf these modes, Atari BASIC Graphics 9 is particularly notable. It enables the Atari to display gray-scale digitized photographs, which despite their low resolution were very impressive at the time. Additionally, by allowing 16 shades of a single hue rather than the 8 shades available in other graphics modes, it increases the amount of different colors the Atari could display from 128 to 256. Unfortunately, this feature is limited for use in this mode only, which due to its low resolution was not widely used.\n\nThe Antic 2 and 3 text modes are capable of displaying the same color ranges as mode F graphics when using the GTIA's alternate color interpretations. However, since the pixel reduction also applies and turns 8 pixel wide, 2 color text into 2 pixel wide, 16 color blocks these modes are unsuitable for actual text, and so these graphics modes are not popular outside of demos. Effective use of the GTIA color interpretation feature with text modes requires a carefully constructed character set treating characters as pixels. This method allows display of an apparent GTIA \"high resolution\" graphics mode that would ordinarily occupy 8K of RAM to instead use only about 2K (1K for the character set, and 1K for the screen RAM and display list.)\n\nThe GTIA also fixed an error in CTIA that caused graphics to be misaligned by \"half a color clock\". The side effect of the fix was that programs that relied on color artifacts in high-resolution monochrome modes would show a different pair of colors.\n\nAtari owners can determine if their machine is equipped with the CTIA or GTIA by executing the BASIC command codice_4. If the screen blackens after execution, the machine is equipped with the new GTIA chip. If it stays blue, the machine has a CTIA chip instead.\n\nThe last Atari XE computers made for the Eastern European market were built in China. Many if not all have a buggy PAL GTIA chip. The luma values in Graphics 9 and higher are at fault, appearing as stripes. Replacing the chip fixes the problem. Also, there have been attempts to fix faulty GTIA chips with some external circuitry.\n\nThe following is a summary of hardware/feature limitations some of which can be circumvented by software (display list interrupts or display kernels.):\n\nThe display generator outputs pixels within the horizontal range $22/34 to $DD/221. (188 color clocks wide). Player/Missile pixels outside this range are not generated and so do not register collisions.\n\nFour Player objects 8 bits wide, and four Missile objects 2 bits wide per scan line.\n\nOne Player/Missile bit may be 1, 2, or 4 color clocks wide.\n\nWhile the additional GTIA color interpretation modes can be enabled for any kind of ANTIC Playfield graphics, the full range of color capability is available only in the ANTIC modes based on high-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixels (that is, ANTIC text modes 2, 3, and graphics mode F).\n\nThe color palette is 128 colors (8 shades of 16 colors) for normal color interpretation mode, and GTIA modes $8 and $C (BASIC GRAPHICS mode 10 and 11).\n\nThe color palette is 256 colors (16 shades of 16 colors) for GTIA color interpretation mode $4 (BASIC GRAPHICS mode 9).\n\n9 color registers are available—four for Players/Missiles, four for Playfield pixels, and one register (COLPF3) shared by the Playfield and Fifth Player option.\n\nThe color produced from merging multiple Players and merging Player/Missile and Playfield graphics is the result of binary OR'ing the two source colors which limits the resulting, merged color value.\nAll Playfield and Player/Missile color registers plus the Multi-Color Player option combined with the Priority option merging Player/Missile and Playfield colors generate 23 colors per scan line.\n\nWhile GTIA pixels have 16 values ($0 to $F) color interpretation mode $8 (BASIC GRAPHICS mode 10) can use only 9 pixel values—one per color register.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "933889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=933889", "title": "Sundae", "text": "Sundae\n\nThe sundae () is an ice cream dessert. It typically consists of one or more scoops of ice cream topped with sauce or syrup, and in some cases other toppings including sprinkles, whipped cream, marshmallows, peanuts, maraschino cherries, or other fruits (e.g., bananas and pineapple in a banana split.).\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the origin of the term \"sundae\" is obscure; however, it is generally accepted that the spelling \"sundae\" derives from the English word \"Sunday\".\n\nAmong the many stories about the invention of the sundae, a frequent theme is that the ice cream sundae was a variation of the popular ice cream soda. According to documentation published by the Evanston Public Library (Illinois), the drinking of soda was outlawed on Sundays in Illinois.\n\nOther origin stories for the sundae focus on the novelty or inventiveness of the treat or the name of the originator, and make no mention of legal pressures.\n\nIce cream sundae soon became the weekend semi-official soda fountain confection in the beginning of the 1900s and quickly gained popularity. \"The Ice Cream Trade Journal\" for 1909 along with plain, or French sundae, listed such exotic varieties as Robin Hood sundae, Cocoa Caramel sundae, Black Hawk sundae, Angel Cake sundae, Cherry Dip sundae, Cinnamon Peak sundae, Opera sundae, Fleur D'Orange sundae, Knickerbocker sundae, Tally-Ho Sundae, Bismarck and George Washington sundaes, to name a few.\n\nVarious localities have claimed to be the birthplace of the ice cream sundae, including Plainfield, Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and New York City.\n\nTwo Rivers claim is based on the story of George Hallauer asking Edward C. Berners, the owner of Berners' Soda Fountain, to drizzle chocolate syrup over ice cream in 1881. Berners eventually did and wound up selling the treat for a nickel, originally only on Sundays, but later every day. According to this story, the spelling changed when a glass salesman ordered canoe-shaped dishes. When Berners died in 1939, the \"Chicago Tribune\" headlined his obituary \"Man Who Made First Ice Cream Sundae Is Dead\". Two Ithaca High School students, however, claim that Berners would have only been 16 or 17 in 1881, so it is therefore \"improbable\" that he would have owned an ice cream shop in that year. They also state that the obituary dates Berners' first sundae to 1899 rather than 1881.\n\nResidents of Two Rivers have contested the claims of other cities to the right to claim the title \"birthplace of the ice cream sundae\". When Ithaca, New York, mayor Carolyn K. Peterson proclaimed a day to celebrate her city as the birthplace of the sundae, she received postcards from Two Rivers' citizens reiterating that town's claim.\n\nBuffalos Stoddart Bros. Drug Store advertised serving up ice cream sodas garnished with fruit syrup and whipped cream in the pages of The Buffalo Evening News and the Buffalo Courier, as early as 1889.\n\nEvanston was one of the first locations to pass a blue law against selling ice cream sodas in 1890. \"Some ingenious confectioners and drug store operators [in Evanston]... obeying the law, served ice cream with the syrup of your choice without the soda [on Sundays]. Thereby complying with the law… This sodaless soda was the Sunday soda.\" As sales of the dessert continued on Mondays, local Methodist leaders then objected to naming the dish after the Sabbath, so the spelling of the name was changed to sundae.\n\nSupporting Ithacas claim to be \"the birthplace of the ice cream sundae\", researchers at The History Center in Tompkins County, New York, provide an account of how the sundae came to be: On Sunday, April 3, 1892, in Ithaca, John M. Scott, a Unitarian Church minister, and Chester Platt, co-owner of Platt & Colt Pharmacy, created the first historically documented sundae. Platt covered dishes of ice cream with cherry syrup and candied cherries on a whim. The men named the dish \"Cherry Sunday\" in honor of the day it was created. The oldest-known written evidence of a sundae is Platt & Colt's newspaper ad for a \"Cherry Sunday\" placed in the \"Ithaca Daily Journal\" on April 5, 1892. By May 1892, the Platt & Colt soda fountain also served \"Strawberry Sundays\" and later, \"Chocolate Sundays\".\n\nPlatt & Colt's \"Sundays\" grew so popular that by 1894, Chester Platt attempted to trademark the term ice cream \"Sunday\".\n\nPlainfield, Illinois has also claimed to be the home of the very first ice cream sundae. A local belief is that a Plainfield druggist named Mr. Sonntag created the dish \"after the urgings of patrons to serve something different.\" He named it the \"sonntag\" after himself, and since \"Sonntag\" means Sunday in German, the name was translated to Sunday, and later was spelled sundae. Charles Sonntag established himself as a pharmacist after graduating from pharmacy school in 1890. He worked for several years under the employ of two local druggists, Dr. David W. Jump and F. R. Tobias. Sonntag established his own pharmacy (as early as 1893 and no later than 1895) in a building constructed in the months following a December 1891 fire that devastated one side of the town's business district. His store advertised \"Sonntag's Famous Soda\" and was, likely, the first soda fountain in the Village of Plainfield.\n\nThe original sundae consists of vanilla ice cream topped with a flavored sauce or syrup, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. Classic sundaes are typically named after flavored syrup employed in the recipe: cherry sundae, chocolate sundae, strawberry sundae, raspberry sundae, etc. The classic sundae is traditionally served in a tulip-shaped, footed glass vase. Due to the long association between the shape of the glass and the dessert, this style of serving dish is generally now known as a sundae glass.\n\nThis dessert consists of two halves of a banana, sliced lengthwise. The classic banana split consists of strawberry ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream topped with crushed pineapple, and vanilla ice cream topped with strawberry syrup. Each scoop is individually garnished with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.\n\nThis is a sundae served in a tall glass filled with layers of ice cream or yogurt, gelatine, and flavorings such as syrups, whipped cream, granola, fresh fruit, and/or liqueurs.\n\nThis ice cream sundae is served in a large tall glass, consisting of layers of ice cream, jelly, and cream, topped with syrup, nuts, whipped cream, and often a cherry; it is popular in the United Kingdom.\n\nSliced or chopped fruit that has been sugared and let to sit for an hour or more to form a sweet syrup may be substituted for the flavored sauce or syrup of the classic sundae. Fresh fruit sundaes include named variations such as the strawberry, peach, raspberry, blueberry, blackberry, and mixed fruit sundaes. Fresh fruit sundaes are generally served during the summer months, and they are sometimes advertised as specialty offerings in agricultural areas where particular fruits are grown.\n\nJarred fruit products are also available which are made specifically for the preparation of ice cream sundaes, often sweetened and in a thickened flavored juice. Sundaes can also be topped with canned fruits.\n\nHeated-sauce sundaes are those in which the flavored sauce or syrup is heated before being poured over the ice cream, creating appealing differences in temperature as well as texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sundae features a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and a scoop of chocolate ice cream with creamy white marshmallow sauce, topped with Spanish peanuts. The Tin Roof Sundae was created in 1916, at the Potter Drug Co., in Potter, Nebraska, owned by pharmacist James Earl Thayer. His son, Harold Dean “Pinky” Thayer, worked in the soda fountain as a teenager, and is credited for inventing the ice cream treat. According to Dr. J.E. Thayer of Sidney, there are two stories of how the sundae got its name. The first is that it was inspired by the tin ceiling in the business; the other is that the stable across the street had a tin roof and that he named it after that. The Tin Roof Sundae can still be enjoyed in Potter, Nebraska, where the Potter Drug Co., now called the Potter Sundry, is still in operation.\n\nThis is a rich sundae made with brownies, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, peanuts, hot fudge, and whipped cream, often topped with maraschino cherry. If a blondie replaces the brownie, then caramel sauce is used as a topping instead of chocolate sauce.\n\nThis sundae consists of vanilla ice cream, crushed strawberry, crushed pineapple, whipped cream, and a cherry. It is named for the protagonist in the 1899 book \"David Harum; A Story of American Life\".\n\n"}
{"id": "934991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=934991", "title": "Body proportions", "text": "Body proportions\n\nWhile there is significant variation in anatomical proportions between people, there are many references to body proportions that are intended to be canonical, either in art, measurement, or medicine.\n\nIn measurement, body proportions are often used to relate two or more measurements based on the body. A cubit, for instance, is supposed to be six palms. A span is taken to be 9 inches and was previously considered as half a cubit. While convenient, these ratios may not reflect the physiognomic variation of the individuals using them.\n\nSimilarly, in art, body proportions are the study of relation of human or animal body parts to each other and to the whole. These ratios are used in depictions of the figure (to varying degrees naturalistic, idealized or stylized), and may become part of an aesthetic canon within a culture.\n\nIt is important in figure drawing to draw the human figure in proportion. Though there are subtle differences between individuals, human proportions fit within a fairly standard range, though artists have historically tried to create idealised standards, which have varied considerably over different periods and regions. In modern figure drawing, the basic unit of measurement is the 'head', which is the distance from the top of the head to the chin. This unit of measurement is reasonably standard, and has long been used by artists to establish the proportions of the human figure. Ancient Egyptian art used a canon of proportion based on the \"fist\", measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead. This was already established by the Narmer Palette from about the 31st century BC, and remained in use until at least the conquest by Alexander the Great some 3,000 years later.\n\nThe proportions used in figure drawing are:\n\n\nA study using Polish participants by Sorokowski found 5% longer legs than an individual used as a reference was considered most attractive. The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of leggy runway models. The Sorokowski study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic.\n\nAnother study using British and American participants, found \"mid-ranging\" leg-to-body ratios to be most ideal.\n\nA study by Swami et al. of American men and women showed a preference for men with legs as long as the rest of their body and women with 40% longer legs than the rest of their body The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture where long-legged women are portrayed as more attractive. The Swami et al. study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic. Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant. Bertamini's own study which used stick figures mirrored Swami's study, however, by finding a preference for leggier women.\n\nAnother common measurement of related to leg-to-body ratio is sitting-height ratio (SHR). Sitting height ratio is the ratio of the head plus spine length to total height which is highly correlated to leg-to-body ratio. SHR has been found to be very different between individuals of different ancestry. It has been reported that individuals with African ancestry have on average longer leg length, i.e. lower SHR than individuals of European ancestry. A study in 2015 revealed that this difference is mainly due to genetic differences and the SHR difference between African and European individuals is as large as 1 standard deviation.\n\nA 1999 study found that \"the (action) figures have grown much more muscular over time, with many contemporary figures far exceeding the muscularity of even the largest human bodybuilders,\" reflecting an American cultural ideal of a super muscular man. Also, female dolls reflect the cultural ideal of thinness in women.\n\nThe ancient Greek sculptor Polykleitos (c.450–420 BC), known for his ideally proportioned bronze \"Doryphoros\", wrote an influential \"Canon\" describing the proportions to be followed in sculpture. \nThe \"Canon\" applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and \"symmetria\" (Greek for \"harmonious proportions\") creating a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions. Polykleitos uses the distal phalanx of the little finger as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body, scaling this length up repeatedly by to obtain the ideal size of the other phalanges, the hand, forearm, and upper arm in turn.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci believed that the ideal human proportions were determined by the harmonious proportions that he believed governed the universe, such that the ideal man would fit cleanly into a circle as depicted in his famed drawing of \"Vitruvian man\" (c. 1492).\n\nLeonardo’s recorded information was about relative body proportions – with comparisons of hand, foot, and other feature’s lengths to other body parts – more than to actual measurements. He was a prodigious note writer and small sketch draftsman. After 1490, he left voluminous manuscripts including studies on proportions. These were later collected and translated into English by Jean Paul Richter and published in 1883. \n\nAvard T. Fairbanks taught in five universities. His proportions study was used for college instruction. The main male and female illustrations (1936) were drawn to accompany Leonardo’s system of relative proportions. He erected more than 100 public monuments over the course of his 75 year career. His son, Eugene F. Fairbanks published books based on this study and his own study of children’s proportions.\n\n\n\n"}

The drink's slogan was \"Everything is going to be OK.\"\n\nIn 1993, Coca-Cola CEO Roberto Goizueta rehired Sergio Zyman to be the chief of marketing for all Coca-Cola beverage brands, a surprising choice given that Zyman had worked closely with the New Coke campaign, possibly the largest advertising failure in Coke's history. However, after revamping the can design and print advertising campaigns for Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Classic with great success, Zyman was given free rein to design new products with aggressive, offbeat marketing campaigns.\n\nInternational market research done by The Coca-Cola Company in the late 1980s revealed that \"Coke\" was the second most recognizable word across all languages in the world. The first word was \"OK\". Zyman (who also conceived Fruitopia) decided to take advantage of this existing brand potential and created a soft drink with this name. He conceived of a counter-intuitive advertising campaign that intentionally targeted people who did not like advertising. He predicted that the soft drink would be a huge success, and promised Goizueta that the soft drink would take at least 4% of the US beverage market. Coca-Cola's special projects manager Brian Lanahan explained to \"Time Magazine\" that they chose the name \"OK\" because \"It underpromises. It doesn't say, 'This is the next great thing.' It's the flip side of overclaiming.” Coca-Cola marketing consultant Tom Pinko told National Public Radio, \"People who are 19 years old are very accustomed to having been manipulated and knowing that they're manipulated,\" and that OK Soda's audience possessed a \"lethargy [that] probably can't be penetrated by any commercial message.\"\n\nDespite a US-wide advertising campaign and intense media attention, OK Soda was marketed only in select areas, representing different demographic areas during the summer of 1993. Four separate can designs were used (with each test market getting all four designs). The Coca-Cola Corporation announced at the time that they would continually update the cans with new designs (later designs can be identified by having an explanatory tag saying that it is \"A unique fruity soda\"). Some of the testing locations were:\n\nOK Soda never captured more than 3% of the beverage market in any of the target locations, failing to match Zyman's hype. The project was cancelled by Coca-Cola just seven months after its kickoff, and the soft drink was never widely released to the public.\n\nOK Soda has been remembered more for its unique advertising campaign than for its fruity flavor. The name and advertising campaign attempted to poke fun at the \"\"I'm OK, You're OK\"\" pop-psychology of the early 1970s. OK Soda was intentionally marketed at the difficult Generation X markets, and attempted to cash in on the group's existing cynicism, disillusionment and disaffection with standard advertising campaigns. OK Soda's concept was that the youth market was already aware that they were being manipulated by mass-media marketing, so this advertising campaign would just be more transparent about it. Its indirect advertising was a form of rebel advertising similar to the McDonald's commercials for the Arch Deluxe. The campaign was designed by Portland, Oregon-based advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy. Spokespeople for the company and their advertisers were very frank about the fact that they were marketing the drink entirely on the \"feeling\" rather than the taste. OK Soda's own advertisements went so far as to dispage the beverage's taste comparing it to things like \"carbonated tree sap.\"\n\nThe general public did not respond to the offbeat campaign, and most critics point out that the campaigning was too overt in its courting of the youth and teen market. \n\nBoth the cans and the print advertisements for the soft drink, created by Wieden+Kennedy creative director Charlotte Moore, conceptual artist Peter Wegner, and designer Todd Waterbury, featured work by popular \"alternative\" cartoonists Daniel Clowes (\"Eightball\", \"Ghost World\") and Charles Burns (\"Black Hole\", \"The BEliever\". Thoguh skeptical of the campaign, Clowes took the job because his work illustrating a couple of cans and a few posters paid more than publishing five books of comics. In an act of subverting OK Soda's already subversive marketing scheme, Clowes gave his OK Soda mascot the facial features of Charles Manson, saying that none of the contracts he signed said, \"Don't put a mass murderer on the can.\"\n\nUnlike the brightly colored Coca-Cola cans, they were decorated in drab shades of gray, with occasional red text. In addition to the primarily two-tone illustrations, the cans featured a special code that could be entered at the toll-free number \"1-800-I-FEEL-OK\" that led callers through a series of true-or-false promps inspired by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Cans also sported a \"Coincidence\" in the form of an odd OK Soda-themed urban legend set in various towns around the United States, each anecdote ending with the statement, \"This is a coincidence.\" OK Soda's marketing team also mailed out these \"Coincidences\" in the form of chain letters to promote the soda, and in turn these chain letter were read on TV spots for OK Soda.\n\nRandomly included with OK Soda selections in vending machines was an OK Soda \"prize can\". Similar to a can of instant soup, the top could be peeled completely off revealing the prize inside. Prizes included some form of OK Soda merchandise rolled to fit (usually a hat) and an additional two quarters to purchase another can of OK Soda. The design of the prize can was different from the others and represented a fifth design overall. It was also more cylindrical in shape, considerably lighter (without soda inside) and included a light-blue banner, the only such design to include this color. This program was similar to Coke's previous MagiCan campaign.\n\nExcerpts from the OK Soda manifesto, written by associate creative director Peter Wegner, were printed on the cans, and were also available for a short while on OK Soda's website. Some of the sayings were:\n\nOK Soda had a more \"citric\" taste than traditional colas, almost like a fruit punch version of Coke's Fresca. It has been described as \"slightly spicy\" and likened to a combination of orange soda and flat Coca-Cola. It has also been compared to what is known as \"suicide\", \"swampwater\" or \"graveyard\", the resulting mixture of multiple soft drink flavors available at a particular convenience store or gas station's soft drink dispenser.\n\nCarbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sucrose, citric acid, caramel color, potassium benzoate (to protect taste), phosphoric acid, acacia, natural flavors, potassium citrate, caffeine, dipotassium phosphate, glycerol ester of wood rosin, brominated vegetable oil, Red 40\n\nAfter its production ceased, OK Soda enjoyed a cult following on the internet, including the use of a newsgroup at alt.fan.ok-soda, which was fairly active for several years. Fans would reminisce about the offbeat advertising materials, sell merchandise and intact cans, and trade recipes for home-brewed OK Soda facsimiles.\n\nWhile OK Soda appears on retrospective lists of failed soft drinks and fluke ad campaigns, Analyst Thomas Flight posits that OK Soda may have been \"ahead of its time\" in its attempts to \"brand disillusionment” through its subversion of traditional marketing. Meanwhile OK Soda's original merchandise, cans and advertising material can still be found readily on eBay with asking prices sometimes in hundreds of U.S. dollars. \n\n\n"}

It was soon discontinued after failing to become popular despite a massive marketing campaign and now is considered one of the most expensive flops of all time.\n\nThe Arch Deluxe was a quarter pound of beef on a split-top potato flour sesame seed bun, topped with a circular piece of peppered bacon, leaf lettuce, tomato, American cheese, onions, ketchup, and a \"secret\" mustard and mayonnaise sauce.\n\nIn response to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald's made a conscious decision to attempt to market its food to a more adult audience. Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided to create a new line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients. It commissioned Executive Chef Andrew Selvaggio to create the Deluxe line of burgers including the Fish Filet Deluxe, Grilled Chicken Deluxe, Crispy Chicken Deluxe, and the flagship Arch Deluxe.\n\nThe Arch Deluxe was first tested as a \"Taste of the Month\" burger in October 1995 at McDonald's restaurants in Canada. Afterwards, the Arch Deluxe was officially released in May 1996 in one of the most expensive advertising campaigns to date. However, customers were dissuaded by the high price and unconventional ads, and consumer groups were upset by the higher caloric content. The brand was still sold at select restaurants during 1998 and 1999. On August 18, 2000, the Arch Deluxe was finally discontinued, and is no longer found at McDonald's stores today.\n\nIt is estimated that McDonald's spent over $300 million on the research, production, and marketing for the Arch Deluxe.

It is also known in Rio Grande do Sul by name negrinho.\n\nIn 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, Brazil was in campaign time for the election of a new president. The candidate Eduardo Gomes, whose military rank was Brigadier (brigadeiro), had enormous success among women, which was evidenced by his slogan of the campaign that was \"Vote for the Brigadier who is handsome and single!\"\n\nTherefore, his most devoted voters decided to try to promote his campaign by organizing parties to raise funds and to give even more visibility to their candidate. Contrary to selling the usual electoral merchandising, they decided to make a candy to be sold in these meetings. There was, however, a problem. As it was in post-war times there was an immense lack of fresh milk and sugar, which complicated the task of making any candy. So they decided to resort to condensed milk, mixing it with butter and chocolate.\n\nIt was created what was then known as \"the candy of the Brigadeiro\" and was sold during the campaign, trying to achieve votes through the palate of the electorate. The candy was a success, but the candidate turned out not to be elected.\n\nDuring the 50's the name was abbreviated and the dessert was spread throughout the country, always with an excellent reception.\n\nThe \"brigadeiro\" makes up a big part of the Brazilian culture and is considered a national icon.\nGenerally made in Brazilian homes, it can be eaten with spoon straight from the pot, which is why it can sometimes be called \"\"brigadeiro\" de colher\" (spoon brigadeiro). It is generally shaped into small balls covered in chocolate sprinkles and placed in a small cupcake mold. This dessert is normally served to children at birthday parties and is eaten after the birthday cake. The \"brigadeiro\" may also be served in different reunions, especially when friends get together. It has a sentimental value to most Brazilians.\n\nThe gourmet \"brigadeiro\" has a touch of sophistication. Over 50 flavors are available in stores called \"brigadeiro\" boutiques. The mixture can vary, but the good-quality ingredients, fresh products, and elegant presentation are key to making gourmet desserts. They can be served in cups, jars, small pots, tubes, spoons , or small boxes that resemble small jewelry boxes. The\" brigadeiro\" has grown and achieved the status of a \"gourmet\" dish.\n\nWith the gourmet \"brigadeiros\", more sophisticated flavors were invented from the original that only needed powdered chocolate.

The production of the candy is currently on hiatus. Necco Wafers were first produced in 1847 and were considered by the company to be its core product.\n\nEach roll of Necco Wafers contains eight flavors: lemon (yellow), lime (green), orange (orange), clove (purple), cinnamon (white), wintergreen (pink), licorice (black), and chocolate (brown). The ingredients in Necco Wafers are sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, gums, colorings, and flavorings.\n\nAs of 2018, the future of Necco Wafers was unclear after the Necco company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Round Hill Investments purchased the company out of bankruptcy for $17.3 million in May 2018, but then abruptly ended operations at Necco on July 24, 2018, citing \"sanitation issues\" it claimed it was previously unaware of. Round Hill has sold off various Necco lines to other candy companies. The Necco Wafer, Sweethearts (the original conversation heart), and Canada Mints, as well as the equipment used to manufacture them, were sold to the Spangler Candy Company of Bryan, Ohio. In September 2018, Spangler announced plans to return the Necco Wafer to the market, with a target date of November 2019.\n\nNecco Wafers date back to 1847. Oliver Chase, an English immigrant, invented a lozenge cutting machine with which he produced the wafers. At the time of the Civil War, these were called \"hub wafers\" and were carried by Union soldiers. In 1901, Chase and Company merged with two other companies to incorporate the New England Confectionery Company. By 1912, the wafers were being advertised as \"Necco Wafers\", a name they still carry today.\n\nDuring World War II the United States government ordered Necco to produce its wafers for soldiers overseas. As a result of this action, Necco saw its sales of the wafers peak. Upon returning home, many former soldiers became faithful customers who continued to buy the wafers.\n\nThe company itself has been acquired several times, first in 1963, and most recently in 2018.\n\nIn 2009, Necco changed the formula for its Necco Wafers. Artificial colors and flavors were eliminated. The candy was made softer through the addition of glycerine. The lime flavor was removed due to difficulties in creating an all-natural green coloring, resulting in a 7-flavor Necco Wafer roll.\n\nAccording to Jackie Hague, Necco's vice president of marketing, switching to all-natural flavors and colors \"would draw young mothers concerned about their children's diet.\" The new cinnamon flavor is \"less like Red Hots\", the new lemon, \"less like paper candy dots and more like lemon meringue pie filling.\" The chocolate flavor—previously a vanilla flavor \"with a hint of chocolate flavoring\"—switches to a more intense all-cocoa flavor. In addition, the Necco Chocolate assortment changed from 100% of the standard Necco chocolate wafers into a four-flavor chocolate assortment. \n\nHowever, the change was not as popular with long-time customers as anticipated.The company received “some complaints about the new formulations.” In response to these concerns, Necco Wafer production switched back to the original formula in the summer of 2011.\n\nTropical Necco Wafers launched in 2012 and offer a new assortment of tropical fruity flavors: mango, passion fruit, coconut, banana, lime, and strawberry\n\nThe Chocolate Necco Wafers is a single-flavor roll composed completely of the Chocolate wafers.\n\nNecco Sour Wafers are in a roll of six tart flavors: Watermelon, Wildberry Grape, Sour Apple, Lemon, Extreme Tangerine, and Blue Raspberry.

Corn tortillas are made of corn, vegetable oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, tortilla chips were always considered to be a Mexican food, known as totopos and tostadas. Though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. Some manufacturers include many other ingredients including wheat, sugar, food colouring, and monosodium glutamate.\n\nThe triangle-shaped tortilla chip was popularized by Rebecca Webb Carranza in the 1940s as a way to make use of misshapen tortillas rejected from the automated tortilla manufacturing machine that she and her husband used at their Mexican delicatessen and tortilla factory in southwest Los Angeles. Carranza found that the discarded tortillas, cut into triangles and fried, were a popular snack, and she sold them for a dime a bag at the El Zarape Tortilla Factory. In 1994, Carranza received the Golden Tortilla award for her contribution to the Mexican food industry.\n\nTortilla chips are the quintessential and often complimentary appetizer in Tex-Mex and Mexican restaurants in the U.S. and elsewhere. Their popularity outside of California saw a steady rise in the late 1970s when they began to compete with corn chips, the dipping chip of choice during the first three quarters of the 20th century. They are typically served with a dip, such as salsa, chile con queso, or guacamole. When not served with a dip, the chips are often seasoned with herbs and spices. Although they are now available worldwide, the United States is one of the main markets for tortilla chips. Commercial brand names for tortilla chips include Phileas Fogg snacks, Tostitos, Doritos, and Don Tacos (in Japan).\n\nA more elaborate dish utilizing tortilla chips is nachos. First created circa 1943 by Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya, nachos are tortilla chips served with melted or shredded cheese, although often other toppings are added or substituted, such as meat, salsa (such as pico de gallo), refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, diced onions, olives, and pickled jalapeños. More elaborate nachos are often baked for a short period of time to warm the tortillas and melt shredded cheese.\n\nA similar fried corn snack is the corn chip, which is not made from a tortilla, but from corn meal which has been processed into a particular shape, typically a small scoop. Fritos are an example of this. The principal difference between the corn in tortilla and corn chips is that the corn in a tortilla chip has undergone a process known as nixtamalization, which involves processing the raw corn with quicklime. Both tortilla and corn chips are referred to as \"corn chips\" in Australia and Oceania.\n\n"}

Often in the West the community belongs to a religious order, and the life of the cenobitic monk is regulated by a religious rule, a collection of precepts. The older style of monasticism, to live as a hermit, is called eremitic. A third form of monasticism, found primarily in Eastern Christianity, is the skete.\n\nThe English words \"cenobite\" and \"cenobitic\" are derived, via Latin, from the Greek words \"koinos\" (κοινός), \"common\", and \"bios\" (βίος), \"life\". The adjective can also be cenobiac (κοινοβιακός, \"koinobiakos\"). A group of monks living in community is often referred to as a cenobium.\n\nCenobitic monasticism exists in various religions, although Buddhist and Christian cenobitic monasticism are the most prominent.\n\nThe word \"Cenobites\" was initially applied to the followers of Pythagoras in Crotona, Italy, who founded a commune not just for philosophical study but also for the \"amicable sharing of worldly goods.\"\n\nIn the 1st century AD, Philo of Alexandria (c. 25 BC – c. 50 AD) describes a Jewish ascetic community of men and women on the shores of Lake Mareotis in the vicinity of Alexandria, Egypt which he calls the Therapeutae. Members of the community lived apart from one another during the six days of the week, studying the Hebrew Bible during the daytime and eating during the evening, whereafter they hoped to dream visions informed by their studies. Members of the community composed books of midrash, an allegorical method for interpreting scripture. Only on the sabbath would the Therapeutae meet, share their learning, eat a common, albeit simple, meal of bread and spring water, and listen to a lecture on the Torah given by one of the venerable members of the community. Every seventh sabbath was accorded a festival of learning and singing, which climaxed in an egalitarian dance. \n\nThe 3rd-century Christian writer Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263–339), in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", identified Philo's Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, and solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks.\n\nThe organized version of Christian cenobitic monasticism is commonly thought to have started in Egypt in the 4th century AD. Christian monks of previous centuries were usually hermits, especially in the Middle East; this continued to be very common until the decline of Aramean Christianity in the Late Middle Ages. This form of solitary living, however, did not suit everyone. Some monks found the eremitic style to be too lonely and difficult; and if one was not spiritually prepared, the life could lead to mental breakdowns.\n\nFor this reason, organized monastic communities were established so that monks could have more support in their spiritual struggle. While eremitic monks did have an element of socializing, since they would meet once a week to pray together, cenobitic monks came together for common prayer on a more regular basis. The cenobitic monks also practised more socializing because the monasteries where they lived were often located in or near inhabited villages. For example, the Bohairic version of Dionysius Exiguus' \"The Life of Saint Pachomius\" states that the monks of the monastery of Tabenna built a church for the villagers of the nearby town of the same name even \"before they constructed one for themselves.\" This means that cenobitic monks did find themselves in contact with other people, including lay people, whereas the eremitic monks tried their best to keep to themselves, only meeting for prayer occasionally.\n\nCenobitic monks were also different from their eremitic predecessors and counterparts in their actual living arrangements. Whereas the eremitic monks (\"hermits\") lived alone in a monastery consisting of merely a hut or cave (\"cell\"), the cenobitic monks (\"cenobites\") lived together in monasteries comprising one or a complex of several buildings. In the latter case, each dwelling would house about twenty monks, and within the house there were separate rooms or cells that would be inhabited by two or three monks. This structure of living for the cenobitic monks has been attributed to the same man that is usually hailed as the \"father of cenobitic monasticism,\" St. Pachomius. Pachomius is thought to have got the idea for living quarters like these from the time he spent in the Roman army, as the style is very \"reminiscent of army barracks.\"\n\nThough Pachomius is often credited as the \"father of cenobitic monasticism,\" it is more accurate to think of him as the \"father of \"organized\" cenobitic monasticism\", as he was the first monk to take smaller communal groups that often already existed and bring them together into a larger federation of monasteries.\n\nThe account of how Pachomius was given the idea to start a cenobitic monastery is found in Palladius of Galatia's \"\"The Lausiac History\"\", which says that an angel conveyed the idea to him. Though this is an interesting explanation of why he decided to initiate the cenobitic tradition, there are sources that indicate there were already \"other\" communal monastic communities around at that time and possibly before him. In fact, three of the nine monasteries that joined Pachomius' cenobitic federation were not founded by him, meaning he actually was not the first to have such an idea since these three \"clearly had an independent origin.\"\n\nThough he was not the first to implement communal monasticism, Pachomius is still an important part of cenobitic monastic history, since he was the first to bring separate monasteries together into a more organized structure. This is the reason why (as well as the fact that much hagiography and literature has been written about him) he has continued to be recognized as the father of the tradition.\n\nAside from the monasteries that joined Pachomius' federation of cenobitic monasteries, there were also other cenobitic groups, both Christian and non-Christian, who decided not to join him. The Melitians and the Manichaeans are examples of these cenobitic groups.\n\nEven before Pachomius had started on his path toward monastic communities, the Melitians as a group were already recruiting members. The Melitians were a heretical Christian sect founded by Meletius of Lycopolis Moreover, they had \"heard of Pachomius' monastic aspirations and tried to recruit him\" to join their community.\n\nAs for Manichaeans, members of a religion founded by a man named Mani, some scholars believe they were the \"pioneers of communal asceticism in Egypt,\" and not Pachomius and the Pachomians as has become the common thought. Mani, himself, was actually influenced to begin cenobitic monasticism from other groups, including Buddhists and Jewish-Christian Elkasites who were practising this tradition already.\n\nThe overall idea of cenobitic monasticism cannot be traced to a single source, however, but rather developed from the ideas and work of numerous groups, including the aforementioned Melitians, Manichaeans, Elkasites, Buddhists and Pachomians.\n\nThe cenobitic monastic idea did not end with these early groups, though, but rather inspired future groups and individuals:\n\n\nIn both the East and the West, cenobiticism established itself as the primary form of monasticism, with many foundations being richly endowed by rulers and nobles. The excessive acquisition of wealth and property led to several attempts at reform, such as Bernard of Clairvaux in the West and Nilus of Sora in the East.\n\n\n"}

The word \"Fallschirmjäger\" is from the German \"Fallschirm\", \"parachute\", and \"Jäger\", literally 'hunter,' which refers in this context to light infantry.\n\nIn the 1930s Hermann Göring, after having observed Soviet airborne infantry maneuvers, became committed to the creation of Germany's airborne infantry. He ordered the formation of a specialist police unit in 1933, devoted to protecting Nazi party officials. The unit carried out conventional police duties for the next two years, but in 1935, Göring transformed it into Germany's first dedicated airborne regiment. The unit was incorporated into the newly formed \"Luftwaffe\" later that year and training commenced. Göring also ordered that a group of volunteers be drawn for parachute training. These volunteers would form a cadre for a future \"Fallschirmtruppe\" (\"parachute troops\"). In January 1936, 600 men and officers formed a \"Jäger\" and an engineer company. Germany's parachute arm was officially inaugurated in 1936 with a call for recruits for a parachute training school. The school was open to \"Luftwaffe\" personnel, who were required to successfully complete six jumps in order to receive the \"Luftwaffe\" parachutist's badge.\n\nDuring World War II, the German Air Force (\"Luftwaffe\") raised a variety of airborne light infantry (\"Fallschirmjäger\") units. The \"Luftwaffe\" built up a division-sized unit of three \"Fallschirmjäger\" regiments plus supporting arms and air assets, known as the 7th \"Flieger\" Division. Throughout World War II, the \"Fallschirmjäger\" overall commander was Kurt Student.\n\n\"Fallschirmjäger\" participated in the occupation of Norway and Denmark and in the battles of Belgium, the Netherlands and France in 1940. They also took part in the Balkans Campaign, Battle of Crete, Italian Campaign, and on both the Eastern Front and later the Western Front would follow.\n\nIn the modern German \"Bundeswehr\", \"Fallschirmjäger\" continue to form the core of special operations units. The division has two brigade equivalents and several independent companies and battalions. All told, about 10,000 troops served in that division in 2010, most of them support or logistics personnel. The division has the following structure:\n\n\nThe vast majority of division members are deployable by parachute, and all of it is at least air mobile. Almost all vehicles and heavy equipment are transportable by helicopter, including special lightly armoured Wiesel \"heavy weapon transport vehicles\" adopted for this purpose. In addition to the Special Operations Division, Germany is also setting up an air mobile or air assault regiment.\n\nformer troops\n\n40. Fallschirmjägerbataillon Willi Sänger was the only airborne infantry formation of the \"Nationale Volksarmee\" (NVA). The battalion and its airborne-commando school were based in Prora on Rügen (1961–82) and near Potsdam (1982–90). Officially, the battalion was an airborne unit organized as an NVA light infantry battalion, but in reality it was considered a commando unit. On mission, the companies of the battalion were to be split up into teams of five or six men. As a force with special capabilities, it remained under the direct command of the army high command (\"Kommando Landstreitkräfte\", KdoLaSK).\n\nThe reconnaissance company of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (German:\" Wachregiment \"Feliks E. Dzierzynski\"\"), an elite motorized rifle regiment of the Ministry for State Security of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was a parachute-trained unit.\n\nBell, Kelly. \"Costly Capture Of Crete.\" World War II 14.1 (1999): 50.

{"id": "941491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=941491", "title": "Seventh-inning stretch", "text": "Seventh-inning stretch\n\nIn baseball in the United States and Canada, the seventh-inning stretch is a tradition that takes place between the halves of the seventh inning of a game – in the middle of the seventh inning. Fans generally stand up and stretch out their arms and legs and sometimes walk around. It is a popular time to get a late-game snack or an alcoholic beverage as well, as vendors end alcohol sales after the last out of the seventh inning. The stretch also serves as a short break for the players. Most ballparks in professional baseball mark this point of the game by playing the crowd sing-along song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". Since the September 11 attacks, many American ballparks complement or replace the song with the playing of \"God Bless America.\" If a game goes into a fifth extra inning, a similar \"fourteenth-inning stretch\" is celebrated (as well as a possible \"twenty-first inning stretch\" or \"twenty-eighth inning stretch\"). In softball games, amateur games scheduled for only seven innings, or in minor-league doubleheaders, a \"fifth-inning stretch\" may be substituted.\n\nThe origin of the seventh-inning stretch is much disputed, and it is difficult to certify any definite history.\n\nOne claimant is Brother Jasper (Brennan) of Mary, F.S.C., the man credited with bringing baseball to Manhattan College in New York City. Being the Prefect of Discipline as well as the coach of the team, it fell to Brother Jasper to supervise the student fans at every home game. On one particularly hot and muggy day in June 1882, during the seventh inning against a semi-pro team called the Metropolitans, the Prefect noticed his charges becoming restless. To break the tension, he called a timeout in the game and instructed everyone in the bleachers to stand up and unwind. It worked so well he began calling for a seventh-inning rest period at every game. The Manhattan College custom spread to the major leagues after the New York Giants were charmed by it at an exhibition game.\n\nIn June 1869 the \"New York Herald\" published a report on a game between the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Brooklyn Eagles (home team): \"At the close of the long second inning, the laughable stand up and stretch was indulged in all round the field.\"\n\nWhether a stretch was observed nationwide is not known, but later in 1869 the \"Cincinnati Commercial\" reported on a game that was played on the West Coast between the Red Stockings and the Eagle Club of San Francisco: \"One thing noticeable in this game was a ten minutes' intermission at the end of the sixth inning – a dodge to advertise and have the crowd patronize the bar.\"\n\nHowever, a letter written in 1869 by Harry Wright (1835–1895), manager of the Cincinnati Red Stockings documented something very similar to a seventh-inning stretch, making the following observation about the Cincinnati fans' ballpark behavior: \"The spectators all arise between halves of the seventh inning, extend their legs and arms and sometimes walk about. In so doing they enjoy the relief afforded by relaxation from a long posture upon hard benches.\" Another tale holds that the stretch was invented by a manager stalling for time to warm up a relief pitcher.\n\nOn October 18, 1889 Game 1 of the 1889 World Series saw a seventh-inning stretch after somebody yelled \"stretch for luck\".\n\nA popular story for the origin of the seventh-inning stretch is that on April 14, 1910, on opening day, , , President William Howard Taft was sore from prolonged sitting at a game between the Washington Senators and the Philadelphia Athletics and stood up to stretch, causing the crowd to feel obligated to join their president in his gestures. This story is set at a far later date than the others, however, so he may only have given the presidential seal of approval to a longstanding tradition; the story that his physical problems forced him to stand up contradict this, but he might have just been waiting for the proper accepted time to relieve his pain; either way, he gave national publicity to the practice.\n\nAs to the name, there appears to be no written record of the name \"seventh-inning stretch\" before 1920, which since at least the late 1870s was called the Lucky Seventh, indicating that the 7th inning was settled on for superstitious reasons.\n\nIn modern baseball, standing up and singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch is a popular tradition. It was first played at a ballpark at a high school in Los Angeles, California in 1934. The lyrics for the 1908 Tin Pan Alley standard were written by vaudeville star Jack Norworth (1879–1959), who had ironically never attended an actual baseball game prior to writing the song, and only attended his first Major League game in 1940.\n\nThere is no certain date when the tradition began, but the practice gained exceptional notoriety from broadcaster Harry Caray. Caray would sing the song to himself in the broadcast booth during the stretch while a play-by-play announcer for the Chicago White Sox. After hearing him sing one day, White Sox owner Bill Veeck Jr., the famed baseball promoter, had Caray's microphone turned on so that the ballpark could hear him sing. When Caray moved into the Chicago Cubs broadcast booth, he continued the practice, sparking what has become a Cubs tradition by regularly leading the crowd in singing the song in every seventh-inning stretch. Since his death, the Cubs have invited various celebrities to lead the crowd during the stretch, including James Belushi, John Cusack, Mike Ditka, Michael J. Fox, Bill Murray, Dan Patrick, Ozzy Osbourne, Eddie Vedder, Mr. T and Billy Corgan.\n\nMany teams will also play a local traditional song either before or after \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\". Since the 1970s, the Baltimore Orioles have often played the raucous John Denver song \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" at the conclusion of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". During the bridge of the song, in which Denver holds a long note, fans yell \"Ooooooooh!\" (since the name \"Orioles\" is often shortened to \"O's\".) The Atlanta Braves also play this song after \"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\".\n\nJane Jarvis, the organist at the New York Mets' home Shea Stadium from 1964 to 1979, played the \"Mexican Hat Dance\" during the stretch. After the Mets switched to recorded music, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" became standard. In recent decades, the Lou Monte tune \"Lazy Mary\" has followed it, continuing to play it at Citi Field. 2018 will be the final year the song will be played at Citi Field during the seventh inning stretch and will be replaced with Piano Man by Billy Joel.\n\nWhen the St. Louis Cardinals were owned by Anheuser-Busch, Busch Memorial Stadium organist Ernie Hays played \"Here Comes the King\", a commonly recognized jingle for Budweiser beer, during the stretch. On Opening Day, during playoff games and on \"big nights\" such as games against the Chicago Cubs, a team of Budweiser's mascot Clydesdale horses would also make a circuit of the warning track. Since Anheuser-Busch's sale of the Cardinals in 1996, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" has been played in the middle of 7th inning, with \"Here Comes The King\" at the top of the 8th. Often, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" is followed by an instrumental rendition of \"Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis\". The Clydesdales still appear on Opening Day and during the playoffs.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays take the term \"seventh-inning \"stretch\"\" literally, as Health Canada officials lead fans at Rogers Centre in stretching exercises while the club's song \"OK Blue Jays\" plays before \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".\n\nThe Miami Marlins, attempting to mimic the Blue Jays' exercising song in their inaugural year of 1993, created a group of dancers, some former University of Miami Sunsations or Miami Heat dancers, and called the group \"The Seventh Inning Stretchers\". At the first game this group came onto the field at the top of the 7th inning, and the crowd was encouraged to stand and stretch, and do a choreographed dance to Gloria Estefan's song \"Get on Your Feet\". The crowd, thinking it was the actual 7th inning stretch, booed loudly. The group appeared at the 2nd game the following evening, but was booed again and was never seen following that game.\n\nAfter the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 1998 home opener, they played the popular Jimmy Buffett song \"Fins\" after the 6th inning, rather than the 7th inning stretch. The grounds crew sent on the field after the 6th inning wore tropical clothing, and everyone in the park formed their arms into fins for the \"Fins to the left, fins to the right\" portions of the song. This tradition was dropped several years later.\n\nThe Texas Rangers initially played only \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\" during the 7th inning stretch. When the team moved to their new facility in 1994, The Ballpark in Arlington (now The Globe Life Park in Arlington), \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" was added to 7th inning stretch, followed by \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\". Somewhat unusual for a 7th inning stretch song, the version of \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\" played is an instrumental, by Al Dean from the album \"Plays For Urban Cowboys\". Rather than singing along, the crowd claps along and stomps their feet to the tune.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins play \"Little Red Corvette\" by Prince, due to the tradition that rookies and newly traded players know the lyrics to the song.\n\nOther clubs that traditionally play songs after \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" include: Cincinnati Reds (\"Cincinnati Ohio\" – Connie Smith), Milwaukee Brewers (\"The Beer Barrel Polka\" – in reference to the city's beermaking heritage), Houston Astros (\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\"), Los Angeles Angels (\"Build Me Up Buttercup\"), Seattle Mariners (\"Louie Louie\" by The Kingsmen), the Colorado Rockies (a cover version of \"Hey! Baby\"), and the Washington Nationals (\"Take on Me\" by A-ha, a song that became popular with Nationals fans during the 2012 season when Michael Morse used it as his walk-up music).\n\nWhile all thirty Major League franchises currently sing the traditional \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" in the seventh inning, several other teams will sing their local favorite between the top and bottom of the eighth inning. Boston Red Sox fans at Fenway Park, for example, sing along to Neil Diamond's recording of \"Sweet Caroline\". A notable occurrence happened in June 2011 when during the playing of the song, the city's NHL franchise, the Boston Bruins, captured the Stanley Cup following a 7-game series against the Vancouver Canucks, and many fans cheered after the announcement was made. Following the Boston Marathon bombing, several teams (including Boston's archrival, the New York Yankees) temporarily played \"Sweet Caroline\" in the middle of the eighth inning as well, or at other times during the game, as a means of showing solidarity with the City of Boston. The New York Mets have previously used \"Sweet Caroline\" but have since dropped it. After experimenting with it during select games during the 2014 season, the Mets began to implement Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" as a full-time sing along. Similarly, starting in 2008, the Kansas City Royals began to play \"Friends in Low Places\" by celebrity supporter and one-time spring training invitee Garth Brooks during the middle of the 8th.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers also hold an 8th inning tradition, with fans singing Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\". The practice came under controversy when the song's author, Steve Perry, a Bay Area native and San Francisco Giants fan, asked the Dodgers to stop the tradition. The team refused and continue to play the song through the 2013 season. The Minnesota Twins, who played the same song, ended the tradition upon moving to Target Field in 2010.\n\nThe Journey song \"Lights\" is frequently played at San Francisco Giants baseball games (including a version led by Perry himself in the middle of the 8th inning during Game 2 of the 2010 World Series) and the cross-bay Oakland Athletics after-game fireworks starts.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers also play the beginning of \"Don't Stop Believin'\" in the eighth inning, showing the lyrics on the big screen. Fan will sing along, especially the line, \"born and raised in South Detroit\". Of course, there is no area called South Detroit by Detroiters, as Downtown Detroit is considered geographically south (and, therefore, South Detroit would actually be in Windsor, Ontario, Canada).\n\nThe Washington Nationals play A-ha's \"Take on Me\" during the middle of the eighth inning.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics play Bay Area native MC Hammer's \"2 Legit 2 Quit\" during the middle of the eighth.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians play \"Hang on Sloopy\" in honor of Ohio State University during the middle of the 8th, and fans spell out O-H-I-O at the appropriate times within the song.\n\nThe San Diego Padres play \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" during the middle of the 8th.\n\nThe New York Yankees play \"Cotton Eyed Joe\" in the 8th inning.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, \"God Bless America\" became common during the seventh-inning stretch, sometimes in addition to \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" and sometimes replacing it entirely. Some stadiums play \"God Bless America\" only on Sundays. At Yankee Stadium the song is now played at every game, in addition to \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".\n\nSince 2002, \"God Bless America\" has been performed at all Major League Baseball All-Star Games and playoff games in the United States, often with a celebrity recording artist or a member of the United States Armed Forces (\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" is sometimes done afterwards with a recording of Harry Caray), as well as Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and September 11.\n\nDuring the deciding Game 5 of the 2011 National League Division Series, Lauren Hart (daughter of Hockey Hall of Fame broadcaster Gene Hart) appeared at Citizens Bank Park to sing \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch; before this she had become a fixture at NHL Philadelphia Flyers games singing that song in duet with Kate Smith (the artist best known for the song) as the Flyers' good-luck charm before important games, and it was hoped that she would bring luck to the Philadelphia Phillies as well.\n\nBetween the top and bottom of the 6th inning, the New York Yankees play \"Y.M.C.A.\" by Village People while the grounds crew come out and clean the infield. In the chorus, the grounds crew drop their tools and do the \"YMCA\" dance with their arms. The middle of the 6th inning at Milwaukee Brewers games is time for the Sausage Race, when people running in costumes for the bratwurst, Polish sausage, Italian sausage, hot dog and chorizo get up to 45,000 fans on their feet as they race around the clay dirt near the dugouts of Miller Park. Other teams hold similar races. The Pittsburgh Pirates hold the \"Great Pittsburgh Pierogi Race N'At\" (also called the Great Pierogi Race) during the sixth inning at home games, where people dressed as cartoon cheese, saurkraut, jalapeno, potato, onion, and bacon pierogies run around the warning track at PNC Park. This race is often combined with visiting mascots such as the Brewers' sausages or the Nationals' presidents.\n\n\n"}

They are used as a form of incentive payment for the cartoon characters Scooby-Doo and Shaggy from the Hanna-Barbera series \"Scooby-Doo\" and its various spin-offs.\n\nProducer William Hanna had always imagined that a \"Scooby Snack\" would taste like some sort of a caramel-flavored cookie. He and Joseph Barbera had previously used the concept of a dog, Snuffles, that goes wild for doggie treats in the Quick Draw McGraw series in 1959. Likewise Hanna-Barbera created dog character Muttley, the year before Scooby Doo, who is similarly rewarded by cohort Dick Dastardly with a Medal for reward or valor.\n\nIn \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", a treat known as Mellow Mutt Munchie was offered as an alternative to the Scooby Snack. They appeared in the episode \"The Return of Commander Cool\" (1989), where an amnesiac Shaggy believed himself to be his favorite superhero Commander Cool and Scooby to be Mellow Mutt and, as a consequence, wouldn't allow Scooby to eat a Scooby Snack. Scooby reacted to the Mellow Mutt Munchie the same way he does with the Scooby Snacks. In another episode, \"Wrestle Maniacs\" (1990), despite no longer being amnesiac, Shaggy tried to offer a Mellow Mutt Munchie instead of the traditional Scooby Snack but his Mellow Mutt Munchie box was empty so Daphne offered a Scooby Snack anyway. (Scooby Snacks were also prominent in \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\".)\n\nIn \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\" (2009), it is revealed that Shaggy made up the recipe which includes eggs, water, flour, cocoa, sugar, and dog kibble for texture.\n\nIn \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\" (2016), it is shown that the recipe for Scooby Snacks comes from Sorcerer Snacks who were renamed for Scooby-Doo after the gang solves the mystery of who was trying to sabotage their production.\n\nScooby Snacks seem to come in many different flavours (although all boxes are identical), and in one of the later episodes, \"Recipe for Disaster\" (2004), Scooby and Shaggy are ecstatic when Shaggy wins a tour of the Scooby Snacks factory where they attempt to sample the batter pre-cooking before being shooed off by an irate worker who thinks they are trying to steal the recipe.\n\nWarner Bros. licensed \"Scooby Snacks\" as both an official brand of doggie treats and as a human-consumable cookie snack. Vanilla wafers, similar to Nilla Wafers were packaged and sold as \"Scooby Snacks\" in Suncoast home video stores. They are also sold in store image houses.\n\nThe official brand of dog treats is made by Snausages, a product of Del Monte Foods.\n\nKeebler has introduced a line of baked graham cracker sticks shaped like Scooby Snacks. They come in cinnamon and honey flavor.\n"}

An English translation is thus \"share company\", or company limited by shares, or joint-stock company. In German the use of the term \"Aktien\" for shares is restricted to \"Aktiengesellschaften\". Shares in other types of German companies (e.g. GmbH) are called \"Anteile\" rather than \"Aktien\".\n\nIn Germany and Austria, the legal basis of the AG is the German Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG) (\"shares law\") or the Austrian Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG). Since the German commercial law (§ 19 Handelsgesetzbuch) requires all corporations to specify their legal form in their name, in order to inform the public of the limits on their liability, all German (required by § 4 Aktiengesetz) and Austrian stock corporations include \"Aktiengesellschaft\" or \"AG\" as part of their name, frequently as a suffix.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Company Limited by Shares (or \"Aktiengesellschaft\" in German, \"société anonyme\" in French, \"società anonima\" in Italian, \"societad anonima\" in Romansh) is defined in Title Twenty-Six of the Code of Obligations. Article 950 specifies that the business name must indicate the legal form.\n\nGerman AGs have a \"two-tiered board\" structure, consisting of a supervisory board (\"Aufsichtsrat\") and a management board (\"Vorstand\"). The supervisory board is generally controlled by shareholders, although employees may have seats, depending on the size of the company. The management board directly runs the company, but its members may be removed by the supervisory board, which also determines the management board's compensation. Some German AGs have management boards which determine their own remuneration, but that situation is now relatively uncommon.\n\nThe general meeting is the supreme governing body of a Swiss company limited by shares. It elects the board of directors (\"Verwaltungsrat\" in German) and the external auditors. The board of directors may appoint and dismiss persons entrusted with managing and representing the company.\n\nThe equivalent terms in other countries include the following, which mostly mean literally either \"share company/society\" or \"anonymous company/society\".\n\n\n"}

Even if there are many variations, two principal types are made: a cured dry sausage typical of Basilicata, Apulia, and Calabria, and a very different uncured salame, made in Tuscany and Liguria. \nIt is part of southern Italian cultural heritage, much more than in the north, that locals (especially in the smaller rural towns) will still slaughter the pig themselves and make their own soppressata, along with other cured meats as a tradition: nothing goes to waste. Soppressata is sometimes prepared using ham.\n\n\"Soppressata di Basilicata\" is mainly produced in Rivello, Cancellara, Vaglio, and Lagonegro. \n\"Soppressata di Calabria\" enjoys Protected designation of origin status; the one produced in Acri and Decollatura is especially renowned.\n\"Soppressata di Puglia\" from Martina Franca is also very well-known. \n\n\"Soppressata Toscana\", soppressata from Tuscany, is made from the leftover parts of the pig. First, the head is boiled for a few hours. When it is done, it is picked of meat and skin. All of the meat and skin, including the tongue, are chopped, seasoned, and then stuffed into a large casing. The cooking liquid is poured in to cover the mixture and it is then hung and the cooking liquid (high in gelatin) thickens to bind everything together. It is similar to the English brawn and the German \"Presskopf\" (Austrian \"Presswurst\").\n\n\"Sopressa Veneta\" got its name from the practice of pressing the salami between planks of wood resulting in a straight, flattened shape. The northern Italian version from Vicenza, in the Veneto region, did away with the pressed shape and has become an international favorite.\n"}

They are usually round, and normally range from about across; though gobstoppers can be up to in diameter.\n\nThe term \"gobstopper\" derives from 'gob', which is slang in the United Kingdom and Ireland for mouth. The sweet was a favourite amongst British schoolboys between World War I and World War II. In his 1964 children's book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", British author Roald Dahl described \"Everlasting Gobstoppers\", a fictional type of gobstopper that could never get smaller or be finished.\n\nGobstoppers usually consist of a number of layers, each layer dissolving to reveal a differently coloured (and sometimes differently flavoured) layer, before dissolving completely. Gobstoppers are too hard to bite without risking dental damage (hence the name \"jawbreaker\").\n\nGobstoppers have been sold in traditional sweet shops for at least a century, often sold by weight from jars. As gobstoppers dissolve very slowly, they last a very long time in the mouth, which is a major factor in their enduring popularity with children. Larger ones can take days or even weeks to fully dissolve.\n\nGobstoppers are made by slowly depositing layers onto a core (such as a pressed ball of sugar or a gumball). Gobstoppers are made in large, rotating, heated pans. This is called \"hot panning\". The candies take several weeks to manufacture, as the process of adding liquid sugar is repeated multiple times. Natural and artificial colours and flavours are also added during the panning process.\n\nThe Everlasting Gobstoppers, sold under Nestlé's Willy Wonka Candy Company brand, were first introduced in 1976 by Breaker Confections, and are named after the Everlasting Gobstoppers in Roald Dahl's children's book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". In Dahl's story, Everlasting Gobstoppers are purported to last forever. Dahl named the sweet after Gobstoppers, which were a favourite among British schoolboys between the two World Wars.\n\nIn 2003, Taquandra Diggs, a nine-year-old girl in Starke, Florida, suffered severe burns, allegedly from biting on a Wonka Everlasting Gobstopper that had been left out in the sun. Diggs and several other alleged victims' families filed lawsuits against Nestlé for medical bills resulting from plastic surgery as well as pain and suffering; the matters were later settled outside of court for an undisclosed amount.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "950999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=950999", "title": "Street hockey", "text": "Street hockey\n\nStreet hockey (also known as dek hockey, ball hockey, road hockey) is a variation of the sport of ice hockey where the game is played outdoors on foot, or with inline or roller skates using a ball or puck. Both ball and puck are typically designed to be played on non-ice surfaces. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting the ball or puck into the opposing team's net. Street hockey in pickup form is generally played under the following guidelines since there are no \"official rules\" for local pickup hockey:\n\n\nIn its most pure form, street hockey is always played on an outdoor surface (very often a street, parking lot, tennis court or other asphalt surface), which the genesis of the name street hockey. Teams can be selected by various methods but usually are selected by captains via alternate selection of available players. Alternatively, all the players put their sticks in a pile and the sticks are tossed out of the pile to opposing sides. In more organized forms, it is played in rinks which often were designed for roller hockey and can be indoor or outdoor rinks. There are also rinks built specifically for hockey played on foot, and they are referred to as dek hockey or ball hockey rinks. Such rinks can also be used for roller hockey games.\n\nRoad hockey is believed to have begun when roads started getting paved in wealthier parts of North America, around the turn of the 20th century. The term \"street hockey\" was thus started in Canada at some similar time, but a search of records on the internet and in several libraries by fans of hockey, in general, has not turned up an exact year. The sport and thus the term street hockey eventually spread south to the United States. Most people who play the sport generally agree that no single person or entity invented the term \"street hockey\" but that it simply invented itself, just like the term \"ice hockey,\" since it describes a form of hockey. People would literally play the game out in the street so they had to ask people to play by asking them if wanted to play hockey out in the street.\n\nAs children and teenagers, almost all ice hockey players work on their skills and practice their games by playing street hockey, often alone in driveways or out in the street in front of their houses. Throughout the history of organized hockey, many professional ice players participate in various promotional street hockey games and charity events, often appearing as part of the respective National Hockey League team's youth street hockey programs. Since not every ice hockey player can be on the ice at all times, the vast majority play some form of street hockey either for pure enjoyment, to better their overall hockey skills, or both.\n\nAlso, since the cost of smaller-sized home ice rinks was too expensive for professional players, many would often play street hockey throughout the summer months to keep in shape physically. That also offered them a chance to work on various different aspects of the game in a cost-effective manner. Before the era of big salaries, many semi-professional and professional players would play in pickup games with each other when they lived within driving distance of each other.\n\nIt was only in the early 1970s, when Raymond W. Leclerc, the founder of the Mylec Corporation and the creator of the \"No Bounce\" orange ball, along with several prominent players in the Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada, established rules for the more organized forms of the game. These rule were quickly adopted by most leagues in the area and then eventually spread throughout the US and Canada by a printed rulebook, which people could purchase. LeClerc is informally recognized as the \"Father of Street Hockey.\"\n\nAfter a few years of experimenting with all the dynamics, Leclerc built a model site in 1974 to play and advance the game in Leominster, Massachusetts. The site, Leominster DekHockey Centre, has 3 outdoor rinks all with modular sport court surfaces and is informally known as the \"Home of DekHockey.\" The organized version of street hockey with teams competing in leagues caught on with a large number of players in Toronto, Montreal, Ontario, New York, Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Various leagues and tournaments soon were springing up throughout those regions. The game then spread South and West as the Northeast US players relocated to different areas of the United States and Canadian players moved outside of the Ontario and Quebec provinces.\n\nIn Canada, the sport was organized for tournament play on a provincial and national level in the late 1970s, with the founding of the Canadian Ball Hockey Association. More formal organization of the sport quickly followed, which led to provincial tournaments and eventually the Canadian National Championships.\n\nStreet hockey is based on ice hockey, and the overall purpose is the same: to score more goals than your opponent by shooting the ball or puck into the opposing team's net using your stick. It is typically played on foot on some outdoor asphalt, cement or modular sport surface. The most popular balls of choice are orange \"no bounce\" plastic balls that are specifically made for street hockey, as well as tennis balls. Pucks are rarely used due to the playing surface, but, in some instances, a special puck designed with bearings for roller hockey can also be used. If a puck is used, generally the players agree for safety purposes to make every effort to keep the puck on the ground since the players generally don't wear protective head gear and if a puck were to strike a player in the head it could cause serious medical injury and damage. Generally, street hockey is played with little to no protective equipment, therefore intense physical contact is usually prohibited, and levels of physical contact are agreed upon before hand by the participants. The game does permit a level of physical contact similar to that allowed in basketball.\n\nRules and playing styles can differ from area to area depending upon the traditions a certain group has set aside. In informal play, the game often begins one of two ways: 1) a so-called \"NHL face-off\", in which the two opposing centers hit their sticks against each other three times saying \"N\", \"H\", \"L\". Immediately following the \"L\" the two players fight to see who claims possession of the ball or puck 2) One team simply takes the ball or puck out from behind their own goalie net, similar to how a basketball game resumes when one team scores a basket.\n\nWhen street hockey is played in rinks, whether outdoor or indoor, it is often called \"dek hockey\" or \"ball hockey\" depending on where in the U.S. and Canada it is being played. An overwhelming majority refer to it as ball hockey, with some parts of America preferring \"dek hockey\". For clarification purposes, dek and ball hockey are played under organized rules if they are not already being played as part of an organized league which has an official set of rules (see the section Leagues and governing bodies below). In other words, if you say you are playing dek hockey or ball hockey, both have specific meanings as to the type of rules you are playing under, but you are nonetheless playing under rules.\n\nStreet hockey can also be played on indoor basketball courts and/or gymnasiums. This type of game is called floor hockey and in organized leagues often has specific rules in place that differ slightly from outdoor street hockey. The walls or fencing of these \"rinks\" serve to keep the ball (or the less often used puck) in play similarly to the boards of an ice rink. Floor hockey has several variations, two of which resemble street hockey. These two variations are called cosom hockey (named for Cosom, a major supplier of physical education class equipment) and floorball. It must be noted however that cosom hockey, and floorball are considered formal subsets of street hockey since they have such different rules.\n\nSome regions in North America use \"street hockey\" in reference to roller hockey, where inline or roller skates are worn to play otherwise the same game. Street hockey is generally played on foot, and when players use inline or roller skates to play, the sport becomes roller hockey or inline hockey. All this terminology can seem confusing to non-players and the general public, but ultimately is a simple case of semantics. General consensus among players of the sport is as follows:\n\nStreet Hockey has variations called dek hockey, ball hockey, and roller hockey. Dek hockey got its name from the material of the floor which it is played on. When street hockey leagues began playing on indoor and outdoor rinks, the flooring or playing surface was referred to as \"the dek\". An example would be two players speaking about a dek hockey game - \"John had a great game playing center tonight out there on the dek.\"\n\nBall hockey got its name when people started forming street hockey leagues where they played with a ball rather than a puck. In order to recruit players, league leaders and players needed to be specific about what type of street hockey they were asking people to play. An example would be one player speaking to another potential player - Bill - \"Hey Joe I think you would be a good player in my street hockey league.\" Joe \"What type of league is it? Ball or puck?\" Bill - \"It's a ball hockey league.\"\n\nThere are difference between dek hockey and ball hockey in terms of how the games are played, but these differences are strictly a matter of rules and regulations that are invoked during tournament play.\n\nDek hockey rules stipulate the following:\n\n\nBall Hockey rules stipulate the following:\n\n\nRoller Hockey is divided into two categories which are based on the type of skates used: Quad hockey and Inline Hockey. This image provides a visual explanation for the various forms of hockey that all fall under the umbrella of floor hockey:\n\nA fairly new and popular alternative to playing hockey on the street in Canada is to play in outdoor lacrosse boxes. The lacrosse boxes contain the same asphalt surface as the streets, but offers a more realistic feeling of hockey since the playing area is larger than the average street, in addition to having boards that surround the lacrosse box. Players also do not need to worry about traffic and pedestrians. However, one downside to this is the smaller size of in-place lacrosse nets.\n\nSimilarly to lacrosse boxes, outdoor rinks are becoming quite popular in public areas around the United States. These rinks allow for a place to play off of what can often become dangerous streets. Outdoor rinks are usually covered in a sport interlocking plastic tile surface so equipment does not wear down as quickly as on asphalt. Some are concrete which is painted with a special paint designed to provide traction for feet and roller blades. Many rinks are also covered to allow play during wet weather, and lighted for nighttime hockey. There are also a large number of indoor rinks sprinkled throughout the United States and Canada. No official tally has been made as to the number of indoor rinks but the unofficial count is over 500 combining Canada and the United States.\n\nOverall, equipment for street hockey is based on that of ice hockey, but it is lighter and more flexible and with no checking allowed. All of the ice hockey-style equipment is necessary except for certified helmets body checks. In pickup style games, most \"player tend to play with some combination of the following: hockey gloves, shin guards, eye protection, athletic support, and mouth guards. Shin guards are often of the soccer type when the game is played on foot, though several companies now manufacturer and sell shin pads that are lightweight and durable which have been specifically designed for and are marketed for street and roller hockey. Goalies still typically wear equipment similar in appearance to their ice hockey counterparts for safety but partly also to help block more of the goal area. However, such goalie equipment used in street hockey is generally lighter than that used in ice hockey due to the reduced weight and density of the ball (or puck) that is typically used in street hockey as compared to the hard vulcanized rubber puck used in ice hockey.\n\nA street hockey stick is similar to an ice hockey stick in shape and size, but made of materials that will better stand up to use on asphalt or a similar playing surface. It has two main parts, the shaft and the blade. The shaft is often made of aluminum, graphite, or wood. The blade is usually made of some type of plastic, typically a blend of polyurethane, and attaches to the shaft by insertion into the shaft, with the inside of the shaft being coated with a specialized type of glue that requires heating to settle and solidify. Other shafts are designed to have the blade screwed onto the shaft and secured in place with screws. Some street hockey sticks are made in one-piece form and are made out of plastic, polyurethane, graphite, aluminum, wood, or a blend of these and other materials. Ice hockey and inline hockey sticks can also be used. However, street hockey sticks are usually cheaper and more durable for playing on asphalt and concrete, and as such are more common for this reason where the game is played on those surfaces. In organized dek and ball hockey leagues, most players use more expensive sticks as the quality of game play is much higher caliber than pickup street hockey and the Mulit Modular Surfaces see the games played which allow a safer and faster version of Dekhockey and are mmuch safer for running that concrete or blacktop.\n\nWith the success of the widely used orange ball for street hockey, many different color varieties have been introduced due to changing balls for weather conditions, such as yellow, red, pink, and even a glow in the dark ball. Several ball manufacturers now market the balls with the temperature range the ball was designed for on the packaging itself. Most hockey ball manufacturers sell their balls according to the following temperature range: red/orange = hot/warm above 60 degrees, pink = cool - between 40-60 degrees, yellow = cold - below 40 degrees. A tennis ball or whiffle ball can also be used as an alternative to the orange ball for street hockey, as it is much softer than the orange ball, therefore reducing the risk of injury.\n\nThe International Street and Ball Hockey Federation is the worldwide governing body of official ball hockey tournaments and leagues, and they officially recognize two types of balls for play: a hard, warm climate ball for adult or youth play or a softer version for colder weather.\n\nThe International Street and Ball Hockey Federation is officially recognized as the governing body of the sport by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The non-profit was founded in 1993 and has provided international competitions since 1995.\n\nThe Canadian Ball Hockey Association is the official governing body of ball hockey in Canada as recognized by the I.S.B.H.F.\nThe American Street Hockey Institute is the official governing body of street and dek hockey in the United States as recognized by the I.S.B.H.F.\n\nSeveral European and Asian countries have their own governing bodies where the sport has enough players to have a national following and presence. Generally, these countries have rule books based upon either the Canadian, American, or I.S.B.H.F. rule books, or a combination of some type of these.\n\nThe International Street and Ball Hockey Federation holds several international tournaments with most being broken down by age groups and gender. These tournaments are typically bi-annual, such as the Men's and Women's 20 and over, the Men's and Women's Under 20, the Men's and Women's Under 18 and the Men's and Women's Under 16. There are also a Men's Masters Tournament for players aged 40 and over and a Women's Masters Tournament for players aged 35 and over.\n\nThere are dozens of tournaments held throughout North America every year. Typically tournaments start on a Friday and end on Sunday evenings.\n\nJenna Goldstrich, a famous street hockey legend, has won the most tournaments in North America and internationally.\n\nAccording to the ISBHF, there are street hockey leagues in over 60 countries worldwide. As mentioned in the history section, one can safely assume that where ever people are playing ice hockey, people are also playing some form of street hockey.\n\n"}

{"id": "952721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=952721", "title": "Carling Black Label", "text": "Carling Black Label\n\nBlack Label is a Canadian brand of lager distributed by Carling and well-known throughout the former British Empire. In several countries, it is also known as Carling Black Label, and in Sweden, it is known as Carling Premier. In the United Kingdom it is now known as just Carling.\n\nAlthough its original focus was on ale, Carling has been brewing lager-style beers since the 1870s. In 1927, as part of an overall corporate re-branding effort under new president J. Innes Carling, the company renamed its already popular Black & White Lager to Black Label. \n\nThree years later, Carling was purchased by Toronto business tycoon E. P. Taylor, who merged the company into his Canadian Breweries Limited (CBL), which grew to be the world's largest brewing company, at least for a time. Under Taylor, Black Label was promoted as CBL's flagship brand and went on to become the world's first beer to be brewed on a mass international scale, becoming particularly popular in Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nIn response to a shift in popular taste away from ale, Carling added a three-storey lager plant to their main London, Ontario, brewery in 1877. Carling's Lager (later renamed Carling's Bavarian Stock Lager, and then Carling's Imperial Club Lager) was the company's first lager brand. Carling's Black & White Lager was introduced in the 1920s and later renamed Black Label Lager, in contrast to their recently launched Red Cap Ale.\n\nDue to its strength and price, the brand quickly became popular with the country's working class, perhaps most famously among the loggers and miners of Northern Ontario, where the brand gained a tough, blue-collar image.\n\nAround 1990, Black Label had an advertising campaign in Canada, which used the phrase \"The Legend is Black.\"\n\nAfter the repeal of prohibition in 1933, the Peerless Motor Car Company, looking for a way to diversify in the poor car market of the depression, purchased the American rights to Carling's formulas, identifying labels, and trademarks. Technicians and brewmasters were sent from Canada to convert a Peerless plant in Cleveland, Ohio, into the Brewing Corporation of America. They first tried just brewing Carling's Red Cap Ale, but sales were too slow to maintain the brewery, and sales didn't climb until the introduction of Black Label lager. The philosophy behind Black Label was to have a high quality lager that was available nationwide but with a locally brewed budget price. The strategy worked, and the next several decades led to rapid growth and expansion for the brewery and the Carling Black Label brand.\n\nWhen Carling stopped producing Black Label to focus on a more profitable lager, they found their sales plummeting. Carling re-introduced Black Label with a beautiful blonde named Mabel, portrayed by Jeanne Goodspeed, with the slogan \"Hey Mabel, Black Label!\". The twenty-year marketing campaign cemented the name in the popular culture of America.\n\nIn 1979, after several years of intense pressure from the larger American Brewers Miller and Anheuser-Busch, Carling-National was bought out by the Heileman Brewing Co. of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Carling and the Black Label brand are currently owned by the Molson Coors Brewing Company. Though no longer widely distributed in the U.S., Black Label remains the official beer of Beer Frisbee.\n\nBlack Label was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1952. Originally, it was only available in bottles, but in 1965, The Hill Top in Sheffield became the first pub to pour Carling on draught.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, Carling Black Label sales were driven to great heights, due partly to increased advertising support, in particular the classic \"I bet he drinks\" series of advertisements, and partly with the launch of Carling Black Label in cans. Cans were important to Carling's success as they helped open up the \"take home\" market. \n\nThe \"I bet he drinks\" series of ads showed someone doing something cool, clever or difficult, and having a bystander say \"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label\". With the help of this advertising campaign, it became Britain's best-selling brand of beer in 1971. In the 1980s, many of the adverts featured comedians Mark Arden and Stephen Frost, also known as The Oblivion Boys, delivering the classic punchline. One of the advertisements in the series, \"Dambusters\" from 1989, was a parody of the 1955 film of the same name, and was ranked at number 12 on ITV's list of the \"Best Ever Ads\" in 2005, and at number 17 on Channel 4's list of the \"100 Greatest TV Ads\" in 2000. Campaign Live also ranked it at number 5 in their list of the \"Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time\" in 2008.\n\nCarling has remained Britain's best selling beer since 1985. The Black Label was dropped from the name in 1997 and the brand's logo was updated.\n\nIn South Africa, Black Label began to take on a different tone with the anti-apartheid movement. This was partly due to the fact that, at 5.5%, it had more alcohol than the other brands of beer that generally had 5.0%, as noted in the popular advertising catch phrase \"only hard working students deserve an extra 0.5 percent.\" \n\nFurthermore, the connotation of black to the racial issue became a point of pride to the native Africans. It used to be sold with the motto, \"America's Lusty, Lively Beer\", perhaps in reference to Canada, though it is seldom seen in the United States. The motto came from an older advertising campaign in the United States. Another famous Afrikaans slogan for Black Label in South Africa is, \"\"Black Label sê die bybel\"\", which means \"The Bible says (one should drink) Black Label.\"\n\nThe beer was parodied by South African T-shirt company Laughitoff. The slogan was changed to \"Black Labour, White Guilt\", which led to an unsuccessful trademark infringement lawsuit from SABMiller.\n\n"}

{"id": "957075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=957075", "title": "Mokusatsu", "text": "Mokusatsu\n\nIt was the adoption of this term by the government of Japan that first gave rise to the prominence of the word abroad. \"Mokusatsu\" was used in a response to the Allied demand in the Potsdam Declaration that Japan surrender unconditionally in World War II. It was understood to mean that Japan had rejected those terms, a perceived outright rejection that contributed to President Harry S. Truman's decision to carry out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, implying that, in spurning the terms, Japan had brought down on its own head the destruction of those two cities.\n\nThe Allies were aware that within the Japanese government an attempt to reach a negotiated termination of hostilities had been underway, especially via diplomatic contacts with Moscow, which was still neutral. The Potsdam declaration presented one further occasion for mediation, but it was strongly opposed by the War Minister General Korechika Anami, with backing from the army and navy chiefs of staff, all demanding that the Declaration be rejected with a broadcast containing a point by point rebuttal. The Army also demanded that the public be kept unaware of the Declaration. In a compromise, the Foreign Minister Tōgō Shigenori gained a Cabinet consensus to have the Declaration translated and released to the public, but in a censored version that deleted mentions of an imminent \"utter destruction of the Japanese homeland,\" \"stern justice\" for all war criminals, that disarmed soldiers would be allowed to return home to live constructive lives in peace, and comments about \"self-willed military cliques.\" The version given to the public was issued by the 'tightly controlled press' through the Dōmei News Service.\n\nIn this form it appeared in the morning edition of the \"Asahi Shinbun\" on July 28, 1945, to designate the attitude assumed by the government to the Potsdam Declaration. This newspaper and others clearly stated that the ultimatum, which had not only been transmitted to the Japanese government diplomatically via Swiss intermediaries and but also to the Japanese public via radio and airdropped leaflets, was formally rejected by the Imperial Government. Later that day in a press conference, the Premier Suzuki Kantarō himself publicly used it to dismiss the Potsdam Declarations as a mere rehash (\"yakinaoshi\") of earlier rejected Allied proposals, and therefore, being of no value.\n\nSuzuki's actual words were:\n\nMy thinking is that the joint declaration is virtually the same as the earlier declaration. The government of Japan does not consider it having any crucial value. We simply . The only alternative for us is to be determined to continue our fight to the end.\n\nSuzuki apparently recognized that the Potsdam declaration flagged an intention to end a war which, in logistical terms, Japan was no longer capable of sustaining. However Article 6 stated that the militarists would be stripped of their authority and power forever, and the Japanese army was resolutely opposed to its own thorough dismantlement, and heavy pressure was brought to bear on the Prime Minister therefore to have him reject the declaration.\n\nSuzuki's stating that the declarations terms would be literally 'killed off by silent contempt'(\"mokusatsu\") reflected this necessity of placating the extreme position of the army. John Toland also argued decades later that Suzuki's choice of the term was dictated more by the need to appease the military, which was hostile to the idea of \"unconditional surrender\", than to signal anything to the Allies.\n\nAlthough \"mokusatsu\" may not have been intended to communicate to the Allies a refusal to surrender, the Potsdam ultimatum nevertheless allowed for only one acceptable answer: unconditional surrender. Any other answer would, as the declaration warned, cause \"prompt and utter destruction\". It was only after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs, two assassination attempts on the then Prime Minister Suzuki Kantarō, an attempted military coup against the Emperor (the Kyūjō Incident), and a declaration of war by the Soviet Union that the Emperor himself broadcast acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, i.e., unconditional surrender, ending the Pacific War.\n\nSome years after the war, it was claimed that it was questionable whether the Japanese press had acted on reliable government sources when they first announced the that the Declaration's terms had been rebuffed. This position was outlined in 1950 in an English article by Kazuo Kawai, who based his argument on notes and diaries written at the time, notes taken while he covered the discussions underway in Japan's Foreign Office regarding the Declaration. Kawai argued that both the choice of this term and the meaning given to it by Allied authorities led to a fatal 'tragedy of errors' involving both Japanese bureaucratic bungling and a 'deficiency in perception' by Japan's enemies. Kawai's point was then taken up by William J. Coughlin in a widely read article for \"Harper's\" magazine three years later.\n\nIn some reconstructions that espouse this interpretation, it is stated that it was probably Hasegawa Saiji, a translator for Dōmei Press, who translated this as: \"The Japanese ignores this, and we are determined to continue our fight until the end\" and the foreign press picked this up, taking \"ignore\" to mean \"reject\".\n\nThe NSA Technical Journal published an article endorsing this view that the word's meaning was ambiguous in which readers are warned of the consequences of not making ambiguities clear when translating between languages. It concluded:\n\nTo this day, the argument that \"mokusatsu\" was misunderstood, and that the misunderstanding interrupted a negotiation for a peaceful end to the war still resurfaces from time to time.\n\nThe consensus of modern historians is that the Allies had understood the word correctly. Chalmers Johnson wrote in 1980:\n'Since the characters for mokusatsu mean 'silent kill,' most informed commentators believe that the Allies did not mistranslate Suzuki. If he really meant 'no comment,' that is not what he said -and \"mokusatsu\" does not imply it, even obliquely. However, the fact that the Japanese and Emmerson maintain that Suzuki's nuance was misunderstood illustrates the tendency of the Japanese to take refuge in alleged mistranslations.' \n\nLike Herbert Bix concluded:\n'“No need to rush” directly contravened Article 5 of the Potsdam Declaration\n(“We shall brook no delay”) and as a position that further strengthened the contemporary Western analysis that, as of 28 July, the Japanese, following the leadership of their emperor, had neither reversed their decision, nor loosened their will to fight to the finish, while making vague overtures for peace on a separate track. Suzuki’s intention was not misunderstood.'\n\n"}

{"id": "958287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=958287", "title": "Kofola", "text": "Kofola\n\nKofola () is a carbonated soft drink produced by Czech company Kofola, headquartered in Krnov, Czech Republic. It is the principal rival of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nKofola originated in the Czechoslovak Research Institute of Medicinal Plants in Prague now Czech Republic in 1959, during research targeted at finding a possible use for surplus caffeine produced in the process of coffee roasting. The resulting dark-coloured, sweet-and-sour syrup \"Kofo\" became the main ingredient of a new soft drink named \"Kofola\" introduced in 1960. During the 1960s and 1970s Kofola became exceedingly popular in communist Czechoslovakia because it substituted for Western cola-based drinks like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, which were not generally available. Even today, Kofola is a popular option in restaurants as can be draught from kegs right into glass.\n\nSince 1998 Kofola has been bottled (in addition to classical 0.33-litre glass bottles) in 0.5-litre and 2-litre plastic bottles. 0.25-litre cans were introduced in 2003, 1-litre plastic-bottles in December 2004. Kofola draught from 50-litre kegs, traditionally sold in many bars and restaurants across the two countries, is very popular as well.\n\nSince 2002 the producer has launched a successful media campaign aimed at a young and hip audience based on the slogan \"\"Když ji miluješ, není co řešit / Keď ju miluješ, nie je čo riešiť\"\" (\"\"If you love it, there is nothing to question\"\"). Until 2000, the Kofola logo featured a coffee bean. It now resembles a coffee flower.\n\nAfter the fall of the Communist regime in 1989, Kofola had to compete with many foreign brands that entered the attractive newly opened market. After a period of decline and trademark lawsuits (many companies produced their own similarly tasting \"kofola\" because the term became a genericized trademark), in 2000 the \"Santa nápoje\" company, owned by the Greek-immigrant Samaras family, became the only producer and distributor of Kofola in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Other producers of similar drinks had to rename their products (most notable are Hejkola and Šofokola).\n\nThe company \"Santa nápoje\" originally produced Kofola drink only in the parent factory in Krnov. In 2002, the company built a new factory in Rajecká Lesná, Slovakia, to satisfy the demand of the Slovak market. In 2003, \"Santa nápoje\" changed its name to \"Kofola, a.s.\" and later to \"Kofola ČeskoSlovensko a.s\". Apart from Kofola it also produces other soft drinks, the spring water Rajec, the fresh fruit juices UGO, the syrups Jupí and children's drink Jupík, RC Cola under license and from 2008 the grape drink Vinea, that are exported to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia.\n\nIn 2008 Kofola announced a merger with the Polish lemonade producer Hoop. In autumn 2008, the Polish Private Equity fund Enterprise Investors acquired in a Public Tender Offer 42.46% of Kofola-Hoop for approximately €140 million. In 2009, the Polish company Kofola-Hoop S.A. was renamed into Kofola S.A.\n\nIn April 2009, Kofola acquired Pinelli and since then has produced the energy drink Semtex. In 2010, Kofola opened a new factory in Mnichovo Hradiště. In December 2014, Kofola bought Slovenian factory for mineral water Radenska.\n\nKofo syrup, the main ingredient of Kofola, consists of 14 herbal and fruit ingredients (such as extracts from apple, cherry, currant, or herbal aroma), sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup (2014), and caramel. In comparison with Pepsi or Coca-Cola it contains 30% less sugar, ~56% more caffeine (15 mg/100ml, Coca-Cola 9.6 mg/100ml) and it does not contain phosphoric acid.\n\n\nA Christmas limited edition with a hint of cinnamon was introduced at the end of 2007, and was only available around the Christmas period. In 2011-2016 was sold another variant of the drink called \"Kofola Extra Herbal\", it was extended with dandelion, gentian and peppermint. Other flavours introduced in limited editions include: cherry, pomegranate, almond, gingerbread, chocolate, coconut, walnut, plum, pear and mandarin.\n\nThe most popular cocktail with kofola is a highball made of kofola, Czech Tuzemák (domestic rum) and lemon juice called \"Kofrum\", \"Handlová Libre\", \"Student lemonade\", \"Rebel\" or \"Chequia Libre\". Kofola with pilsner lager beer is called \"Kofola 'n' Beer\" or \"Diesel\".\n\n"}

Between August 2014 and April 2015, a New York restaurant served broth from the same perpetual stew (a master stock) for over eight months.\n\nVarious ingredients can be used in a perpetual stew, such as root vegetables and tubers (onion, carrot, potato, garlic, parsnip, turnip, etc.) and various meats and game meats.\n"}

It was the more expensive and more popular version of the Pensie Pinkie (made by Penn Racquet Sports). These balls are commonly used in street games developed in the mid-20th century, such as Chinese handball (a variation on American handball), stoop ball, hit-the-penny (involving trying to make a penny flip on a sidewalk), butts up, handball, punchball, half-rubber, and stickball (a variation of baseball).\n\nThe term arose from a New York City-accented pronunciation of Spalding, the sporting goods company that produced the balls. The name has become so common that Spalding now uses it in marketing, and it is now a registered trademark.\n\nSpaldeens were popular with children from the 1930s through to the 1970s. In urban areas sparse in grass, Spaldeens became integral to many street games due to their bounciness and light weight. Citing the declining popularity of stickball, Spalding took the ball off the market in 1979, but it returned in 1999 to much fanfare.\n\nSince its return in 1999 Spaldeens have been manufactured in a variety of colors in addition to pink.

Sets of two or more coloured stripes have traditionally been used as part of the distinctive visual identity of these institutions. The scarves are usually made of Saxony Wool and traditionally 6 feet (c. 2m) long. \n\nThe colours are usually derived from the colours of the official coat of arms or the varsity colours, and are used in clothing and symbols of all kinds, from ties to trophies, but notably in the long woollen winter scarves that students and alumni wear to show their pride in their institutions. Some universities have different scarves for different faculties and even for undergraduates and postgraduates. Strictly speaking, proper academic scarves should not have further embroidery on them, such as the 'crests' or logos, as the stripes are sufficient to identify the scarf's origins and affiliation. \n\nAt some universities, in addition to collegiate scarves, there are also several non-collegiate scarves which have a well-established meaning. For example, those representing the University in sport may be entitled to wear a particular scarf, depending on their level of achievement, or a university department or club may have its own scarf. In addition, some colleges and universities have (for example) separate scarves for senior clubs such as their Boat Clubs.\n\nAcademic scarves are to be distinguished from other types of scarves that are officially sold by the institution themselves which often use different colours and are embroidered with logos and other emblem. \n\nThe term scarfies is often used in and around Dunedin, the site of the University of Otago, as a slang term for university students.\n\n"}
{"id": "967743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=967743", "title": "Baseball (ball)", "text": "Baseball (ball)\n\nA baseball is a ball used in the sport of the same name. The ball features a rubber or cork center, wrapped in yarn, and covered, in the words of the Official Baseball Rules \"with two strips of white horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together.\" It is 9–9 inches (229–235mm) in circumference (–in. or 73–75mm in diameter), and masses from 5 to 5oz. (142 to 149g). The yarn or string used to wrap the baseball can be up to one mile (1.6 km) in length. Some are wrapped in a plastic-like covering.\n\nA significant quality of the baseball is the stitching that holds together the covering of the ball. After a ball has been pitched, these raised stitches catch the air and cause the ball to swerve slightly on its way to the catcher. Whether the ball swerves to the right, to the left, downward, or a combination thereof, and whether it swerves sharply or gradually, depends on which direction, and how fast, the stitches have been made to spin by the pitcher. See, for example, curveball, slider, two-seam fastball, four-seam fastball, sinker, cutter.\n\nIn the early, mid-1800s days of baseball, there was a great variety in the size, shape, weight, and manufacturing of baseballs. Early baseballs were made from a rubber core from old, melted shoes, wrapped in yarn and leather. Fish eyes were also used as cores in some places. Pitchers usually made their own balls, which were used throughout the game, softening and coming unraveled as the game went on. One of the more popular earlier ball designs was the \"lemon peel ball,\" named after its distinct four lines of stitching design. Lemon peel balls were darker, smaller, and weighed less than other baseballs, prompting them to travel further and bounce higher, causing very high-scoring games. \n\nIn the mid-1850s, teams in New York met in attempt to standardize the baseball. They decided to regulate baseballs to weighing between 5.5–6 oz and having a circumference of 8–11 inches. There were still many variations of baseballs since they were completely handmade. Balls with more rubber and a tighter winding went further and faster (known as \"live balls\"), and balls with less rubber and a looser winding (known as \"dead balls\") did not travel as far or fast. This is generally true for all baseballs. Teams often used this knowledge to their advantage, as players from the team usually manufactured their own baseballs to use in games.\n\nThere is no agreement on who invented the commonplace figure-8 stitching on baseballs. Some historians say that it was invented by Ellis Drake, a shoemaker's son, to make the cover stronger and more durable. Others say it was invented by Colonel William A. Cutler and sold to William Harwood in 1858. Harwood built a factory in Natick, Massachusetts, and was the first to popularize and mass-produce baseballs with the figure-8 design. \n\nIn 1876, the National League (NL) was created, and standard rules and regulations were put in place. A.G. Spalding, a well-known baseball pitcher who made his own balls, convinced the NL to adopt his ball as the official baseball for the NL. It remained that way for 100 years.\n\nIn 1910, the cork-core ball was introduced. They outlasted rubber core baseballs; and for the first few years they were used, balls were hit farther and faster than rubber core balls. It eventually went back to normal. Pitchers adapted with the use of the spitball, which is now illegal, and an emphasis on changing the ball.\n\nIn 1920, a couple of important changes were made to baseballs. They began to be made using machine winders and a higher grade of yarn from Australia. Although there was no evidence that these balls impacted the game, offensive statistics rose throughout the 1920s, and both players and fans believed that the new balls helped batters hit the ball farther.\n\nIn 1925, Milton Reach patented his \"cushion cork\" center. It was a cork core surrounded by black rubber, then another layer of red rubber.\n\nIn 1934, The National League and American League came to a compromise and standardized the baseball. They agreed on a cushion cork center; two wrappings of yarn; a special rubber cement coating; two more wrappings of yarn; and, finally, a horsehide cover.\n\nBaseballs have gone through only a few small changes since the compromise. During World War II, the US banned the use of rubber for non war-related goods, including for baseballs. So in 1943, instead of using rubber, baseballs were made with rubberlike shells of \"balata\"; a substance, obtained from a particular type of tropical tree, that was also used in golf balls. Hitting declined significantly in 1943.\n\nThe introduction of synthetic rubber in 1944 resulted in baseballs returning to normal. Offense would return to normal after the change back to the regular ball and return of players from active duty.\n\nIn 1974, baseballs covers were switched from horsehide to cowhide.\n\nIn 1976, MLB stopped using Spalding for manufacturing their baseballs and started using Rawlings.\n\nCushioned wood cores were patented in the late 19th century by sports equipment manufacturer Spalding, the company founded by former baseball star A.G. Spalding. In recent years, various synthetic materials have been used to create baseballs; however, they are generally considered lower quality, stiched with two red thick thread, and are not used in the major leagues. Using different types of materials affects the performance of the baseball. Generally a tighter-wound baseball will leave the bat faster, and fly farther. Since the baseballs used today are wound tighter than in previous years, notably the dead-ball era that prevailed through 1920, people often say that the ball is \"\"juiced\"\". The height of the seams also affects how well a pitcher can pitch. Generally, in Little League through college leagues, the seams are markedly higher than balls used in professional leagues.\n\nIn the early years of the sport, only one ball was typically used in each game, unless it was too damaged to be usable; balls hit into the stands were retrieved by team employees in order to be put back in play, as is still done today in most other sports. Over the course of a game, a typical ball would become discolored due to dirt, and often tobacco juice and other materials applied by players; damage would also occur, causing slight rips and seam bursts. This would lower the offense during the games giving pitchers an advantage. However, after the 1920 death of batter Ray Chapman after being hit in the head by a pitch, perhaps due to his difficulty in seeing the ball during twilight, an effort was made to replace dirty or worn baseballs. \n\nIn 1909, sports magnate and former player Alfred J. Reach patented the ivory centered \"\"ivory nut\"\" in Panama and suggested it might be even better in a baseball than cork. However, Philadelphia Athletics president Benjamin F. Shibe, who had invented and patented the cork centered ball, commented, \"\"I look for the leagues to adopt an 'ivory nut' baseball just as soon as they adopt a ferro-concrete bat and a base studded with steel spikes.\"\" Both leagues adopted Shibe's cork-centered ball in 1910.\n\nThe official major league ball is made by Rawlings, which produces the stitched balls in Costa Rica. Attempts to automate the manufacturing process were never entirely successful, leading to the continued use of hand-made balls. The raw materials are imported from the United States, assembled into baseballs and shipped back.\n\nThroughout the 20th Century, Major League Baseball used two technically identical but differently marked balls. The American League had \"\"Official American League\"\" and the American League's president's signature in blue ink, while National League baseballs had \"\"Official National League\"\" and the National League president's signature in black ink. According to Bob Feller, in the 1930s, when he was a rookie in the National League, baseball laces were black, intertwined with red; the American League's were blue and red. In 2000, Major League Baseball reorganized its structure to eliminate the position of league presidents, and switched to one ball specification for both leagues. Under the current rules, a major league baseball weighs between , and is in circumference ( in diameter). There are 108 double stitches on a baseball, or 216 individual stitches.\n\nToday, several dozen baseballs are used in a typical professional game, due to scratches, discoloration, and undesirable texture that can occur during the game. Balls hit out of the park for momentous occasions (record setting, or for personal reasons) are often requested to be returned by the fan who catches it, or donated freely by the fan. Usually, the player will give the fan an autographed bat and/or other autographed items in exchange for the special ball.\n\nBalls used in the professional game are rubbed with a mud known as \"rubbing mud\", which is typically applied by the umpire before each game, and is intended to help the pitcher's grip.\n\nThere are different types of baseball used.\n\n\nThere are several historic instances of people catching, or attempting to catch, baseballs tied to MLB milestones:\nOther famous baseballs:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "968113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=968113", "title": "Swedish Rite", "text": "Swedish Rite\n\nThe Swedish Rite is a variation or Rite of Freemasonry that is common in Scandinavian countries and to a limited extent in Germany. It is different from other branches of Freemasonry in that, rather than having the three self-contained foundation degrees and seemingly-endless side degrees and appendant bodies, it has an integrated system with ten degrees. It is also different in that, rather than moving through the offices or 'chairs', progress in the Swedish Rite is based on moving through the ten degrees. A fundamental difference is the Swedish Rite's position on religious affiliation: Masonry as recognized by the United Grand Lodge of England requires a belief in God, but accepts candidates of any theistic religion, whereas Swedish Masonry is specifically Christian, and requires a Christian trinitarian belief in all its members. Nonetheless, the main Swedish Rite constitutions are all recognised as regular by the United Grand Lodge of England, and stand in full amity.\n\nThe Swedish Rite is the default and customary Masonic rite in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. In Finland there exists an agreement of shared jurisdiction between the native Grand Lodge of Finland, working standard Anglo-American tradition Masonry, and a Provincial Grand Lodge of the Swedish Rite Swedish Order of Freemasons. A variant form of the Swedish Rite is worked in Germany by the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany, where it is one of five different Masonic systems that co-exist within the umbrella group the United Grand Lodges of Germany.\n\nAlthough fully independent of each other, the Scandinavian Grand Lodges work closely together to ensure that their rituals are as similar as possible.\n\nSince 7 November 2006 all laws of the Swedish Order of Freemasons are publicly available on the Internet. Among others, the laws prohibit any member to gain advantages outside the lodge by using the lodge as an instrument. The laws also stress the charity works of the members and the observance of the Golden Rule.\n\nThe Swedish Rite has approximately 16,500 members in the Swedish Obedience (of which 15,200 are in Sweden and 1,300 in Finland), 8000 in Denmark, 3,500 in Iceland, and 16,700 in Norway.\n\nMembers must be at least twenty-one years of age and of good repute; they must be recommended by at least two members, one of whom must have at least the seventh degree and the other at least the third. The traditional rule that a candidate must come of his own will and accord is enforced within the Swedish Rite and solicitation of members is strictly prohibited.\n\nA final requirement is that the candidate professes to adhere to a mainstream Christian faith, assert that it is the best of all possible religions, and swear never to abandon it. If the Christian belief of the candidate is in doubt, a birth certificate may be requested; in the Scandinavian countries, birth certificates contain a field for religion. Owing to the religious history of the Scandinavian nations, Swedish Rite Freemasonry has strong connections with the various national Lutheran churches, which are the majority churches of all the Swedish Rite nations. However, members of any Trinitarian Christian denomination are accepted into membership. Membership of certain sects which are unrecognised by the World Council of Churches does not qualify a candidate for membership of the Swedish Rite; these include the Mormons, the Unification Church (the Moonies), and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nSwedish Rite-masonry has ten degrees divided into three groups. The first two groups are called lodges, while the third is called simply Chapter. I.-III.-degree masons meet in a St. John's lodge (equivalent to Blue Lodge or Craft Lodge). IV-V. and VI.-degree masons meet in a St. Andrew's lodge (in some areas equivalent to the Scottish Rite) while VII.-X.-degree masons meet in their respective Chapter.\n\nAs a cherished relic from the previously practised Rite of Strict Observance, The Grand Lodge of Denmark maintains a Novice-degree in between the VII. and VIII.-degree.\n\nAll grand lodge officers have to be Knights and Commanders of the Red Cross or simply \"R&K\", of which there are a limited number. Though not formally a degree, grand lodge officers, as a means of expressing the hierarchical nature of the order, are sometimes said to have obtained the XI.-degree. Since being a Knight and Commander of the Red Cross is linked with the duties of a grand lodge office, only a very few Swedish Rite-masons will become one.\n\n\nSt. John's, St. Andrews and Chapter work are done in different rooms or buildings. While many towns have a St. John's (Craft) Lodge, fewer have a St. Andrews Lodge. There is only one Chapter per masonic district.\n\nIn Denmark, Norway and Germany a mason will retain his craft lodge-membership while advancing through the St. Andrew's and Chapter degrees, and pay dues to all. In Denmark, dues are collected by the Danish Order of Freemasons and distributed to the relevant St. John's, St. Andrews and Chapter-organisations.\n\nIn Sweden, Finland, and Iceland a mason will not retain his craft lodge-membership, when he advances to the IV-V.-degree, or his St. Andrew's Lodge-membership, when he advances to the VII.-degree. Also, dues are paid only to the lodge which the mason is presently a member of. Because of the sometimes large distance between one's home and the closest St. Andrew's Lodge, travel outlays can be excessive. To remedy this, Square-and-Compasses Clubs or Friendship Clubs were created in small towns so that St. Andrew's or Chapter Freemasons can socialise without travelling inordinate distances; in Denmark these are called Instruction Lodges. Friendship Clubs cannot confer degrees, except by dispensation from Grand Lodge.\n\nSwedish freemasons can in rare cases be awarded with the Order of Charles XIII. This is a Royal order of chivalry, equivalent to a knighthood and given only to Knights-Commander of the Red Cross at the King's pleasure; its members may not number more than thirty-three, and three of them must be ecclesiastics of the established Lutheran Church. Although it is jokingly termed the 'twelfth degree', the Order of Charles XIII is in no way a part of the official Swedish Rite, and is not classed as a masonic degree.\n\nThe Masonic ring is given in the eighth degree, and consists of the customary red St. Andrew's Cross and sometimes the Masonic motto, \"Veritas Persuadet\". It is worn on the index finger of the right hand. A Knight of the West is also made to design his own coat of arms, taking the traditional European rules of heraldry into account. The resulting coat-of-arms hangs in his Provincial Grand Lodge.\n\nThe tenth degree is the highest ordinarily attainable; it can be received after roughly twentyone years of regular attendance and good proficiency in the ritual, but the time between the degrees may be shorter if the member is active and accepts different offices in his lodges.\n\nThe lodges are managed by a Worshipful Master, who will be assisted by one or more Deputy Masters (these are given Latin ordinal names: primary, secondary, and so forth). There are also the Primary and Secondary Wardens, a Master of Ceremonies, a Secretary, a Treasurer, an Orator, and a Director of Music.\n\nThe lodge offices do not rotate as in e.g. American freemasonry. A mason is not obliged or expected to take up an office, nor is there a progression between the offices. E.g.: Any man holding the appropriate degree may campaign for election as Worshipful Master without ever having held any office before, and the same holds for all the other offices of the Rite.\n\nWhile the Master and his deputies, as well as the Wardens, are voted in, other officers are appointed by the Master. Once elected or appointed one often keeps his position for at least some years, while the Master will usually hold his position for the better part of a decade, though Sweden has a limit of six years per term and a retirement age of 75 year. \n\nThere are rules dictating minimum degrees for the various officers and their substitutes. In Denmark, the officers of a St. John's lodge must uniformly be at least Master Masons; Wardens must be Knights of the East; and the Worshipful Master must be (depending on source) a Knight of the West or a Right Enlightened Brother of St. Andrew.\n\nDeputy officers are fully empowered to take the place of their principals at stated meetings.\n\nThere is a single progression through the degrees of the Swedish Rite, as opposed to the multiple side degrees and appendant bodies of Anglo-American Masonry. Swedish Rite Masons join at the level of an Entered Apprentice, and, with time, become Right Enlightened Brothers of St Andrew.\n\nThe morality and symbolism taught in the St John degrees is the same as that of the Blue Lodge; in addition, Swedish Rite Master Masons and Master Masons elsewhere in the world are fully accepted as visitors in each other's lodges. That said, the layout of a St John's lodge-room and that of a Blue Lodge is entirely different, as is the ritual (excepting, of course, the word and grips of recognition, which are truly international). The central figure of the Master Mason's narrative is Adoniram rather than Hiram Abiff.\n\nThe Swedish Rite places more emphasis on the mystical and the spiritual, in contrast with the Anglo-American version of Freemasonry, which prioritises rote-learning. According to Alex G. Davidson, the mood in an English lodge-room is \"relaxed and friendly\" compared to the \"mysterious and gloomy\", \"intensely solemn and almost mystical... otherworldly atmosphere\" of the Swedish Rite.\n\nThere is less emphasis on rote-learning in the Swedish Rite compared to its English cousin; while English Masonry places importance on so-called word-perfect ritual (that is, committed to memory and repeated without a single deviation from the prepared text), the Swedish Rite prefers candidates to understand the \"spirit\" of the ritual. Accordingly, Lodge officers are given a book from which to read during degree ceremonies; the task of delivering these speeches falls on an officer known as the Orator. Furthermore, candidates are examined on their proficiency of the previous degree: by this is meant that, prior to being passed or raised (as appropriate), candidates are made to write down the salient points of the morality taught by the previous degree.\n\nThe way by which a Lodge in the Swedish Rite is called to work and to refreshment is also different from the English way, and bears mentioning. The Junior and Senior Wardens do not have pedestals that they set on their sides; rather, they wear handle-less, hyperboloidal mallets (similar to the gavel of the U.S. Senate) with which they strike the hilt of their swords.\n\nThe primary foundations of the Swedish Rite are from the late 18th century when Carl Friedrich Eckleff created the first St. Andrews lodge in Stockholm in 1756 and the first Grand Chapter in 1759. His ideas of a truly progressive system to continue the existing system with three degrees was further developed by Duke Karl of Södermanland, the later Charles XIII of Sweden, who also became the Grand Master of the Swedish Order of Freemasons. By 1800 the Swedish rite had fully evolved and has since this primarily had minor changes. In Denmark, the first St. Andrews Lodge started working in 1855 and the first Chapter shortly after in 1858; this effectively marked the beginning of Swedish Rite in Denmark.\n\nThe Swedish Rite is used by:\nAn earlier version of the rite, the Zinnendorf Rite, is used by:\n\n\n\n"}

Plain ladyfingers are commonly given to infants, being soft enough for teething mouths, but easy to grasp and firm enough not to fall apart.\n\nLadyfingers originated in the late 15th century at the court of the Duchy of Savoy and were created to mark the occasion of a visit by the King of France.

They were particularly appreciated by the young members of the court and offered to visitors as a symbol of the local cuisine.\n\nThey have gained many regional names:\n\n\nLike other sponge cakes, ladyfingers traditionally contain no chemical leavening agent, and rely on air incorporated into the eggs for their \"sponge\" texture. However, some brands contain ammonium bicarbonate. The egg whites and egg yolks mixed with sugar are typically beaten separately and folded together with flour. They contain more flour than the average sponge cake.

For this reason, they are often modified by appropriate attributes such as Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom or Luck. Sometimes the throw also represents the chance of penetrating the armor being worn by the character/unit, and so players can either roll for an 'armor save' (as is often the case), or for the unit's 'ward save' or 'invulnerability save' if applicable (this is most notable in \"Warhammer Fantasy\" and \"Warhammer 40,000\"). Magical equipment or spells can also modify saving throw values. A successful saving throw typically either negates or reduces the effectiveness of what is being saved against.\n\nSaving throws are represented as a numeric value that often changes as the character advances in experience. In order to successfully make a throw, the character must roll dice (often a single 20-sided die (\"d20\") or three six-sided dice (\"3d6\")), achieving a result based on the calculated value of the saving throw which is compared against a success value. Under different RPG systems, the roll and/or the success value may have modifiers added or subtracted to determine the outcome.\n\nA gamemaster may also allow a bonus on saving rolls to players who come up with creative ways for their characters to protect themselves.\n\nSome games achieve a similar randomised result by use of other mechanisms including drawing cards, simple contests of luck, or use of tables of random results.\n"}

The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the Renaissance adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles. After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the grand manner; these are also known as draperies.\n\nFor the Greeks, as Sir Kenneth Clark noted, clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: \"floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future.\" Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the Parthenon, where \"it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by Leonardo da Vinci\". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, \"were kept in motion by their flying cloaks.\"\n\nIn Interior Design, Drapery refers almost exclusively to window treatment, either as a focal point in front of the window opening or as a blind to prevent focus on the view beyond the opening. There is general agreement that Drapery in Design is more substantial and weightier than other window treatments such as Curtain paneling. Drapes are also normally lined, whereas Curtain panels normally are not. Drapery is also considered a relatively permanent installation, adding an integral element to the room's design by adding color or pattern to complement the rest of the architectural and soft elements. \n\n"}

It usually consists of a set of cabinets, or cupboards, and one or more drawers, all topped by a wooden surface for conveniently holding food, serving dishes, or lighting devices. The words \"sideboard\" and \"buffet\" are somewhat interchangeable, but if the item has short legs, or a base that sits directly on the floor with no legs, it is more likely to be called a \"sideboard\"; if it has longer legs it is more likely to be called a \"buffet\".\n\nThe earliest versions of the sideboard familiar today made their appearance in the 18th century, but they gained most of their popularity during the 19th century as households became prosperous enough to dedicate a room solely to dining. Sideboards were made in a range of decorative styles and were frequently ornamented with costly veneers and inlays. In later years, sideboards have been placed in living rooms or other areas where household items might be displayed.\n\nIn traditional formal dining rooms today, an antique sideboard is a desirable and fashionable accessory, and finely styled versions from the late-18th or early-19th centuries are the most sought-after and most costly. Among its counterparts in modern furniture styles, the form is often referred to as a server. Some of the earliest production of sideboards arose in England, France, Belgium and Scotland. Later, American designs arose. Characteristic materials used in historic sideboard manufacture include mahogany, oak, pine, and walnut.\n\n"}

{"id": "971278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=971278", "title": "Aspic", "text": "Aspic\n\nAspic is a dish in which ingredients are set into a gelatin made from a meat stock or consommé. Non-savory dishes, often made with commercial gelatin mixes without stock or consommé, are usually called jello salads in the United States or gelatin salads elsewhere.\n\nWhen cooled, stock that is made from meat congeals because of the natural gelatin found in the meat. The stock can be clarified with egg whites, and then filled and flavored just before the aspic sets. Almost any type of food can be set into aspics. Most common are meat pieces, fruits, or vegetables. Aspics are usually served on cold plates so that the gel will not melt before being eaten. A meat jelly that includes cream is called a chaud-froid.\n\nAlmost any meat, poultry, or fish can be used to make gelatin. The aspic may need additional gelatin in order to set properly. Veal stock provides a great deal of gelatin; in making stock, veal is often included with other meat for that reason. Fish consommés usually have too little natural gelatin, so the fish stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth.\n\nVegetables and fish stocks need gelatin to maintain a molded shape.\n\nHistorically, meat aspics were made before fruit- and vegetable-flavored aspics or 'jellies' (UK) and 'gelatins' (North America). By the Middle Ages at the latest, cooks had discovered that a thickened meat broth could be made into a jelly. A detailed recipe for aspic is found in \"Le Viandier\", written in or around 1375.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Marie-Antoine Carême created \"chaud froid\" in France. \"Chaud froid\" means \"hot cold\" in French, referring to foods that were prepared hot and served cold. Aspic was used as a \"chaud froid\" sauce in many cold fish and poultry meals. The sauce added moisture and flavor to the food. Carême invented various types of aspic and ways of preparing it.\nAspic, when used to hold meats, prevents them from becoming spoiled. The gelatin keeps out air and bacteria, keeping the cooked meat fresh.\n\nAspic came into prominence in America in the early 20th century. By the 1950s, meat aspic was a popular dinner staple throughout the United States as were other gelatin-based dishes such as tomato aspic. Cooks used to show off aesthetic skills by creating inventive aspics.\n\nAspic can also be referred as \"aspic gelée\" or \"aspic jelly\". Aspic jelly may be colorless (white aspic) or contain various shades of amber. Aspic can be used to protect food from the air, to give food more flavor, or as a decoration.\n\nThere are three types of aspic: delicate, sliceable, and inedible. The delicate aspic is soft. The sliceable aspic must be made in a terrine or in an aspic mold. It is firmer than the delicate aspic. The inedible aspic is never for consumption. It is usually for decoration. Aspic is often used to glaze food pieces in food competitions to make the food glisten and make it more appealing to the eye. Foods dipped in aspic have a lacquered finish for a fancy presentation. Aspic can be cut into various shapes and be used as a garnish for deli meats or pâtés.\n\nPork jelly is an aspic made from low-grade cuts of pig meat, such as trotters, containing a significant proportion of connective tissue. Pork jelly is a popular appetizer and, nowadays, is sometimes prepared in a more modern version using lean meat, with or without pig leftovers which are substituted with store-bought gelatin. It is very popular in Croatia (especially in the northwest where it's called \"hladetina\" or \"hladnetina\"), Serbia (where it is called \"пихтије/pihtije\"), Poland (where it is called \"galareta\"), in Romania and Moldova (\"piftie\", \"răcitură\"), in Estonia (\"sült\"), in Latvia (\"aukstā gaļa\"), in Lithuania (\"šaltiena\"), in Slovakia (\"huspenina\", \"studeno\"), in Hungary (\"kocsonya\"; can also refer to aspic of other meats), in Greece (where it is called \"pichti\"), in Ukraine originally хішкаi(hishkay) or studinats but since 1930's the russian word was forced to be used except in the worldwide diaspora community. In Russia, Belarus, Ukraine (\"kholodets\", \"kholodne\") during Christmas or Easter, in Russia <nowiki>\"kholodets\"</nowiki> is a traditional winter and especially New Years dish which is eaten with horseradish or mustard, in Vietnam (\"thịt nấu đông\") during Lunar New Year. The meat in pork pies is preserved using pork jelly.\n\nThe preparation of pork jelly includes placing lean pork meat, trotters, rind, ears and snout in a pot of cold water, and letting it cook over a slow fire for three hours. The broth is allowed to cool, while also removing any undesirable fat. Subsequently, white vinegar and the juice of half an orange or lemon can be added to the meat so that it is covered. The entire mixture is then allowed to cool and gel. Bay leaves or chili can be added to the broth for added taste (the Romanian variety is based on garlic and includes no vinegar, orange, lemon, chili, bay leaves, etc.). However, there are many alternate ways of preparing pork jelly, such as the usage of celery, beef and even pig bones. Poultry jellies are made the same way as making pork jelly, but less water is added to compensate for lower natural gelatin content.\n\nPihtije (Serbian Cyrillic: пихтије), pivtija (Macedonian: пивтија), pača (Bulgarian: пача), piftie or răcitură in Romanian is an aspic-like dish, generally made from low-cost pork meat, such as the head, shank and/or hock made into a semi-consistent gelatinous cake-like form. In some varieties, chicken is used instead of pork. Some recipes also include smoked meat.\n\nPihtije is commonly just one component of the traditional meal (or an appetizer), although it can be served as a main dish. It is usually accompanied by cold rakija (strong šljivovica or apricot brandy is common, but quince brandy is sometimes used) and turšija (cold pickled vegetables, usually horse-radish, bell peppers, hot peppers, green tomatoes and cabbage/sauerkraut).\n\nThe recipe calls for the meat to be cleaned, washed and then boiled for a short time, no longer than 5–10 minutes. Then the water is changed, and vegetables and spices are added (usually pepper, bay leaves, onion, carrots, celery). This is cooked until the meat begins to separate from the bones by itself; then, the bones are removed, the meat stock is filtered and the meat and stock are poured into shallow bowls.\n\nGarlic is added, as well as thin slices of carrots or green peppers, or something similar for decoration. It is left to sit in a cold spot, such as a fridge or outside if the weather is cold enough (this is a traditional winter dish). It congeals into jelly and can be cut into cubes (it is often said that good pihtijas are \"cut like glass\"). These cubes can be sprinkled with dried ground red paprika ( aleva paprika ), as desired, before serving.\n\nPihtije is usually cut and served in equal sized cubes.\n\nPihtije are frequently used in slavas and other celebratory occasions with Serbs.\n\nRomanian and Moldovan piftie (răcitură) is usually made with pork offal, boiled with garlic and bay leaves. Piftie has a different method of preparation. Usually the pig's trotters are boiled to make a soup; the trotters are used because they contain a lot more gelatin than any other part of the pig. The mixture is then cooled to become a jelly. Usually garlic is added. Piftie is traditionally served for Epiphany.\n\n\"Jokpyeon\" () is a dish prepared by boiling cow's trotters and/or other cuts with high collagen content, such as cow's head, skin, tail and pig's head in water for a long time, so that the stewing liquid sets to form a jelly-like substance when cooled.\n\nAmong the Newars of Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, buffalo meat jelly--known as \"Ta khaa\" --is a major component of the winter festivity gourmet. It is eaten in combination with fish aspic (\"Sanyaa Khunna\"), which is made from dried fish and buffalo meat stock, soured, and contains a heavy mix of spices and condiments.\n\nIn Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian cuisine, a meat aspic dish is called \"kholodets\" (Russian: холодец, Belarusian: халадзец, Ukrainian: холодець) derived from the word \"kholod\" meaning \"cold.\" In some parts of Russia it is called \"studen\"' (студень), derived from another root with a similar meaning. The dish is mostly part of winter holiday festive meals, although modern refrigerators allow to cook it all year round, and it is not surprising to see kholodets on a Russian table in summer. However, \"kholodets\" is still considered as a traditional New Year's dish in Russia and is usually eaten with mustard. In Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, aspic often takes the form of pork jelly, and it is popular around the Christmas and Easter Holidays. A Georgian version is called mujuji (მუჟუჟი). In Poland certain meats, fish and vegetables are set in aspic, creating a dish called \"galareta\".\n\n\"Kholodets\" are usually made by boiling the bones and meat for about 5-8 hours to produce a fatty broth, mixed with salt, pepper and other spices. After boiling, the meat is separated from the bones and minced into small pieces, then returned into the broth and cooled down until solidifying into a jelly.\nThe Croatian version of this dish is called \"hladetina\" (\"hladno\" meaning cold). Variants range from one served in a dish with lot or rather delicate gelatin, to \"tlačenica\" more resembling German \"Sülze\", a kind of head cheese.\n\nIn Slovenia, aspic is known as \"žolca\", and is traditionally served for Easter. The word comes from the German \"Sülze\", which originally means head cheese (otherwise known as \"tlačenka\" in Slovene).\n\nIn Denmark aspic is called \"sky\" and is mainly used as a topping in open sandwiches, it is made from meat juices and gelatin, sometimes with mushrooms in. Sky is almost solely used in the Danish open faced sandwiches, smørrebrød, where is it a topping for cold cuts. It is in particular important in Dyrlægens natmad (The Veterinarian's Midnight Snack), where it is used with leverpostej, sliced salt beef and onions. It is also used on top of rullepølse. Sky, with and without mushrooms, is an easy-to-find product in all supermarkets.\n\n\n"}

The sandwich consists of a toasted wheat bun, a breaded chicken patty, shredded lettuce, and mayonnaise.\n\nThe sandwich, originally introduced in 1980, proved to be a sales disappointment and was later replaced with the highly successful Chicken McNuggets. But following the success of McNuggets, the McChicken was reintroduced in 1988. But again, McDonald's removed the McChicken from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996, and it was replaced with the Crispy Chicken Deluxe, which was part of McDonald's ill-fated Deluxe line of sandwiches. But once again, the McChicken was brought back gradually towards the later months of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions. Additionally, in the United States, the sandwich is somewhat smaller than it was previously, as it is now on the \"Dollar Menu & More\" (previously just the Dollar Menu), which offers various food products starting at US$1.00.\n\nThe meat of the McChicken sandwich used to be 50% white meat and 50% dark meat. Viewed in April 2015, McDonald's website states that the McChicken contains a blend of dark and white meat chicken.\n\nIn certain regions and at specific McDonald's franchises, the McChicken is adapted to appeal to the local population's tastes.\n\nWhen the McChicken was reintroduced to McDonald's menu in mid-to-late 1997 as a smaller sandwich, it was initially marketed as the Cajun (Style) McChicken. The name was changed back to just McChicken around 2001, alongside the change to a milder, softer chicken patty.\n\nIn the south and southwestern parts of the US, the Hot 'n Spicy variant is sold. It originated as a nationwide menu item in January 2006, but by June of that year, McDonald's confirmed it had been discontinued due to slow sales. In March 2013, McDonald's re-introduced the Hot 'n Spicy across the country to what was then called the Dollar Menu. In November 2013, as part of the chain's Dollar Menu & More revamp, the McChicken (and the Hot 'n Spicy) could be ordered as a Buffalo Ranch McChicken, which is a McChicken with Buffalo and Ranch sauce instead of mayonnaise, or a Bacon Buffalo Ranch, which is a Buffalo Ranch McChicken with bacon. As of June 2015, the \"Hot 'n Spicy\" is no longer available nationally.\n\nThe Jalapeño Cheddar McChicken, a McChicken with jalapeño peppers sauce and a slice of white cheddar cheese, was available in 2011 and 2012.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in Hong Kong, Singapore and India serve a McSpicy variant, with a larger, crispier patty with increased spiciness and flavor. The spicy variant is also available as the \"Double McSpicy\", which consists of two spicy chicken patties.\n\nOutlets in Taiwan serve the Hot n' Spicy variant, which is available on a traditional bread bun or a formed rice bun, while locations in Malaysia serve a variant similar to the McSpicy called the Spicy Chicken McDeluxe but with a cornmeal bun.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Ala Moana Shopping Center McDonald's sells the \"McTeriChicken\" variant, a McChicken with teriyaki (\"teri\") sauce. \"Teri\" is heavily used in Hawaii and has been added to various McDonald's sandwiches, such as the \"McTeri Burger\".\n\nIn other US states, there is also another variant of the McChicken Sandwich called the \"Cheddar Onion McChicken\", which is a McChicken with caramelized onions and a slice of white cheddar cheese, both on a toasted bun.\nIn most countries outside of the US (such as India), the McChicken comes on a sesame-seed bun and is not spicy. In Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia (where it originally appeared as a promotional menu item but, due to its popularity, became a full-time menu item) and New Zealand, the McChicken also comes on a sesame-seed bun but with lettuce and a seasoned mayonnaise sauce called \"McChicken Sauce\".\n\nIn the UK, the \"Junior Chicken\" is sold as the \"Mayo Chicken\".\n\nIn Canada, the low-priced chicken option is called the \"Junior Chicken\", which generally costs C$1.99 (as an offering on McDonald's Canada's \"Value Picks\" menu), but the sandwich is only lightly spiced. It is referred to as the cousin of the Canadian McChicken, which in turn is more akin to the US' Premium Crispy Chicken sandwich (though the latter is served on an artisan roll, instead of the sesame seed bun of its Canadian counterpart).\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in Spain serve a variant with barbecue sauce rather than mayonnaise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "977446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=977446", "title": "Gulab jamun", "text": "Gulab jamun\n\nGulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, popular in India, Nepal (where it is known as Lalmohan), Pakistan, and Bangladesh (where it is known as gulab jam), as well as Myanmar. It is also common in Mauritius, Fiji, southern and eastern Africa, Malay Peninsula, and the Caribbean countries of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and Jamaica. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from Khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried/powdered milk instead of Khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds to enhance flavour.\n\nIn India, milk solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame for a long time until most of the water content has evaporated. These milk solids, known as \"khoya\" in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, are kneaded into a dough, with a small amount of flour (maida), and then shaped into small balls and deep-fried at a low temperature of about 148 °C. The balls are then soaked in a light sugary syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.\n\nGulab jamun was first prepared in medieval India, derived from a fritter that Central Asian Turkic invaders brought to India. One theory claims that it was accidentally prepared by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's personal chef.\n\nThe word \"gulab\" is derived from the Persian words \"gol\" (flower) and \"āb\" (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup. \"Jamun\" or \"jaman\" is the Hindi-Urdu word for \"Syzygium jambolanum\", an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum. Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup. The Arab dessert \"luqmat al-qadi\" is similar to gulab jamun, although it uses a different batter. According to the culinary historian Michael Krondl, both luqmat al-qadi and gulab jamun may have derived from a Persian dish, with rose water syrup being a common connection between the two.\n\n\"Gulab jamun\" is a dessert often eaten at festivals, birthdays or major celebrations such as marriages, the Muslim celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Hindu festival of Diwali (the Indian festival of light). There are various types of \"gulab jamun\" and every variety has a distinct taste and appearance.\n\n\"Gulab jamun\" gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (\"khoya\"). In other types of \"gulab jamun\", sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called \"kala jam\" or \"black jam\". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a \"gulab jamun\".\n\nHomemade \"gulab jamun\" is usually made up of powdered milk, a pinch of all-purpose flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup.\n\nPantua is similar to \"gulab jamun\", and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish. Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of \"gulab jamun\". It is said to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856-62.\n\nIn central India, Gulab Jamun is termed rasgulla. Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for \"Jhurre Ka Rasgulla\", which has been made there for the past 100 years. It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.\n\nIn Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi.\n\n\ngulaabjaam ,Marathi feature film, 2018 .\n"}

Their unusual shape and thin candy-coating is comparable to rock candy. With their anthropomorphic covers, Nerds usually contain two flavors per box, and each flavor has a separate compartment and opening. Larger packages may contain various colors—sometimes referred to as \"Rainbow Nerds\". Smaller packages may contain either one flavor only, or one flavor with pieces of another.\n\nAngelo Fraggos launched the production of Nerds in 1983. By 1985, Nerds were recognized as \"Candy of the Year\" by the National Candy Wholesalers Association (NCWA). The United Kingdom sold a three-box chambered package of Nerds, with strawberry cola as one of the flavors. Throughout the years, the product has been sold in a box with compartments, each compartment containing a different flavor.\nThe television show Unwrapped explains how Nerds are made. A factory worker states, \"Basically we start off with a sugar crystal and we just keep coating it with more sugar.\" The factory spins huge barrel-like containers of sugar crystals, which receive coats of sugar until the Nerds are formed. Their original color is pure white; they receive their colors in separate barrels. Each barrel is then transferred into the different nerd boxes. For instance, strawberry and grape go together—the most famous flavor combination among Nerds in America.\n\nThe article \"Nerds Candy Nutrition\" states, \"Nerds primarily consist of sugar. The top three ingredients are dextrose, sugar and malic acid. The rest of the candy contains less than 2 percent of corn syrup, artificial flavors, carnauba wax and artificial coloring. The artificial coloring varies by flavor.\" The allergy warnings of this candy state that Nerds are created \"in a facility that also produces wheat and egg.\" The normal serving size is one tablespoon—about 15 grams. (One serving of Nerds is equivalent to 60 calories.) The Halloween hand-out size is typically 15 grams, and the larger boxes contain 141.7 grams. Nerds consist of neither fat nor protein; the main calories come from carbohydrates.\n\nNerds were a popular candy in the 1980s, but they had big competitors including Pop Rocks, Candy Buttons, and Mike and Ike’s. Nerds also had a close cousin in the '80s—Dweebs. Dweebs were very similar to Nerds; but they were less sour and bigger in size. One of the most popular differences is that Dweebs contained three flavors instead of two, though the United Kingdom had a box of nerds with three flavors for a limited time. According to Rob Bricken, \"A squishier Nerd with more leg space and a surprise in the middle, Dweebs were more substantial, less sour, and displayed a greater depth and complexity than Nerds.\" Dweebs only lasted a short time on the market, however.\n\nNerds consist of various flavors and colors, ranging from extremely sweet to extremely sour; often, the two flavours in one box will contrast, and a single flavor may even exhibit both extremes. They are thickly glazed with carnauba wax, which gives them a hard bite and a gloss. The nucleus of each candy is composed of one or more complete sucrose crystals. These optically clear monoclinic crystals are about 0.2–1 mm in length and help define the irregular shape.\nA Nerds breakfast cereal based on this concept appeared in the 1980s, but it had a short life.\nAlthough many other flavors are available, some of the current regular flavors of Nerds include the following:\n\nWilly Wonka has also come up with several spin-off products of Nerds:\n\n\"Valentine Nerds\", a mini box with Strawberry (pink) and Punch (White) flavors mixed. \n\nThroughout the 1980s, several new flavors of Nerds were introduced from time to time; for example, \"Hot and Cool\" Nerds (cinnamon & wintergreen flavored), Blueberry and Raspberry, and Lemon and Lime.\n\nAccording to Laurnie Wilson, \"Some say that [Nerds were] named after a reference in the Dr. Seuss Book, If I Ran the Zoo, where a 'nerd' is mentioned as one of the creatures the narrator would collect for his zoo.\" Wilson also mentions the invention of the now-discontinued Nerds cereal. He points out, however, that \"you can eat Nerds pretty much any other time of the day.\"\n\nA variety of Nerds products have been sold exclusively in the United Kingdom. Jason Liebig claims that \"back in 2005, Wonka’s UK arm released a product called Nerdalicious, which was sort of like Nerd-filled licorice.\"\n"}

Though there are variations from the original flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, nuts, and whole or diced marshmallows. According to one source, the flavor was created in March 1929 by William Dreyer in Oakland, California when he cut up walnuts and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream in a manner that reflected how his partner Joseph Edy's chocolate candy creation incorporated walnuts and marshmallow pieces. Later, the walnuts would be replaced by pieces of toasted almond. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dreyer and Edy gave the flavor its current name \"to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression.\" Alternatively, Fentons Creamery in Oakland claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road-style ice cream flavor invented by his friend, Fentons' George Farren, who blended his own Rocky Road-style candy bar into ice cream; however, Dreyer substituted almonds for walnuts.\n\nThe original Rocky Road ice cream used chocolate ice cream with no chocolate chip pieces.\n\n\n"}

Its popularity then spread up and down the Connecticut coast, but not far beyond it. In Connecticut, the sandwich served warm is a \"lobster roll\", cold a \"lobster salad roll\".\n\nAs far back as 1970, chopped lobster meat heated in drawn butter was served on a hot dog bun at road side stands such as Red's Eats in Maine. Lobster rolls in the U.S. are associated with the state of Maine, but are also commonly available at seafood restaurants in the other New England states and on Eastern Long Island, where lobster fishing is common.\n\nLobster rolls in Maine are characteristically served on a New England-style hot dog bun, which is split on the top instead of the side and has flat sides for grilling. The lobster meat is usually served cold, rather than warm or hot, and mayonnaise is typically spread inside the bun or tossed with the meat. The filling consists of chunked knuckle, claw, and lobster tail, and only lightly seasoned if at all, and is otherwise plain. Four ounces is a standard serving size.\n\nLobster rolls are a staple summer meal throughout the Maritime provinces in Canada, particularly Nova Scotia where they may also appear on hamburger buns, baguettes, or other types of bread rolls and even pita pockets. The traditional sides are potato chips and dill pickles.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants in Canadian provinces, such as Nova Scotia and Ontario, as well as in New England, offer lobster rolls as a limited edition item in the summer.\n\nIn July 2017, Down East Magazine held their inaugural \"World’s Best Lobster Roll\" competition, selecting Freshies Lobster in Park City, Utah as its winner.

In other words, the measurements are taken by a single person or instrument on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time. A less-than-perfect test–retest reliability causes test–retest variability. Such variability can be caused by, for example, intra-individual variability and intra-observer variability. A measurement may be said to be \"repeatable\" when this variation is smaller than a pre-determined acceptance criterion.\n\nTest–retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined \"critical difference\", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments.\n\nThe following conditions need to be fulfilled in the establishment of repeatability: \n\nRepeatability methods were developed by Bland and Altman (1986).\n\nIf the correlation between separate administrations of the test is high (e.g. 0.7 or higher as in this Cronbach's alpha-internal consistency-table), then it has good test–retest reliability.\n\nThe repeatability coefficient is a precision measure which represents the value below which the absolute difference between two repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%.\n\nThe standard deviation under repeatability conditions is part of precision and accuracy.\n\nAn attribute agreement analysis is designed to simultaneously evaluate the impact of repeatability and reproducibility on accuracy. It allows the analyst to examine the responses from multiple reviewers as they look at several scenarios multiple times. It produces statistics that evaluate the ability of the appraisers to agree with themselves (repeatability), with each other (reproducibility), and with a known master or correct value (overall accuracy) for each characteristic – over and over again.\n\nBecause the same test is administered twice and every test is parallel with itself, differences between scores on the test and scores on the retest should be due solely to measurement error. This sort of argument is quite probably true for many physical measurements. However, this argument is often inappropriate for psychological measurement, because it is often impossible to consider the second administration of a test a parallel measure to the first.\n\nThe second administration of a psychological test might yield systematically different scores than the first administration due to the following reasons:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "989813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=989813", "title": "Epiousios", "text": "Epiousios\n\nThe word epiousios (ἐπιούσιος) is the non-inflected form of epiousion (ἐπιούσιον), a \"hapax legomenon\" found only in the Lord's Prayer as reported in the New Testament passages and . As a \"hapax\", its interpretation relies upon morphological analysis and context. It is an adjective modifying \"artos\" (), the word for bread.\n\nBy tradition, the most common English language translation is \"daily\", although most scholars today reject this. All other New Testament passages with the translation \"daily\" include the word \"hemeran\" (ἡμέρᾱν, 'day'). \n\nThe difficulty in understanding \"epiousios\" goes at least as far back as AD 382. At that time, St. Jerome was commissioned by Pope Damasus I to renew and consolidate the various collections of biblical texts in the \"Vetus Latina\" (\"Old Latin\") then in use by the Church. Jerome accomplished this by going back to the original Greek of the New Testament and translating it into Latin; his translation came to be known as the \"Vulgate\". In the identical contexts of Matthew and Luke—that is, reporting the Lord's Prayer—Jerome translated \"epiousios\" in two different ways: by morphological analysis as 'supersubstantial' (\"supersubstantialem\") in Matthew 6:11, but retaining 'daily' (\"quotidianum\") in Luke 11:3. \n\nThe modern Catholic Catechism holds that there are several ways of understanding \"epiousios\", including the traditional 'daily', but most literally as 'supersubstantial' or 'superessential', based on its morphological components. Alternative theories are that—aside from the etymology of \"ousia\", meaning 'substance'—it may be derived from either of the verbs \"einai\" (εἶναι), meaning \"to be\", or \"ienai\" (ἰέναι), meaning both \"to come\" and \"to go\".\n\nAccording to the Catholic theologian Brant Pitre, a \"for the future'\" interpretation is \"remarkably...now held by a majority of scholars,\" but that \"the primary weakness of this view is its lack of support among ancient Christian interpreters, whose command of Greek was surely as good if not better than that of modern scholars.\" He further states that 'supernatural' \"translates (epiousios) as it stands as literally as possible.\" Moreover, \"among ancient authors, the \"supernatural\" interpretation finds remarkably wide support, which strangely often goes unmentioned by modern studies.\" Pope Benedict XVI in his analysis wrote similarly on the same topic, stating \"the fact is that the Fathers of the Church were practically unanimous in understanding the fourth petition of the Our Father (Lord's Prayer) as a Eucharistic petition.\"\n\nThe word is visible in the Hanna Papyrus 1 (p)—\"Mater Verbi\" (\"Mother of the Word\"), the oldest surviving witness for certain New Testament passages. \n\n\"Epiousion\" is the only adjective in the Lord's Prayer. It is masculine, accusative, singular, agreeing in gender, number, and case with the noun it qualifies, , \"arton\". In an interlinear gloss:\n\nAccording to the \"Novum Testamentum Graece\", a compendium source document for most current New Testament translations and a standard for related academic work, the word appears only in Matthew 6:11 and Luke 11:2 as part of the Lord's Prayer. This makes \"epiousios\" a \"hapax legomenon\", that is, it appears only once. \"The Didache\", a first- or early second-century guide to Christian discipleship, also quotes ἐπιούσιος verbatim from the Lord's Prayer (Matthew's wording) in 8:2. \n\nIn the twentieth century, one other use appeared to come to light. In an Egyptian papyrus dated to the 5th century CE, a shopping list, Sammelbuch 5224,20, a word transcribed as \"epiousios\" appears next to the names of several grocery items. This seems to indicate that it was used in the sense of \"enough for today\", \"enough for tomorrow\", or \"necessary\". However, after the papyrus containing the shopping list, missing for many years, was rediscovered at the Yale Beinecke Library in 1998, a re-examination found \"elaiou\" (oil), not \"epiousios.\" (The original transcriber, A. H. Sayce, was apparently known to be a poor transcriber.) In addition, the document was reassessed to date from the first or second century CE, not the 5th century. Therefore, the use of \"epiousios\" seems indeed to occur nowhere else in ancient Greek literature besides Matthew, Luke, and \"The Didachē\". \"Epiousei\", used in Acts 7:26 to refer to the \"next\" day, may be a cognate word.\n\nThere are several reasons that \"epiousios\" presents an exceptional translation challenge. The word appears nowhere else in other Ancient Greek texts, and so may have been coined by the authors of the Gospel. Jesus probably did not originally compose the prayer in Greek, but in his native language (either Aramaic language or Hebrew), but the consensus view is that the New Testament was originally written in Koine Greek. This implies the probability of language interpretation (i.e., spoken Aramaic to written Greek) at the outset of recording the Gospel. Thus, the meaning of any such word is often difficult to determine, because cross-references and comparisons with other usages are not possible, except by morphological analysis.\n\nTo sum up, both modern and ancient scholars have proposed several different translations for \"epiousios\". Even Jerome, the most important translator of the Bible to Latin, translated this same word in the same context in two different ways. Today there is no consensus on the exact meaning. What follows is a review of the alternative translations.\n\n\"Daily\" has long been the most common English translation of \"epiousios\". It is the term used in the Tyndale Bible, the King James Version, and in the most popular modern English versions. This rests on the analysis of \"epi\" as \"for\" and \"ousia\" as \"being\"; the word would mean \"for the [day] being\" with \"day\" being implicit.\n\nThis version is based on the Latin rendering of \"epiousios\" as \"quotidianum\", rather than the alternative Latin translation of \"supersubstantialem\". This \"quotidianum\" interpretation is first recorded in the works of Tertullian. This was used in the Vetus Latina, a collective term for various \"Old Latin\" Bible translations prior to Jerome's Vulgate.\n\nThe Vulgate is a late fourth-century Latin translation of the Bible from its original languages, and was largely the work of St. Jerome, who was commissioned by Pope Damasus I in the year 382 to revise the \"Vetus Latina\". In Luke 11:3, Jerome rendered \"epiousios\", via what had become at that point tradition, as \"quotidianum\", and yet in Matthew 6:11 he also rendered \"epiousios\" as \"supersubstantialem\" from its morphological components. The \"quotidianum\" translation remains in the Latin text of the Roman Catholic Mass, even though the same liturgy mainly references the Gospel of Matthew, which uses \"supersubstantialem\" for translating \"epiousios\".\n\nSome translators have proposed slight variations on \"daily\" as the most accurate. Richard Francis Weymouth, an English schoolmaster, translated it as \"bread for today\" in the Weymouth New Testament. Edgar J. Goodspeed in An American Translation used \"bread for the day.\" Another option is to view \"epiousios\" as an allusion to Exodus 16:4 where God promises to provide a day's portion of manna every day. This verse could be an attempt to translate the Hebrew of \"bread sufficient to the day\" into Greek.\n\nToday, most scholars reject the translation of \"epiousios\" as meaning \"daily\". The word \"daily\" only has a weak connection to any proposed etymologies for \"epiousios\". Moreover, all other New Testament chapter and verse translations of scripture from their original Greek phrase into \"daily\" otherwise reference \"hemeran\" (ἡμέραν, \"the day\"), which does not appear in this usage. Because there are several other Greek words based on \"hemera\" that mean \"daily\", no reason is apparent to use such an obscure word as \"epiousios\". The \"daily\" translation also makes the term redundant, with \"this day\" already making clear the bread is for the current day.\n\nIn the Vulgate Jerome translated \"epiousios\" in Matthew 6:11 as \"supersubstantial\", coining a new word not before seen in Latin. This came from the analysis of the prefix \"epi-\" as super and \"ousia\" in the sense of substance. The Catholic Church believes that this, or \"superessential\", is the most literal English translation via Latin, which lacks a grammatical form for \"being\", the literal translation of the Greek \"ousia\", and so substance or essence are used instead. \n\nThis interpretation was supported by early writers such as Augustine, Cyril of Jerusalem, Cyprian of Carthage and John Cassian.\n\nThis translation is used by some modern Bibles. In the Douay-Rheims Bible English translation of the Vulgate () reads \"give us this day our supersubstantial bread.\" The translation of \"supersubstantial bread\" has also been associated with the eucharist, as early as in the time of the Church Fathers and later also by the Council of Trent (1551).\n\nIn 1979, the \"Nova Vulgata\" (\"Nova Vulgata Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio\"), also called the Neo-Vulgate, became the official Latin edition of the Bible published by the Holy See for use in the contemporary Roman rite. It is not an edition of the historical Vulgate, but a revision of the text intended to accord with modern critical Hebrew and Greek texts and produce a style closer to classical Latin. The \"Nova Vulgata\" retains the same correspondence-of-meaning for \"epiousios\" in the Lord's Prayer contained in the Gospel according to Matthew and Luke as in the Vulgate, i.e., \"supersubstantialem\" and \"quotidianum\".\n\nToday, the Roman Catholic Church instructs its faithful via the Catechism of the Catholic Church that there are several meanings to \"epiousios\", and that \"epi-ousios\" is most literally translated as \"super-essential\":\n\n\"\"Daily\" (\"epiousios\") occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of \"this day,\" to confirm us in trust \"without reservation.\" Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence. Taken literally (epi-ousios: \"super-essential\"), it refers directly to the Bread of Life, the Body of Christ, the \"medicine of immortality,\" without which we have no life within us. Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is evident: \"this day\" is the Day of the Lord, the day of the feast of the kingdom, anticipated in the Eucharist that is already the foretaste of the kingdom to come. For this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic liturgy to be celebrated each day.\"\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the Magisterium is the authority to lay down what is the authentic teaching of the Church, which since Pius XII's \"Divino afflante Spiritu\" has included embracing Biblical Criticism.\n\nThe Old Church Slavonic canon translates \"epiousios\" variously as (\"nasǫštĭnŭì\", ‘supersubstantial’) or (\"nastavŭšaago dĭne\", ‘for the coming day’).\n\nThis translation has often been connected to the eucharist. The bread necessary for existence is the communion bread of the Last Supper. That the gospel writers needed to create a new word indicates to Eugene LaVerdiere, the late Catholic American priest and Scripture scholar of the post-Vatican II era, that they are describing something new. Eating the communion bread at the Last Supper created the need for a new word for this new concept.\n\n\"Supersubstantial\" was the dominant Latin translation of \"epiousios\" from Matthew for many centuries after Jerome, and influenced church ritual. It was the basis for the argument advanced by theologians such as Cyprian that communion must be eaten daily. That only bread is mentioned led to the practice of giving the laity only the bread and not the wine of the Eucharist. This verse was cited in arguments against the Utraquists. The translation was reconsidered with the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther originally kept \"supersubstantial\" but switched to \"daily\" by 1528.\n\nBrant Pitre, a Catholic theologian at Notre Dame Seminary, observes that the \"supernatural\" translation for \"epiousios\" \"despite being widely held among ancient Christians, receives virtually no support among modern exegetes...despite the fact that it is easily the most literal translation.\"\nThose rejecting this translation include some Roman Catholic Biblical scholars, such as Raymond E. Brown, Jean Carmignac, Leonardo Boff and Nicholas Ayo.\n\nThere is no known source word from Aramaic or Hebrew, the native languages of Jesus, that translates into the Greek word \"epiousios\". In fact, there is no word in either of these languages that easily translates as \"supersubstantial\", a unique translation for a unique Greek word. Catholic theologican Leonardo Boff once stated that Jerome's translation of \"epi-\" as \"super\" was incorrect, as he asserted that it should be translated as \"concerning\" as can be seen in words such as \"epinephes\" (cloudy) and \"epidorpios\" (stewed).\n\nM. Eugene Boring, a Protestant theologian at Texas Christian University, claims that the connection with the Eucharist is ahistoric because he thinks that the ritual only developed some time after the Gospel was written and that the author of Matthew does not seem to have any knowledge of or interest in the Eucharist. Craig Blomberg, also a Protestant New Testament scholar, agrees that these \"concepts had yet to be introduced when Jesus gave his original prayer and therefore could not have been part of his original meaning.\"\n\nAnother interpretation is to link \"epiousios\" to the Greek word \"ousia\" meaning both the verb \"to be\" and the noun \"substance.\" Origen was the first writer to comment on the unusual word. A native Greek speaker writing a century and half after the Gospels were composed, he did not recognize the word and thought it was an original neologism. Origen thought \"bread necessary for existence\" was the most likely meaning, connecting it to the \"to be\" translation of \"ousia\". \n\nPhilosopher Raïssa Maritain, wife of philosopher Jacques Maritain, comments that during her era of the 1940s this translation was found to be the most acceptable by modern scholars. Her own conclusion was stated as being in agreement with Theodore of Mopsuestia, that being the \"bread we need.\" This was seen as vague enough to cover what was viewed as the three possible etymological meanings: (1) literal - the \"bread of tomorrow or the bread of the present day,\" (2) analogical - the \"bread we need in order to subsist,\" and (3) spiritual/mystical - the bread \"which is above our substance\" (i.e., supersubstantial). \n\nJoseph Fitzmyer translates the verse as \"give us this day our bread for subsistence.\" He connects this to the Aramaic targum translations of Proverbs 30:8.\n\nOne problem with the \"epi\" + \"ousia\" theory is it does not follow the standard Greek form of building compound words. Usually the iota at the end of \"epi\" would be dropped in the compound. This is not an absolute rule, however: Jean Carmignac has collected 26 compound words that violate it. Like \"daily\", this translation also has the problem that there are well known Greek words that could have been used instead.\n\nThe \"for the future\" etymology is weak, and most ancient interpreters of this scripture do not support such an interpretation. Early supporters of this translation include Cyril of Alexandria and Peter of Laodicea by way of linking \"epiousios\" with the verb \"epienai\", \"of tomorrow.\" According to Jewish theologian Herbert Basser, this translation was also considered (but eventually rejected) as a possibility by Jerome, who noted it as an aside in his commentary to Matthew that the Gospel of the Hebrews used \"ma[h]ar\" (\"for tomorrow\") in this verse. \n\nWithout specific reference, Raymond E. Brown claims it is also indicated by early Bohairic and Sahidic sources. Referencing \"epiousei\" in Acts 7:26, the Lutheran theologian Albert Schweitzer, reintroduced this translation in modern times. A \"for the future\" reading leads to a cluster of related translations, including: \"bread for tomorrow,\" \"bread for the future,\" and \"bread for the coming day.\" \n\nBeyond the literal meaning, this translation can also be read in an eschatological context: \"the petition for an anticipation of the world to come.\" Others see \"tomorrow\" being referenced to the end times and the bread that of the messianic feast. Raymond Brown argues that all the other phrases of the Lord's Prayer are eschatological, so it would be incongruous for this phrase to be speaking prosaically about bread for eating. Eduard Schweizer, a Swiss New Testament scholar and theologian, disagrees. Humble bread was not traditionally presented as part of the messianic feast and the prosaic need for bread to survive would have been a universal sentiment of Jesus' followers.\n\nThe enigma of \"epiousios\" continues, however, as several logical and linguistic flaws exist in the analysis as being \"for the future.\" Alongside the weak etymology regarding \"epienai\", a \"for the future\" interpretation was rarely considered as proper by early writers, who are presumed to have had far more knowledge of Koiné Greek knowledge than any modern scholar. Also substantially undercutting the \"for the future\" interpretation, an adjectival form for \"tomorrow\" exists in ancient Greek, e.g., \"αὔριον\" in Matthew 6:34, and could easily have been used instead of the one-time-use \"ἐπιούσιον\". \n\nYet another problem with a \"for the future\" translation is it also seems to contradict , where only a few verses later Jesus tells his followers not to worry about food, that God will take care of such needs. W.D. Davies, a Welsh Congregationalist scholar, and Dale Allison, an American New Testament scholar, however, don't see a contradiction. tells one not to be anxious about such needs. That a pious person asks God in prayer for these needs to be filled, may rather be why there is no need to worry.\n\nKenneth E. Bailey, a professor of theology and linguistics, proposed \"give us today the bread that doesn't run out\" as the correct translation. The Syriac versions of the Bible were some of the first translations of the Gospels from the Greek into another language. Syriac is also close to Jesus' own Aramaic, and the translators close in time and language to Jesus should thus have had considerable insight into his original meanings. In Syriac \"epiousios\" is translated as \"anemo\", meaning lasting or perpetual.\n\nLutheran scholar Douglas E. Oakman suggests \"give us today bread in abundance\" as another translation. He notes that in the contemporary literature \"ousia\" can mean substance, but it also has a concrete meaning of a large, substantial, estate. Thus as a cognate of the word \"periousiois\", \"epiousios\" could refer to plentiful or abundant bread.\n\nOakman also notes contemporary sources that translate \"ousia\" as the royal or imperial estate and proposes that the verse could originally have meant \"give us the royal bread ration for today.\"\n\nDavies and Allison state that the verse has also been translated as \"give us this day the bread that belongs to it,\" though they concede that this expression is little recognized by modern scholars.\n\n\n"}

They are often served with oyster stew. They are similar in ingredients and flavor to saltine crackers.\n\nOyster crackers are popular in the northeastern United States, where they are served as an accompaniment to soup, and in the Cincinnati area, where they are frequently served with the city's distinctive chili. In New England, oyster crackers are served in oyster stew and chowders. Additionally, plain oyster crackers are sometimes seasoned with spices. They usually have a taste similar to saltine crackers, but far less salty. In other areas of the United States, they are among the choices for crackers with soup. They are often available in single serving packages for restaurant use.\n\nMany different companies produce oyster crackers with different combinations of shortenings and other ingredients, but retaining the same general shape and size.\n\nThe origin of the term \"oyster cracker\" is unclear, but it may be that they were originally served with oyster stew or clam chowder or merely that they look like an oyster in its shell. Other names include \"water cracker,\" \"Philadelphia cracker,\" and \"Trenton cracker\".\n\nThe Westminster Cracker Company of Rutland, Vermont, has been making oyster crackers since 1828. However, a counterclaim is that Adam Exton is credited with inventing the oyster cracker.\n\nAdam Exton, a baker in Trenton, New Jersey, emigrated to America from Lancashire, England, in 1842. In Trenton, Exton opened a cake and cracker bakery with his brother-in-law, Richard Aspden, in 1846. Although Aspden died the following year, Exton continued with the bakery (the \"Exton Cracker Bakery\" or \"Adam Exton & Co.\"). He invented a machine that rolled and docked pastry and solved the sanitary problems of hand-rolling crackers.\n\nThe history of the oyster cracker was related by Exton's nephew, also named Adam Exton, in the \"Trenton Evening Times\" newspaper on May 31, 1917:\n\n"}

Miombo woodland is classified in the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (in the World Wide Fund for Nature scheme). The biome includes four woodland savanna ecoregions (listed below) characterized by the predominant presence of miombo species, with a range of climates from humid to semi-arid, and tropical to subtropical or even temperate.\n\nCharacteristically the trees shed their leaves for a short period in the dry season to reduce water loss, and produce a flush of new leaves just before the onset of the rainy season with rich gold and red colours masking the underlying chlorophyll, reminiscent of temperate autumn colours. \n\nThe name miombo is used in a number of Bantu languages in the region such as Swahili, Shona and Bemba. In Bemba, the word \"miombo\" is the plural of the word \"muombo\", which is the specific name for the species \"Brachystegia longifolia\".\n\nMiombo woodlands form a broad belt across south-central Africa, running from Angola in the west to Tanzania to the east. These woodlands are dominated by trees of subfamily Caesalpinioideae, particularly miombo (\"Brachystegia\"), \"Julbernardia\" and \"Isoberlinia\", which are rarely found outside miombo woodlands.

The predominant tree is miombo (\"Brachystegia\" spp.).

The term is most commonly used to refer to meats coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried, but some variants such as Walliser Schnitzel are not breaded. Originating in Austria, the breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and made using either chicken, veal, mutton, beef, turkey, or pork. It is very similar to the French dish escalope, tonkatsu in Japan, and the milanesa of Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThe German word \"Schnitzel\", Middle High German \"Snitzel\", is a diminutive of \"Sniz\" 'slice'. The term \"Wiener Schnitzel\" itself dates to at least 1845.\n\nThe dish called is a popular part of Viennese cuisine. It is made of veal and is traditionally garnished with a slice of lemon and either potato salad or potatoes with parsley and butter.\n\nThe term is a protected geographical indication in Austria and Germany and can only be made of veal. When any other kind of meat is used, the dish must be called (\"Viennese Schnitzel of pig/turkey/chicken\") or (\"Schnitzel Viennese style\") to differentiate it from the veal original.\n\nThe English term schnitzel means in general all types of breaded, fried flat pieces of meat. Due to the similarity between schnitzel and escalope, in many of the countries listed below, people sometimes refer to schnitzels as escalope, and vice versa.\n\nIn Latin American countries, this dish is called \"milanesa\".\n\nBeef (which may be veal) and chicken schnitzel are both very popular dishes in Australia, particularly in pubs where they are among the most widely available meals. Chicken schnitzel (less so beef) is also sold at many take-away establishments.\n\nSchnitzel in Australia is often served in the form of parmigiana, which is a schnitzel topped with Italian tomato sauce, cheese, and occasionally ham.\n\nAt pubs, schnitzel is typically accompanied by chips (French fries), salad, and sometimes bacon. Plain and parmigiana schnitzels are sometimes respectively known by colloquial names \"Schnitty\", \"Schnitter\", and \"Parma\" or \"Parmie\".\n\nWiener Schnitzel, a very thin, breaded and pan fried cutlet made from veal, is one of the best known specialities of Viennese cuisine, and is one of the national dishes of Austria.\n\nOther popular unbreaded variants in Austria are:\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the dish is called \"Bečka Šnicla\" or \"Bečki Odrezak\" (\"Bečki\" = \"Viennese\"; Šnicla = transliteration of German \"Schnitzel\") and is made of veal or beef and usually served with mashed potatoes. Common garnishes include a slice of lemon or some lettuce.\n\nIn Brazil, such preparations, designated \"à milanesa\" (Milanese-style), are quite common, especially in the more European-influenced southern region of the country. The meats of choice are beef or chicken, while veal and pork are relatively rare.\n\nCalled шницел (\"shnitsel\"), it is made from ground veal, formed as a thin patty, seasoned with salt and black pepper, then breaded and fried. The dish usually is served with a choice of mashed or roasted potatoes, French fries, or simply a tomato salad.\nIt is common at truck stops, and it is usually ordered \"à la carte\", coming with a lemon wedge, but one can also find it in the frozen sections in supermarkets or premade and ready to cook.\n\n\"Schnitzel\" presentations are called \"chuleta\" in Colombia. They are composed of flat pieces of chicken, veal, or mostly pork, covered with flour, and then deep-fried. The \"chuleta\" is a traditional dish of the Valle del Cauca region.\n\nIn Croatia, the dish is called \"Bečki odrezak\" (\"šnicl\") (Bečki = \"Viennese\";\" šnicl\" = transliteration of German \"Schnitzel\") and it is made of pork and served with French fries. Common garnishes include a slice of lemon or some lettuce. A similar dish is called \"Zagrebački odrezak\" (\"šnicl\") (a variation on cordon bleu).\n\n\"Schnitzel\" is also very popular in the Czech Republic, where it is known as a \"smažený řízek\" or just \"řízek\", and is made of pork, chicken, or veal. It is often served with boiled or mashed potatoes or potato salad. It also used to be and to some degree still is a typical packed lunch for day trips, when it was consumed with bread (often between two slices of bread as a sandwich). During the communist period, a deep-fried breaded hard cheese called \"smažený sýr\" (literally, \"fried cheese\") became popular, mainly among the youth and students, especially served with tartar sauce, a slice of lemon, and boiled new potatoes with melted butter and parsley greens.\n\nIn Denmark, the dish is called \"skinkeschnitzel\" when made of pork and \"wienerschnitzel\" when made of veal, and is usually served with fried potatoes, gravy, green or snow peas, and a \"boy\" (\"dreng\" in Danish) consisting of a lemon slice topped with capers, horseradish, and a slice of anchovy.\n\nIn Finland, the dish called \"Wieninleike\" (\"Viennese cutlet\"), is almost always made of pork, breaded and fried like the original. It is usually served with French fries, potato mash, or wedge potatoes. A slice of lemon, a slice of anchovy, and a few capers are placed on top of the cutlet. Usually, the dish also includes a small amount of salad made from fresh vegetables. The dish was extremely popular between the end of the Second World War and the 1990s, when it could be found in virtually any low-end restaurant across Finland. In the past decades, its popularity has been dimmed by the rise of fast food.\n\nHowever Wieninleike and its different variations remain a staple of menus in virtually any non-ethnic or fine dining restaurant in Finland. Lunch restaurants, different highway resting places and restaurants attached to gas stations are most prominently associated with this type of menu in Finland.\n\n\nTypically all dishes above are prepared out of pork.\n\n\"Pariser schnitzel\" is similar to Wiener Schnitzel but is floured and fried in an egg batter instead of using breadcrumbs.\n\nIn Germany, the term \"Schnitzel\" means cutlets in general, not just breaded, fried ones.\n\nDue to the strong Austrian influence of the Austro-Hungarian era, \"Wiener schnitzel\" is very popular in Hungary, known as \"bécsi szelet\" (Viennese slice), \"borjú bécsi\" (Viennese veal) or \"rántott hús\" (breaded meat). It is served in restaurants, and is a common meal in Hungarian homes, prepared often on Sundays or for festivities with \"spätzle\", French fries, mashed potatoes, or rice. Alternatively, green peas or other vegetables can be used as side dish. Bread and salad (or pickles) often accompany the meal. Some restaurants offer the \"cordon bleu\" variant, a slice of schnitzel rolled and filled with cheese and ham.\n\nSchnitzel is popular in Iran, where it is known as \"shenitsel\" (). Thought to have been introduced in Persia during the World Wars, \"shenitsel\" is usually thicker, bigger, spicier, and fried with a more crispy breading than the standard schnitzel. It is customarily served with lemon, French fries, and a variety of boiled vegetables.\n\nAnother Iranian dish, \"kotlet\" (), should not be confused with \"shenitsel\". They are small, oval-shaped patties made by deep-frying a mix of ground meat, onion, potato, and herbs.\n\nIn Israel the dish is called \"Schnitzel\" (, \"shnitsel\"). It is a very popular food in Israeli cuisine. The meat is typically chicken or turkey breast, in conformance with dietary kashrut laws, which do not allow pork to be used. Additionally, clarified butter, the preferred cooking fat for Austrian \"Wiener Schnitzel\", is impermissible for kosher use, as it is a dairy product forbidden from use with meat; vegetable oils are therefore preferred. Before frying, the schnitzel is coated with a mixture of beaten eggs and bread crumbs, sometimes spiced with paprika or sesame seeds. The Israeli schnitzel is usually served with mashed potatoes, French fries, rice, or pasta, accompanied by ketchup, hummus, or vegetable salad.\n\nThe schnitzel tradition was brought to Israel by Ashkenazi Jews coming from Europe, among them some of German origin. During the early years of the state of Israel, veal was not obtainable, and chicken or turkey proved to be inexpensive and tasty substitutes. Packaged schnitzels are widely available from the frozen food section in most supermarkets. Some frozen schnitzels are breaded patties made from processed chicken or turkey meat, not whole poultry breasts.\n\nSchnitzel is also sold inside a pita, alongside hummus, French fries and vegetable salad, in a similar way to falafel. Many falafel stands also offer a schnitzel in a pita.\n\nJapanese consists of a flattened pork loin, lightly seasoned, coated in flour, dipped in beaten egg, coated with \"panko\" crumbs and finally deep fried. \"Tonkatsu\" is often served as an accompaniment to \"ramen\" or \"udon\" or featured with curry and rice.\n\nPork tonkatsu was invented in Japan in 1899 at a restaurant called Rengatei in Tokyo. It was originally considered a type of \"yōshoku\"—Japanese versions of European cuisine invented in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—and was called \"katsuretsu\" (cutlet) or simply \"katsu\".\nVariations include the use of pork fillet (\"hirekatsu\"), chicken (\"chicken katsu\"), beef (\"gyūkatsu\"), ham (\"hamukatsu\") and minced meat (\"menchi-katsu\").\nIn Korean cuisine, pork (\"donkaseu\", from Japanese \"tonkatsu\"), chicken (\"chikinkaseu\"), and beef (\"bipkaseu\") cutlets are popular. The most common types of donkaseu are \"kyeongyangsik\"(경양식; Western-style) and \"ilbonsik\"(일본식; Japanese-style).\n\nIn the Republic of North Macedonia, the dish called шницла (\"shnitzla\") is a piece of pork seasoned with salt and black pepper, breaded and fried. Typically, it is served with mashed or fried potatoes with green salad garnish.\n\nIn Mexico, this dish, called \"milanesa\" or \"carne empanizada\", consists of a thin slice of beef, chicken, veal, or sometimes pork, and even eggplant or soy. Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other ingredients according to the cook's taste (like parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow-fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative.\n\nSchnitzel, both chicken and pork, is common in Namibia due to the German colonial history. A majority of the restaurants in Windhoek, Walvis Bay, and Swakopmund offer it on their menus, often topped with a fried egg and accompanied by potato salad. It is often eaten in a \"Brötchen \"(German sandwich roll) with tomatoes, cheese, and other dressing.\n\nIn the Netherlands (and Belgium) schnitzel is mostly made of pork and served with fries and vegetable salad. \"Zigeunerschnitzel\" (served with paprika) and \"Cordon bleu\" (Blue ribbon) are very popular. A typical Dutch variant is the 'gehaktschnitzel', a schnitzel made of minced meat. In the Netherlands every butcher has his own variants.\n\n\"Kotlet schabowy\" is a classical and most popular recipe for boneless pork chop or pork tenderloin. It can also be made from chicken.\n\nIn Portugal, schnitzel is called \"bife panado\" or just \"panado\" (\"breaded\"). Different varieties of\" panado \"can be made with chicken (\"panado de frango\"), turkey (\"panado de peru\"), pork (\"costeleta panada\" for pork chop, \"febra panada\" for pork without bone), or veal (\"escalope de vitela panado\"). The meat is usually seasoned with black pepper, garlic, and lemon juice. It is commonly served with spaghetti, fried potatoes, or rice (plain or with beans). It is also popular as a sandwich, served in a bun with lettuce (\"sandes de panado\").\n\nRomanian \"șnițel\" () is very common in restaurants, fast-food places, and homes across the country. Normally served simple and unadorned, the fast food version is differentiated by being served sandwich/burger style. \"Cordon bleu șnițel\" (made from pork loin stuffed with cheese and ham) is also very popular.\nThe Romanian \"șnițel\" is made in the same manner as the Austrian one, but as a local characteristic is made of almost any type of meat (chicken, pork, veal or beef).\n\nA specialty from western Romania is the \"mosaic șnițel\" made of two thin meat layers (usually each layer of different meat) and a vegetable (usually mushroom) filling. Also a recipe for \"șnițel de ciuperci,\" a mushroom fritter, is common.\n\nIn Russia, the dish is called отбивная (\"otbivnaya\"), which literally means a piece of meat that has been beaten. Russian cuisine includes recipes of schnitzel prepared from pork, as well as beef, veal, and chicken.\n\nIn Serbia, the dish is called \"bečka šnicla\" (Viennese schnitzel). A local urban legend states the dish originated in Serbia and not in Austria, but no one can say why.\nIn Serbia, word Schnitzel is used to describe for any cutlet, not just breaded meat.\n\nSchnitzel is highly popular in Slovakia, a country bordering Austria, where it is referred to as \"vyprážaný rezeň\". or simply \"rezeň\" (in the Western parts colloquially also \"schnitzel\"). It is often made of pork or chicken, and is typically served with fried potatoes (not peeled), boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, fries (especially in canteens), potato salad, or rice.\n\nSchnitzel is called \"dunajski zrezek\", meaning Viennese-style cutlets (Vienna is \"Dunaj\" in Slovenian). It is served with sauerkraut and boiled potatoes. Restaurants serving the dish can be found throughout the country, though typically it is made of pork or chicken. In Slovenia, a similar dish is called \"ljubljanski zrezek\" (after Ljubljana, the country's capital).\n\nSchnitzels are popular in South Africa, due to the European heritage in the country. Chicken schnitzels and \"cordon bleu\" schnitzels are a common item on most restaurant menus and hospitals, and in recent years, beef and pork schnitzels have also become widely available.\n\nSchnitzel in Spain is Escalope. \"San Jacobo\" (commonly) or \"cachopo\" (in northen Spain) is usually made with veal or pork stuffed with ham and cheese. For generations it was enjoyed, together with potato omelets, on family picnics in the countryside.\n\nIn Sweden, the dish is called \"schnitzel\" or \"Wienerschnitzel\", and is made most commonly of pork, and is often decorated with a caper-filled circle of either genuine anchovies or the Swedish \"fake\" \"ansjovis\" (made of brine-cured sprats). It is served with rice, fries, or boiled potatoes, and green peas.\n\nSchnitzel, \"Schnipo, Wienerschnitzel\", and \"Rahmschnitzel\" are all popular dishes in Switzerland. \"Schnipo\" (a schnitzel and fried potato combination) is quite popular. The \"Rahmschnitzel\" version is made with either veal or pork and topped with a cream sauce, sometimes including mushrooms. The \"cordon bleu\" variant of schnitzel – two slices of schnitzel (or one with a pocket) filled with cheese, typically Emmentaler or Gruyere, and a slice of ham – is also popular in Switzerland. Also the \"Walliser Schnitzel\" is a variant in which the meat is not breaded, but is fried in oil and then coated with tomato sauce and raclette cheese.\n\nIn Turkey, the dish is spelled \"schnitzel,\" \"şinitzel\", or \"şnitzel,\" and pronounced in a similar way to German. It is made of chicken, and is usually served with rice, French fries, or pasta. Sometimes, it may have grilled cheese in it. It is often cooked at home, as it is an easy-to-do kind of food, but some restaurants have it on their menus.\n\nIn West Ukraine (former Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), it is known as шніцель \"shnitsel′\"; in the rest of the country, it is called as відбивна \"vidbyvna\". It is usually made of pork, or sometimes chicken.\n\nThe pork tenderloin sandwich, popular in the Midwest, is made from a breaded pork tenderloin and is very similar to schnitzel. Especially in the southern states, Chicken fried steak, similar to country fried steak, is another name for schnitzel. It is usually served with white gravy (\"country gravy\"), which is the type of gravy used in \"Sausage Gravy over Biscuits\" but without the sausage in it.\n\nOther variants of the schnitzel, not all necessarily made with a bread crumb crust, include:\n\n"}
{"id": "993052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993052", "title": "Coltrane changes", "text": "Coltrane changes\n\nColtrane changes (Coltrane Matrix or cycle, also known as chromatic third relations and multi-tonic changes) are a harmonic progression variation using substitute chords over common jazz chord progressions. These substitution patterns were first demonstrated by jazz musician John Coltrane on the albums \"Bags & Trane\" (on the track \"Three Little Words\") and \"Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago\" (on \"Limehouse Blues\"). Coltrane continued his explorations on the 1960 album \"Giant Steps\" and expanded on the substitution cycle in his compositions \"Giant Steps\" and \"Countdown\", the latter of which is a reharmonized version of Eddie Vinson's \"Tune Up\". The Coltrane changes are a standard advanced harmonic substitution used in jazz improvisation.\n\nThe changes serve as a pattern of chord substitutions for the ii–V–I progression (supertonic–dominant–tonic) and are noted for the tonally unusual root movement by major thirds (either up or down by a major third interval as opposed to more typical minor or major second intervals, creating an augmented triad. Root movement by thirds is unusual in jazz, as the norm is cycle of fifths root movement, such as ii-V-I, which in the key of C is D minor, G7 and C major.\n\nDavid Demsey, saxophonist and Coordinator of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University, cites a number of influences leading to Coltrane's development of these changes. After Coltrane's death it was proposed that his \"preoccupation with... chromatic third-relations\" was inspired by religion or spirituality, with three equal key areas having numerological significance representing a \"magic triangle\", or, \"the trinity, God, or unity.\" However, Demsey shows that though this meaning was of some importance, third relationships were much more \"earthly,\" or rather historical, in origin. Mention should be made of his interests in Indian ragas during the early 1960s, the Trimurti of Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva may well have been an inherent reference in his chromatic third relations, tritone substitutes, and so on.\n\nIn playing that style, Coltrane found it \"easy to apply the harmonic ideas I had... I started experimenting because I was striving for more individual development.\" He developed his sheets of sound style while playing with Davis and with pianist Thelonious Monk during this period. Saxophonist Odean Pope considers pianist Hasaan Ibn Ali a major influence on Coltrane in his development of the sheets of sound style.\n\nColtrane studied harmony with Dennis Sandole and at the Granoff School of Music in Philadelphia. He explored contemporary techniques and theory. He also studied the \"Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns\" by Nicolas Slonimsky (1947).\n\nThe first appearance of the \"Coltrane changes\" appear in the verse to the standard \"\"Till the Clouds Roll By\" by Jerome Kern. The bridge of the Rodgers and Hart song and jazz standard \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" (1937) predated Tadd Dameron's \"Lady Bird\", after which Coltrane named his \"Lazy Bird\", by incorporating modulation by major third(s). (highlighted yellow below) \"Giant Steps\" and \"Countdown\" may both have taken the inspiration for their augmented tonal cycles from \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\".\n\nThe Coltrane substitution, Coltrane changes, or Countdown formula, is as follows. Start with a ii–V–I turnaround lasting four measures:\nwith the dominant chord (V) preceding the tonic (I).\n\nOne substitutes two chords for each of the first three:\n\nNotice a dominant seventh chord preceding and thus tonicizing a major chord on C and also E and A, both a major third from C.\n\nThis also may begin on C, as on \"Giant Steps\", giving:\n\nThe harmonic use of the chromatic third relation originated in the Romantic era and may occur on any structural level, for example in chord progressions or through key changes. The standard Western chromatic scale has twelve equidistant semitones. When arranged according to the circle of fifths, it looks like this:\n\nLooking above at the marked chords from \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\", B, G and D are spaced a major third apart. On the circle of fifths it appears as an equilateral triangle:\n\nBy rotating the triangle, all of the thirds cycles can be shown. Note that there are only \"four\" unique thirds cycles. This approach can be generalized; different interval cycles will appear as different polygons on the diagram.\nThese are the first eight bars of the Miles Davis composition \"Tune Up\". The chord changes are relatively simple, a straightforward application of the ii–V–I progression, which is extremely common in jazz.\n\nThe chord progression is a standard ii–V–I progression in D major and then in C major. Assume that the time signature is and that each ii and V chord gets four beats and the I chord gets eight beats.\n\nThe Changes below show Coltrane's substitution of chord changes over \"Tune Up\". When writing jazz tunes that substitute chords, it is very common to title the tune with a play on words of the name of the original composition, hence \"Tune \"Up\"\" became \"Count\"down\"\". The ii–V–I progression from \"Tune Up\" still appears but is enhanced with several transition chords that lead to a more complex harmonic progression.\n\nIn the standard Coltrane change cycle the ii–V–I is substituted with a progression of chords that cycle back to the V–I at the end. In a piece, each chord gets two beats per change.\n\nColtrane developed this modified chord progression for \"Countdown\", which is much more complex. At its core, \"Countdown\" is a variation of \"Tune Up\", but the harmonic substitutions occur rapidly and trick the listener into thinking that they are listening to a completely unrelated tune. The ii, V and I remain, but in between are other chords (highlighted in yellow and blue) from the major thirds cycle centered around each I. Preceding the first chord of each major thirds cycle is its V chord.\n\nAn earlier Coltrane piece, \"Lazy Bird\", also features two tonal centers a major third apart in its A section.\n\nThe \"Giant Steps\" cycle is the culmination of Coltrane's theories applied to a completely new chord progression. Coltrane uses the cycle in descending major third tonal transpositions in the opening bars and then ascending ii–V–I progressions separated by a major third in the second section of \"Giant Steps\". The second section is basically the inverse of the bridge section described in \"Have You Met Miss Jones\" above.\n\nAscending/descending ii–V–I progression separated by a major third (tonal centers E, G, B, E, B)\nThis table shows which scales are used for the different chords:\n\nAlthough \"Giant Steps\" and \"Countdown\" are perhaps the most famous examples, both of these compositions use slight variants of the standard \"Coltrane changes\" (The first eight bars of \"Giant Steps\" uses a shortened version that does not return to the I chord, and in \"Countdown\" the progression begins on ii each time.) The standard substitution can be found in several Coltrane compositions and arrangements recorded around this time. These include: \"26-2\" (a reharmonization of Charlie Parker's \"Confirmation\"), \"Satellite\" (based on the standard \"How High the Moon\"), \"Exotica\" (loosely based on the harmonic form of \"I Can't Get Started\"), Coltrane's arrangement of \"But Not for Me\", and on the bridge of his arrangement of \"Body and Soul\".\n\nIn \"Fifth House\" (based on \"Hot House\", i.e. \"What Is This Thing Called Love\") the standard substitution is implied over an ostinato bass pattern with no chordal instrument instructed to play the chord changes. When Coltrane's improvisation superimposes this progression over the ostinato bass, it is easy to hear how he used this concept for his more free playing in later years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "993407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993407", "title": "Hibakusha", "text": "Hibakusha\n\nThe word \"Hibakusha\" is Japanese, originally written in kanji. While the term Hibakusha 被爆者 (hi 被 \"affected\" + baku 爆 \"bomb\" + sha 者 \"person\") has been used before in Japanese to designate any victim of bombs, its worldwide democratisation led to a definition concerning the victims of the atomic bombs dropped in Japan by the American army on the 6th and 9th August of 1945. The victims of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki having been the first to be victims of such weapons, the Japanese term has been used to designate them specifically but also designates other victims of nuclear bombs, such as those of nuclear tests in Bikini, Tibet, Algeria, Kazakhstan and in Xinjiang and of weapons with depleted uranium, probably among which the one in Fallujah.\n\nAnti-nuclear movements and associations, among others of hibakushas, spread the term to designate any direct victim of nuclear disaster, including the ones of the nuclear plant in Fukushima. They therefore prefer the writing 被曝者 (hi 被 \"affected\" + baku 曝 \"exposition\" + sha 者 \"person\") or \"person affected by the exposition\", implying \"person affected by nuclear exposure\". This definition tends to be adopted since 2011.\n\nThe juridic status of Hibakusha is allocated to certain people, mainly by the Japanese government.\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law defines \"hibakusha\" as people who fall into one or more of the following categories: within a few kilometers of the hypocenters of the bombs; within 2 km of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; exposed to radiation from fallout; or not yet born but carried by pregnant women in any of these categories. The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as \"hibakusha\". , 154,859 were still alive, mostly in Japan. The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation. \"Hibakusha\" are entitled to government support. They receive a certain amount of allowance per month, and the ones certified as suffering from bomb-related diseases receive a special medical allowance.\n\nThe memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the \"hibakusha\" who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, , the memorials record the names of almost 495,000 \"hibakusha\"; 314,118 in Hiroshima and 179,226 in Nagasaki.\n\nIn 1957, the Japanese Parliament passed a law providing for free medical care for \"hibakusha\". During the 1970s, non-Japanese \"hibakusha\" who suffered from those atomic attacks began to demand the right for free medical care and the right to stay in Japan for that purpose. In 1978, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that such persons were entitled to free medical care while staying in Japan.\n\nDuring the war, Japan brought many Korean conscripts to both Hiroshima and Nagasaki to work. According to recent estimates, about 20,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and about 2,000 died in Nagasaki. It is estimated that one in seven of the Hiroshima victims was of Korean ancestry. For many years, Koreans had a difficult time fighting for recognition as atomic bomb victims and were denied health benefits. However, most issues have been addressed in recent years through lawsuits.\n\nIt was a common practice before the war for American Issei, or first-generation immigrants, to send their children on extended trips to Japan to study or visit relatives. More Japanese immigrated to the U.S. from Hiroshima than from any other prefecture, and Nagasaki also sent a high number of immigrants to Hawai'i and the mainland. There was, therefore, a sizable population of American-born Nisei and Kibei living in their parents' hometowns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombings. The actual number of Japanese Americans affected by the bombings is unknown – although estimates put approximately 11,000 in Hiroshima city alone – but some 3,000 of them are known to have survived and returned to the U.S. after the war.\n\nA second group of \"hibakusha\" counted among Japanese American survivors are those who came to the U.S. in a later wave of Japanese immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. Most in this group were born in Japan and migrated to the U.S. in search of educational and work opportunities that were scarce in post-war Japan. Many were \"war brides\", or Japanese women who had married American men related to the U.S. military's occupation of Japan.\n\nAs of 2014, there are about 1,000 recorded Japanese American \"hibakusha\" living in the United States. They receive monetary support from the Japanese government and biannual medical checkups with Hiroshima and Nagasaki doctors familiar with the particular concerns of atomic bomb survivors. The U.S. government provides no support to Japanese American \"hibakusha\".\n\nWhile one British Commonwealth citizen\nand seven Dutch POWs (two names known) died in the Nagasaki bombing, at least two POWs reportedly died postwar from cancer thought to have been caused by the atomic bomb.\nOne American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was a Navajo in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.\n\nPeople who suffered the effects of both bombings are known as \"nijū hibakusha\" in Japan.\n\nA documentary called \"Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\" was produced in 2006. The producers found 165 people who were victims of both bombings, and the production was screened at the United Nations.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi (1916–2010) as a double \"hibakusha\". Tsutomu Yamaguchi was confirmed to be 3 kilometers from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He got back to his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, a day before the bomb in Nagasaki was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. Tsutomu Yamaguchi died at the age of 93 on January 4, 2010, of stomach cancer.\n\n\"Hibakusha\" and their children were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination when it comes to prospects of marriage or work due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.\nThe surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than the rate which is observed in the Japanese average.\n\nStuds Terkel's book \"The Good War\" includes a conversation with two \"hibakusha\". The postscript observes:\n\nThe is a group formed by \"hibakusha\" in 1956 with the goals of pressuring the Japanese government to improve support of the victims and lobbying governments for the abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\nSome estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, but how many died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20–30 days.\n\nIn the rare cases of survival for individuals who were in utero at the time of the bombing and yet who still were close enough to be exposed to less than or equal to 0.57 Gy, no difference in their cognitive abilities was found, suggesting a threshold dose for pregnancies below which, no life-limiting issues arise. In 50 or so children who survived the gestational process and were exposed to more than this dose, putting them within about 1000 meters from the hypocenter, microcephaly was observed; this is the only elevated birth defect issue observed in the Hibakusha, occurring in approximately 50 in-utero individuals who were situated less than 1000 meters from the bombings.\n\nFor those who did not suffer ARS, or who survived it. In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 \"Life Span Study\", conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958–1987 and who took part in the study.\n\nAn epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers, of unspecified lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being estimated at 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of plastic arts have been made by hibakushas, often anonymous.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "994299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=994299", "title": "Trans-cultural diffusion", "text": "Trans-cultural diffusion\n\nIn cultural anthropology and cultural geography, cultural diffusion, as conceptualized by Leo Frobenius in his 1897/98 publication \"Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis\", is the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages—between individuals, whether within a single culture or from one culture to another. It is distinct from the diffusion of innovations within a specific culture. Examples of diffusion include the spread of the war chariot and iron smelting in ancient times, and the use of automobiles and Western business suits in the 20th century.\n\nFive major types of cultural diffusion have been defined:\n\nInter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways. Migrating populations will carry their culture with them. Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors, such as merchants, explorers, soldiers, diplomats, slaves, and hired artisans. Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement. Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed. Among literate societies, diffusion can occur through letters, books, and, in modern times, through electronic media.\n\nThere are three categories of diffusion mechanisms:\n\nDirect diffusion was common in ancient times, when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements. Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the mass media and invention of the Internet. Also of interest is the work of American historian and critic Daniel J. Boorstin in his book \"The Discoverers\", in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of explorers in the diffusion of innovations between civilizations.\n\nThe many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are:\n\nA concept that has often been mentioned in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of \"an idea whose time has come\" — whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibnitz, and the inventions of the airplane and of the electronic computer.\n\nHyperdiffusionists deny that parallel evolution or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history; they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture.\n\nEarly theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about South America being the origin of mankind. Antonio de León Pinelo, a Spaniard who settled in Bolivia, claimed in his book \"Paraíso en el Nuevo Mundo\" that the Garden of Eden and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by migrations from there. Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada; in his book \"La Lengua de Adán\" he attempted to prove that Aymara was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in Sorata in the Bolivian Andes. The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine paleontologist Florentino Ameghino in 1880, who published his research in \"La antigüedad del hombre en el Plata\".\n\nThe work of Grafton Elliot Smith fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that copper–producing knowledge spread from Egypt to the rest of the world along with megalithic culture. Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient Egyptians and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers. His views became known as \"Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism\". William James Perry elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using ethnographic data. Another hyperdiffusionist was Lord Raglan; in his book \"How Came Civilization\" (1939) he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from Mesopotamia. Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear, but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia.\n\nDiffusion theory has been advanced as an explanation for the \"European miracle\", the adoption of technological innovation in medieval Europe which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing the Islamic world and China. \nSuch technological import to medieval Europe include gunpowder, clock mechanisms, shipbuilding, paper and the windmill, however, in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies, but improved the manufacturing scale, inherent technology, and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin.\n\nHistorians have questioned recently whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder, the compass, the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures.\n\nHowever historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences, particularly trade, through the middle east & central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the \"rise of the west\". He argues that the renaissance was funded with trade with the east (due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the 4th Crusade), and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe. But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage, and a desperate need to use them in expansion.\n\nWhile the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general, conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed. An example of such disputes is the proposal by Thor Heyerdahl that similarities between the culture of Polynesia and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Andes are due to diffusion from the latter to the former—a theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists.\nHeyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among anthropologists.\n\nMajor contributors to inter-cultural diffusion research and theory include:\n\n\n"}

It grew so popular that additional plants were built in California and Ohio in 1974 and 1978, respectively. In April 1983, Sundor Brands bought out Doric Foods; Sundor Brands was then purchased by Procter & Gamble in March 1989. \n\nThe drink produced an estimated $450 million in revenue for Procter & Gamble in 2004. In 2005, Sunny Delight was spun off into the independent Sunny Delight Beverages Company (SDBC). The beverage is also distributed by Dr Pepper/Seven Up (DPSU). In Canada, the drink is manufactured and distributed by Saputo.\n\nThe beverage was launched in the United Kingdom in April 1998 with a £10 million promotional campaign, and by August 1999, it became the third biggest selling drink in the United Kingdom, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. It was sold in refrigerated cabinets, and marketed as a healthier alternative to soft drinks.\n\nIn the middle of the 1990s, Sunny Delight sponsored an early internet contest promoting their beverage. For the game, the Reach for the Sun Bottle Hunt, simple graphics depicting Sunny Delight \"bottles\" were incorporated into independent American web sites. The site locations were various personal home pages or more well known internet resources.\n\nAt the main contest site, riddles were provided weekly to help people discover each of the sites displaying a hidden bottle. Participants were encouraged to use the newest search engines in combination with the riddles.\n\nInitially appearing in 1996 and gaining widespread attention, the contest was repeated three times over the course of a year and a half, and over 4,000 prizes were awarded during each iteration, ranging from T shirts to college scholarships. As a pioneering internet advertising meme, it set the stage for years of later web marketing promotions.\n\nIn July 2009, to promote the company's Sunny Delight Smoothies, the company partnered with Food Lion supermarkets to place SunnyD Smoothies Peel 'n Taste flavor samplers in the aisles where Sunny Delight products were located.\n\nIn recent years, the artificial sweetener sucralose has been added in combination with high fructose corn syrup, in order to cut the calorie count.\n\nAs of 2013, North American Sunny Delight contained less than 2% concentrated fruit juice.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there were many negative press reports about the product, following an investigation by The Food Commission, an independent consumer organisation in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn December 1999, according to a report by BBC News, the negative publicity escalated when a Sunny Delight television commercial showing a snowman turning orange was released, at about the same time as reports of a four-year-old girl who experienced her skin turning orange – due to the product's use of beta-Carotene for color – after drinking an estimated 1.5 liters of Sunny Delight a day.\n\nSales had halved by 2001, and the drink was redesigned and re invented in March 2003 as \"SunnyD\". In the United Kingdom, SunnyD was again relaunched in March 2009, with a new formulation containing 70% fruit juice and no artificial ingredients or added sugar. However, amid declining sales, the product was further reformulated in April 2010, as a lower priced beverage containing only 15% fruit juice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "996061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=996061", "title": "Gas blending for scuba diving", "text": "Gas blending for scuba diving\n\nGas blending for scuba diving (or Gas mixing) is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive, by reducing the risk of decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis, and may improve ease of breathing.\n\nFilling cylinders with a mixture of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.\n\nMethods used include batch mixing by partial pressure or by mass fraction, and continuous blending processes. Completed blends are analysed for composition for the safety of the user. Gas blenders may be required by legislation to prove competence if filling for other persons.\n\nFor some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used to advantage, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives. A common misconception is that nitrox can reduce narcosis, but research has shown that oxygen is also narcotic.\n\nThe increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.\n\nFor dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times.\n\nThere are several hazards associated with gas mixing:\n\nIt is possible for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. Too much or too little oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver. Oxygen analysers are used to measure the oxygen content of the mix after blending. Inadequate mixing may cause inaccurate analysis. To ensure that the composition of the gas is known by the end user, the contents are analysed in the presence of the diver who acknowledges the contents by signing a log.\n\nIt is possible that toxic contaminants, such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon lubricants, will enter the cylinders from the diving air compressor. This is generally a problem with the compressor maintenance or location of the air input to the compressor though it can be from other sources.\n\nToxic contaminants can also get into the breathing mix if any material inside the blending valves or pipes burns, for instance when adiabatic heating occurs when decanting or boosting oxygen.\n\nIn the presence of large volumes of high-pressure oxygen, one corner of fire triangle exists in good measure. It is vital the other two corners are not allowed to exist.\n\nInternally, the blending equipment and diving cylinders must be oxygen clean; all fuels and particles which could be sources of ignition must be removed. The materials chosen for use in the valves, joints and compressors must be oxygen compatible: they must not burn or degrade readily in high oxygen environments.\n\nIn gas blending, high temperatures are easily produced, by adiabatic heating, simply by decanting high-pressure gas into lower pressure pipes or cylinders. The pressure falls as the gas leaves the opened valve but then increases when the gas encounters obstructions such as a cylinder or a bend, constriction or particle in the pipe-work.\n\nOne simple way to reduce the heat of decanting is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.\n\nSpaces where gas is blended or oxygen is stored should be well ventilated to avoid high concentrations of oxygen and the risk of fire.\n\nWith nitrox there are several methods of gas mixing:\n\nHelium mixes may be made by partial pressure blending, mass fraction blending or compressing a premix blended at atmospheric pressure (continuous blending).\n\nGas is mixed by decanting or compressing the component gases into a high-pressure cylinder, measured by partial pressure, added in sequence, and corrected for temperature.\n\nWith trimix, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted into a cylinder, which is \"topped up\" with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen. An alternative is to first decant helium into a cylinder and then top it up to the working pressure with a known nitrox mix. Both NAUI and TDI offer courses using a trimix that they call \"helitrox\", blended by the latter method, which limit the fraction of helium to about 17–20%. Mixtures made by blending helium with nitrox containing around one-third oxygen such as EAN32 (a common premixed nitrox) have the desirable property that at their maximum operating depth for a partial pressure of oxygen of 1.4 bar, their equivalent narcotic depth is always approximately , a safe limit.\n\nWith heliox, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted or pumped into a cylinder, resulting in a two gas mix of oxygen and helium.\n\nWith heliair, a measured pressure of helium is decanted into a cylinder, which is \"topped up\" with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen, with the nitrogen:oxygen ratio fixed at 4:1.\n\nMass fraction blending requires an accurate scale which should preferably be capable of being set to zero with the empty cylinder connected to the filling whip standing on the scale.\n\nThe masses of the gases to be mixed must be calculated based on the final partial pressure ratio and total pressure, and the cylinder is filled to the appropriate weight corresponding to the added weight of each component. The advantage of this system is that temperature does not affect the accuracy, as pressure is not measured during the process. The disadvantage is that helium has a much lower density than the other components, and a small error in measured mass of helium will result in a relatively large error in composition.\n\nContinuous blending is the process of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the mixture into a storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.\n\nMost high-pressure breathing gas compressors are designed to accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. and one of the usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric air, so it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric pressure in an accessory to the compressor called a \"mixing tube\" or \"blending stick\". The mixing tube may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used.\n\nOne popular configuration for the mixing tube is a large bore tube with a series of internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.\n\nContinuous blending by adding oxygen and helium in series allows change in oxygen partial pressure to be used as a proxy for helium content measurement. The oxygen is added first, and PO measured after mixing, then helium is added in a second mixing tube and PO measured at the outlet after mixing. The difference in PO can be used to calculate PHe, or conversely, a desired trimix product partial pressures can be used to calculate the PO for the nitrox and trimix stages of the blend.\n\nGas flow rates are usually controlled by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, and may be measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes.\n\nThe blended gases at the intake to the compressor will be at a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by the pressure of the measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a pressure drop, as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tube and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced inlet pressure for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the pressure drop or absolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of absolute pressure at the point of measurement.\n\nMany high-pressure compressors used for breathing gases are suitable for compressing breathing gas mixtures containing moderate fractions of oxygen and helium, but the manufacturer should be consulted regarding limits on both gases. Compression of mixtures with a high fraction of oxygen are an increased fire hazard, and the compressor lubricant must be compatible to minimise this risk. Helium poses a very different problem, as it is totally inert, and creates no fire hazard directly, but its temperature rises more than oxygen and nitrogen when compressed, which can cause a compressor designed for air to overheat. This can eventually lead to problems with the compressor lubricant and bearings, and if the oxygen fraction is also high, this will increase the fire hazard. Fortunately most Trimix blends have an oxygen fraction inversely related to the helium fraction, which reduces the probability of this problem.\n\nThe mixed gas must be analysed before use, as an inaccurate assumption of composition can lead to problems of hypoxia or oxygen toxicity in the case of the oxygen analysis, and decompression sickness if the inert gas components differ from the planned composition. Analysis of oxygen fraction is usually done using an electro-galvanic oxygen sensor, whereas helium fraction is usually done by a heat transfer comparison between the analysed gas and a standard sample.\n\nTo avoid oxygen toxicity and narcosis, the diver needs to plan the required mix to be blended and to check the proportions of oxygen and inert gases in the blended mix before diving. Generally the tolerance of each final component gas fraction should be within +/-1% of the required fraction. Analysis instruments commonly used by recreational/technical diving gas blenders are typically capable of a resolution of 0.1% for both oxygen and helium.\n\nWhen blending mixes with pressures up to about , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations can be used to calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix. At this pressure and normal temperatures, air departs from linearity by about 5%, e.g. a 10-litre cylinder filled to 230 bar with air only contains about 95% of the expected 2300 litres of free air. Above this pressure, the composition of the final mix is difficult to predict using simple equations but needs the more complex Van der Waals equation.\n\nPartial pressure blending using ideal gas calculations is fairly straightforward. The required mixture is chosen, either as a \"best mix\" which optimises the decompression advantages for acceptable oxygen exposure based on the planned dive profile, or selected from a range of standardised mixes suitable for a range of depths and times, or optimised to suit available gas stocks or other constraints. The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance.\n\nThe nitrogen in the mixture is almost always provided by topping up the cylinder with air to the filling pressure. All helium, and some of the oxygen is provided by decanting or boosting from bulk cylinders.\n\nThe amount of helium that must be decanted is very simple to calculate: Multiply the desired gas fraction of helium (F) by the total filling pressure (P) to get partial pressure of helium (P). In the case of the Tx 20/40, in a 230 bar cylinder, this would be 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar (or for a 3,000 psi fill, it would require 3,000 x 40% = 1,200 psi of helium).\n\nThe amount of oxygen is more difficult to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air top-up. However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air top-up, so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar, so the air top-up pressure is 92 bar/79% = 116 bar (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500 psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230 bar - 92 bar - 116 bar = 22 bar is the added oxygen pressure required for the mix (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300 psi of oxygen).\n\nAt pressures above about 200 bar the compression of gases begins to deviate from the ideal gas laws, and consequently partial pressure blending must take into account that the gases added at higher pressure will provide lower volumetric proportion than gases added at lower pressure, and these deviations from linearity will vary according to the gas. Calculations for high pressure partial pressure blends may require use of the Van der Waals equation. This does not affect premixed gases, which will retain their mix ratio at any pressure, so continuous blending is not affected by this problem.\n\nBoth nitrogen and oxygen compress relatively linearly and will approximate the ideal gas to much higher pressures than helium, which deviates significantly even below 200 bar. Air and nitrox mixtures can be approximated as ideal without significant error up to about 230 bar at normal temperatures.\n\nIncreases in temperature when filling make it difficult to accurately decant or pump a measured quantity of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver.\n\nThere are several solutions to this problem:\n\nBefore a gas mix leaves the blending station and before the diver breathes from it, the fraction of oxygen in the mix should be checked. Usually electro-galvanic oxygen sensors are used to measure the oxygen fraction. Helium analyzers also exist, although they are expensive at present, which allow the Trimix diver to find out the proportion of helium in the mix.\n\nIt is important that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.\n\nReliable specifications for the amount of agitation required for complete mixing are not available, but if the analysis remains the same before and after agitation the gas is probably fully mixed. Once mixed, gas will not stratify with time.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and South Africa, oxygen and helium are bought from commercial industrial and medical gas suppliers and typically delivered in 50 litre \"J\" cylinders at a maximum of 200 bar. In addition to the cost of the gas, charges may be made for cylinder rental and delivery.\n\nThe \"cascade system\" is used to decant economically from banks of storage cylinders so that the maximum possible gas is removed from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder's pressure and then from the next higher pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximises the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimises the use of high-pressure bank gas.\n\nBooster pumps, such as the Haskel pump, can be used to scavenge the remnants of expensive gases in nearly empty cylinders allowing low-pressure gases to be pumped safely into cylinders already containing gas at higher pressure.\n\nTraining and certification for scuba gas blending is provided by some diver training agencies,and may be required in terms of national legislation or standards. ISO 13293 provides minimum training standards for gas blenders for recreational diving services at two levels.\n"}

Fresh (unsalted) cod is referred to as \"bacalhau fresco\" (fresh cod).\n\n\"Bacalhau\" dishes are common in Portugal, and also in former Portuguese colonies like Cape Verde, Angola, Macau, Brazil, and Goa. There are said to be over 1000 recipes in Portugal alone and it can be considered the iconic ingredient of Portuguese cuisine (but curiously the only fish that is not consumed fresh in this fish loving country, boasting the highest per capita fish consumption within the European Union). It is often cooked on social occasions and is the traditional Christmas Eve dinner in some parts of Portugal.\n\nSimilar recipes can be found across Europe. It is also found in the cuisines of other territories and regions like Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. In Norway, where most of the salted and dried cod is ostensibly produced, \"bacalao\" commonly refers to a specific dish prepared with salted and dried cod, potatoes, onions, tomatoes and olives. In recent years, there has also been increasing interest in the wider range of Portuguese dishes based on dried and salted cod, however.\n\nSalted, dried cod ostensibly comes from Norway (\"bacalhau da Noruega\"), Iceland (\"bacalhau da Islândia\") or Newfoundland (\"bacalhau da Terra Nova\"). It used to be very affordable, but with the collapse of the cod stocks and dismantling of Portuguese \"bacalhoeiro\" fleet, it became more expensive, especially near Easter and Christmas time, since it is a part of many traditional dishes of the holiday season.\n\nThere are numerous \"bacalhau\" recipe variations, depending on region and tradition.In Portugal, it is said there are more than 365 ways to cook \"bacalhau\", one for every day of the year; others say there are 1,001 ways. Whatever the exact number, bacalhau is a ubiquitous ingredient in Portuguese cuisine.\n\nBacalhau is often served with potatoes. Green (\"Vinho Verde\") or mature wines (Alentejo Wine, Dão Wine, or Douro Wine) are served alongside.\n\nSome Bacalhau dishes:\n\nSalt cod has been produced for at least 500 years, since the time of the European discoveries of the New World. Before refrigeration, there was a need to preserve the cod; drying and salting are ancient techniques to preserve nutrients and the process makes the cod tastier. More importantly, fish low in oils and fats allow for the drying and preservation process to occur: oils and fats prevent the salt water from preserving the fish. Cod fish have very low levels of oils, and most is located in the guts.\n\nPortuguese, Norman, Breton, and English fisherman were the first to adopt the salt-based curing technique from Basque fishermen in Newfoundland near the cod-rich Grand Banks by the late 1400s. By the 1700s, salted cod had become a staple food for ordinary Portuguese people and by upper levels of Portuguese society. With the advancements in freezing and transportation in the 1900s, salted cod from North America declined and Iceland and Norway became the major supplier of the salted fish to Portuguese markets. During this time \"bacalhau\" was a cheap source of protein and frequently consumed. Thus, ' became a staple of the Portuguese cuisine, nicknamed ' (loyal friend). In fact, there is no word in Portuguese for fresh cod; it is instead called \"fresh salt cod\".\n\nThis dish is also popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries because of the church. For example, the Church forbade the eating of meat on many days (Fridays, Lent, and other festivals), and so \"\" dishes were eaten instead. Bacalhau is also popular in Sfax where this dish is eaten in the first day of Eid ul-Fitr with chermoula.\n\nIn Portugal, ' is often sold as a generic product with no brand information. Customers are free to touch, smell, and otherwise personally inspect the fish, which is very different to how fresh seafood is often sold. Stores can carry a large variety of ' differing in color, size, smell, taste, and dryness. Such variation has led Portugal to define requirements as to what products can carry the label \"\"Bacalhau de Cura Tradicional Portuguesa\"\".\n\n\n"}

The food is traditionally cooked by steaming the ingredients over layers of seaweed. The shellfish can be supplemented with vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and corn on the cob. Clambakes are usually held on festive occasions along the coast of New England.\n\nA typical clambake begins with gathering seaweed (traditionally rockweed – \"Ascophyllum nodosum\") at the shoreline; seaweed is an important adjunct to cooking the food. To keep the seaweed fresh, it is necessary to have a container large enough to hold both the seaweed and a fair amount of sea water.\nAlso important are several round medium-sized stones, or sometimes cannonballs, which are heated in the fire and used to re-radiate heat during the cooking process.\n\nLastly, like most other methods of steaming, a cover is necessary to allow the trapped heat and steam to thoroughly cook the food. Canvas tarps or potato sacks soaked in sea water are often used for this purpose.\n\nOnce the stones and seaweed have been collected, a fire pit is prepared. Some prefer to simply start a fire within the pit, while others line the edges with flat stones to provide support for a metal grill on which the stones may be placed.\n\nThe stones used for cooking are then placed in the center of the pit and a wood fire is started, although the exact method of heating the stones varies. The fire must burn until the stones are glowing hot. Care must be taken to ensure that the fire will burn out shortly after this optimal cooking temperature is achieved. The ashes are then swept off the stones and raked between them to form an insulating \"bed.\" A layer of wet seaweed is placed over the stones, followed by traditional regional foods such as steamers, mussels, quahogs, and lobsters. Side dishes usually include corn on the cob, potatoes, carrots, and onions. Alternating layers of seaweed and food are piled on top and the entire mound is covered with canvas that has been drenched in water to seal in the heat and prevent the canvas from burning. The food is allowed to steam for several hours.\n\nSince many locales outlaw building fires on beaches, and in order to accommodate the dish in homes or backyards, this dish is often prepared in a large pot. This is known as a New England clam boil. Some caterers specialize in clambakes on the beach.\n\nClambakes are also popular in Northeast Ohio despite that region not being near the Atlantic Ocean. A typical clambake there includes a dozen clams with half a chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot. John D. Rockefeller started the tradition in Ohio.\n\n"}

The most common form of Jaffa cakes are circular, in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jam and a coating of chocolate. Jaffa cakes are also available as bars or in small packs, and in larger and smaller sizes. The original Jaffa Cakes come in packs of 12, 24, 36, or 48.\n\nBecause McVitie's did not trademark the name \"Jaffa Cakes\", other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.\n\nMcVitie's entire line of Jaffa cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie's factory in Stockport. The Jaffa cake production area covers an acre () and includes a production line over a mile () long which sits on the Stockport side of the site's boundary with Manchester. Because of the nature of the product – having multiple components of cake, chocolate covering and jam – special hardware accelerators were devised to allow rapid computer inspection of 20 products per second, taking place under four symmetrically placed lights.\n\nAlthough Jaffa cakes are usually orange flavour, limited edition flavours have been available, such as lemon-and-lime, strawberry and blackcurrant.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes. McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits. McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and allegedly produced a giant Jaffa cake in court to illustrate its point. The product was assessed on the following criteria:\n\n\nThe court found in favour of McVitie's and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa cakes in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Ireland, Jaffa cakes are regarded as cakes by Revenue as their moisture content is greater than 12%.

It shares a name with a stew from the Philippines made with pork and pork liver.\n\nHominy, lime, onions, and oregano are used to season the broth.\n\nMenudo is traditionally a family food prepared by the entire family, and often serves as an occasion for social interactions such as after wedding receptions where the families of the groom and bride go to either family's house to enjoy a bowl of menudo before and after the ceremony. It is also a pseudoscientific remedy for recovery of alcoholic consumption.\n\nMenudo is time intensive to prepare, as the tripe takes hours to cook. It includes many ingredients and side dishes (such as salsa), chopped onions and cilantro garnish, and is often prepared communally and eaten at a feast. Documents from the Works Progress Administration indicate that in the 1930s, among migrant workers in Arizona, menudo parties were held regularly to celebrate births, Christmas, and other occasions.\n\nFour to seven hours to cook are required. Those who sell beef tripe offer a version of this meat which has been previously processed by boiling it in hot water, which reduces cooking time by hours. In its simplest form, beef tripe is rinsed then boiled for three hours in a large pot with half an onion to remove the strong odor of the tripe. It is then removed from the pot, discarding the onion half, and allowed to cool before being cut into strips, or occasionally diced. The water is removed and discarded, then the tripe is put back into the pot and fresh water, oregano, red chili paste or powder, lime/lemon juice, hominy, and salt are added and boiled.\n\nMenudo is typically served with chopped raw onions, oregano, and lemon or lime segments along with corn or flour tortillas.\n\nMenudo almost always includes tripe, and some versions of the dish in Mexico also include honeycomb and \"librillo\" beef meat along with the beef feet and tendons. Versions of the dish which include meats other than tripe has a much longer cooking time. Pigs feet are also used in northern style menudo for example Chihuahua. The feet and tendons are boiled first at low to medium heat for about three hours. After the first three hours, the tripe should be added along with salt, an onion cut in half, and one or two heads of garlic. Red menudo has the addition of Guajillo chili paste. The menudo is allowed to continue boiling for an additional three hours while covered. Once it is almost done, the hominy is added.\n\nThere are a number of regional variations on menudo. In northern Mexico, typically hominy is added. In northwest states such as Sinaloa and Sonora usually only the \"blanco,\" or white, variation is seen; \"menudo blanco\" is the same dish, with the difference that red pepper is not added (though jalapeño or chopped green chilies may be added to the broth to replace the spice found in the red version), thus giving the broth a clear or white color. Adding \"patas\" (beef or pigs feet) to the stew is popular in the U.S. but not universal. In some areas of central Mexico, \"menudo\" refers to a stew of sheep stomach, \"pancitas\" stew of beef tongue. In South-Western Mexico (in and around the Distrito Federal, Morelos, and Guerrero) it is called \"panza\" or \"panza guisada\". The red variation is usually seen in Chihuahua, the northern state adjoining Texas. It is also usual to use only yellow hominy in menudo in the Texas region. A similar stew made with more easily cooked meat is pozole. Some variations of menudo substitute garbanzo beans instead of hominy.\n\nIn the United States, since the mid-20th century, prepared menudo has been common in food stores and restaurants in cosmopolitan areas and in other areas with a significant Mexican population. Restaurants often feature it as a special on Saturday and Sunday, and the folklore belief that menudo will alleviate some of the symptoms of a hangover is widely held.\n\nAn annual Menudo Festival is held in Santa Maria, California. In 2009, more than 2,000 people attended and 13 restaurants competed for prizes in three categories. The festival is organized by the National Latino Peace Officers Association of Northern Santa Barbara County and the money raised goes toward scholarships for local students.\n\n\n"}

A modification of the ileum, the spiral valve is internally twisted or coiled to increase the surface area of the intestine, to increase nutrient absorption.\n\nThe intestines of a shark are much shorter than those of mammals. Sharks have compensated for this problem by having a spiral valve, or a scroll valve, inside the intestine to increase the absorbent surface of the intestine. By keeping digestible material in the ileum for an extended period maximum nutrient absorption is ensured. For this reason, many sharks and related fish feed very infrequently. The food passes into the comparatively short colon of the shark almost fully digested, and then out the cloaca and vent.\n\nA consequence of the spiral valve constricting the lumen of the ileum is that sharks cannot pass large hard objects (such as bones) through their lower intestine. Such objects rather remain in the stomach until sufficiently broken down for passing through the valve region, or are regurgitated. Consequently, shark stomachs often contain items of interest that enable one to determine what the animals feed on, as well as non-food items ingested during a feeding frenzy.\n\nSharks also possess a rectal gland that removes excess salt.\n\n"}

{"id": "1006214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1006214", "title": "Remoulade", "text": "Remoulade\n\nRémoulade (; ) is a condiment invented in France that is usually aioli- or mayonnaise-based. Although similar to tartar sauce, it is often more yellowish (or reddish in Louisiana), sometimes flavored with curry, and sometimes contains chopped pickles or piccalilli. It can also contain horseradish, paprika, anchovies, capers and a host of other items. While its original purpose was possibly for serving with meats, it is now more often used as a condiment or dipping sauce, primarily for sole, plaice, and seafood cakes (such as crab or salmon cakes).\n\nRemoulade is used in France, Denmark, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and in the United States, especially in Louisiana Creole cuisine. It is often used with french fries, on top of roast beef items, and as a hot dog condiment, although there are a multitude of other applications:\n\nAccording to \"Larousse Gastronomique\", rémoulade is 250 ml (1 cup) of mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons mixed herbs (parsley, chives, chervil and tarragon), 1 tablespoon drained capers, 2 finely diced cornichons and a few drops of anchovy essence (optional). Some recipes use chopped anchovy fillets. The rémoulade used in céleri-rave rémoulade is not the same as the remoulades discussed in this article, but is instead based on a simple mustard-flavoured vinegar and oil dressing spiced with salt, pepper, and chopped green herbs. Rémoulade is classified in French cooking as a derivative of the mayonnaise sauce.\n\nDanish remoulade has a mild, sweet-sour taste and a medium yellow color. The typical industrially-made variety does not contain capers, but finely-chopped cabbage and pickled cucumber, fair amounts of sugar and hints of mustard, cayenne pepper, coriander and onion, and turmeric for color. The herbs are replaced by herbal essences, e.g., tarragon vinegar. Starch, gelatin or milk protein may be added as thickeners.\n\nHomemade or gourmet varieties may use olive oil (especially good with fish), capers, pickles, carrots, cucumber, lemon juice, dill, chervil, parsley or other fresh herbs, and possibly curry.\n\nIn Denmark remoulade is mostly used for french fries, hotdogs and for open sandwiches with roast beef or fried fish.\n\nLouisiana remoulade can vary from the French-African Creole, the rustic Afro-Caribbean Creole, or the Classic Cajun version, and like the local variants of roux, each version is different from the French original. Creole versions often have tan or pink hues and are usually piquant. Louisiana-style remoulades fall generally into one of two categories—those with a mayonnaise base and those with an oil base, but sometimes both mayonnaise and oil are used. Each version may have finely chopped vegetables, usually green onions and celery, and parsley; most are made with either Creole or stone-ground mustard. Salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper are also standard ingredients. In the oil- and mayonnaise-based versions, the reddish hue often comes from the addition of a small amount of ketchup and/or paprika. The sauce is often topped with paprika for the aesthetics as well as the flavor. Generally, lemon juice or vinegar are added for acidity. Other additions include hardboiled egg or raw egg yolks, minced garlic, hot sauce, vinegar, horseradish, capers, cornichons, and Worcestershire sauce.\n\nWhile the classic white remoulade is a condiment that can be offered in a variety of contexts (e.g., the classic celery root remoulade), Creole remoulade is used on shrimp, crabs, fried calamari, artichokes, and fried green tomatoes among other foods. Today, shrimp remoulade is a very common cold appetizer in New Orleans Creole restaurants, although, historically, hard boiled eggs with remoulade was a less expensive option on some menus. Shrimp remoulade is most often served as a stand-alone appetizer (usually on a chiffonade of iceberg lettuce). One might also see crawfish remoulade, but restaurants seldom offer remoulade sauce as an accompaniment with fish, where cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are generally preferred. however, food columnist and cookbook author Leon Soniat does suggest to \"Serve <nowiki>[remoulade]</nowiki> over seafood or with sliced asparagus.\"\n\nCentral Mississippi has comeback sauce, a condiment that is very similar to Louisiana remoulade.\n\n\n"}

It has been produced since 1917, claiming to be \"the oldest continuing soft drink company still run by the same family\".\n\nWhen the Maysville Syrup Company of Maysville, Kentucky went bankrupt in 1917, Lewis D. Peeler and other invested businessmen moved the company to North Carolina and renamed it the Carolina Beverage Corporation.\nThat same year, Peeler purchased a recipe for a cherry flavored soda from a Saint Louis flavor salesman, which eventually became Cheerwine. Though it has been around since 1917, Cheerwine first became a registered trademark in 1926.\n\nThe family of Lewis Peeler has run the Cheerwine company since its founding, and his great-grandson Charles Clifford “Cliff” Ritchie has been CEO and president of Cheerwine's parent company, Carolina Beverage Corporation since 1992.\nCheerwine has a mildly sweet flavor with strong cherry notes, most notably black cherry; is burgundy-colored; and has an unusually high degree of carbonation compared to other soft drinks. The product was named for its color and taste; the company website states that \"it made sense to name a burgundy-red, bubbly, cherry concoction—Cheerwine.\" The \"Retro Cheerwine\" variant is sold in glass bottles and is sweetened with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Despite its name, Cheerwine is not really a wine and contains no alcohol.\n\nThe company also markets Cheerwine flavored ice cream, sherbet, and cream bars, mainly in Food Lion, a Salisbury, NC-based supermarket chain. A commercially baked Cheerwine cake, based on an old Southern recipe, became available through a Salisbury-based company in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the company began a re-branding campaign designed to revamp the drink's image, especially among younger consumers. The re-branding called for a redesign of the Cheerwine packaging, with a new, retro-style logo based on an early Cheerwine logo.\n\nIn 2010, Cheerwine partnered with the North Carolina-based doughnut company, Krispy Kreme, and released a limited-offered Cheerwine flavored donut on July 1 of that year. It was sold only at select grocery stores for the month of July, and at the Salisbury Krispy Kreme. The Cheerwine doughnut returned again in July 2011. Cheerwine Kreme, a soda with the flavors of Cheerwine and Krispy Kreme, was sold during the summers of 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn 2010, Canton, Ohio-based Old Carolina Barbecue became the first restaurant chain in Ohio to offer Cheerwine as a fountain drink. By 2014, Cheerwine-based products including iced slushi, Cheerwine cakes and floats had become a signature part of the Old Carolina concept.\n\nMorgan Shepherd ran an entry in the NASCAR Busch Series (now the Nationwide Series) in the mid-1990s with Cheerwine sponsorship.\n\nCheerwine is sometimes mixed with Captain Morgan rum to make a drink called \"Captain Cheerwine\" or the \"Whining Pirate\". \n\nA \"Cheerwine Recipe Book\" was published in 2017, by Sandy Carol Sider.\n\nAs of June 2017, Cheerwine is certified as kosher.\n\nSlogans have included \"Born in the South. Raised in a Glass\", \"Nectar of the South\", \"Betcha can't not smile.\" and, starting in March 2018, \"Uniquely Southern.\"\n\nCheerwine is currently available in much of the southeastern United States, from West Virginia south to Florida, but is better known in the Carolinas and Virginia. Other spots to find Cheerwine are the many \"specialty soda\" stores throughout the country, as well as WinCo Foods in Washington state, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurants, Sheetz convenience stores in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and overseas, in Norway. It is sold either as a single bottle or as a pack of four.\n\nIn April 2005, other regions of the United States began to bottle Cheerwine, mainly through Pepsi distributors.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, \"The New York Times\" Diner's Journal referred to \"The Expanding Cult of Cheerwine\".\n\nOn April 5, 2011, the company announced plans for nationwide distribution by 2017, the product's 100th anniversary. The same day, the company also introduced a new advertising campaign, \"Born in the South. Raised in a glass.\" At the time, Cheerwine was available in 12 percent of the nation. Radio commercials for that campaign include \"The Caper\", where criminals left everything from a store except Cheerwine; and \"Battle of the Bulge\", in which a soldier from the Salisbury area has two bottles sent to him during World War II and gives one to his friend.\n\nAlso in April 2011, Cheerwine announced it was searching for a woman to represent the company as \"Miss Cheerwine\". Candidates had to be 21 to 25 years old and live in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Virginia. A company spokesperson stated, \"We’re looking for a poised, enthusiastic young woman who can help us spread the legend and get Cheerwine into the hands of our fans with charm, confidence, sweetness and a sense of fun.\" On June 3, 2011, Spencer Cummings, named the first Miss Cheerwine, began the Miss Cheerwine Summer Legend Tour.\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Cheerwine announced plans to partner with Pepsi Beverages Co. in Atlanta, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee. The same week, the company began using glass bottles to distribute the \"Original 1917 Formula\" with sugar, as well as introduced 12-pack cans.\n\nOn June 16, 2014, Birmingham's Buffalo Rock Co. announced Cheerwine distribution in Alabama, western Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. This added about 6.5 million potential new customers to their distribution footprint.\n\nCheerwine has sponsored the North Carolina band the Avett Brothers on tour.\n\n"}

Initially herring is cured with salt to extract water. The second stage involves removing the salt and adding the herring to a brine – typically a vinegar, salt, sugar solution – to which ingredients such as peppercorn, bay leaves and raw onions are added. Additional flavourings may also be used, including sherry, mustard and dill, while other non-traditional ingredients have also begun being included in recent years.\n\nPickled herring remains a popular food and/or ingredient to dishes in many parts of Europe including Scandinavia, the Baltic, Eastern and Central Europe, as well as the Netherlands. It is also associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, becoming a staple at Kiddushes and social gatherings. Pickled herring is one of the twelve dishes traditionally served at Christmas Eve in Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine.\n\nPickled herrings have been a staple in Northern Europe since Medieval times, being a way to store and transport fish, especially necessary in meatless periods like Lent. The herrings would be prepared, then packed in barrels for storage or transportation.\n\nIn the Nordic countries, once the pickling process is finished and depending on which of the dozens of classic herring flavourings (mustard, onion, garlic, lingonberries etc.) are selected, it is eaten with dark rye bread, crisp bread, sour cream, or potatoes. This dish is common at Christmas, Easter and Midsummer, where it is frequently eaten along with spirits like akvavit. \n\nSoused herring (\"maatjesharing\" or just \"maatjes\" in Dutch) is an especially mild salt herring, which is made from young immature herrings. The herrings are ripened for a couple of days in oak barrels in a salty solution, or brine. \nThe term “soused herring” in English can also describe a marinated herring that has been cooked.\nRollmops are pickled herring fillets rolled (hence the name) into a cylindrical shape around a piece of pickled gherkin or an onion. They are thought to have developed as a special treat in 19th century Berlin, and the word borrowed from the German.\n\nPickled herring, especially brined herring, is common in Russia and Ukraine, where it is served cut into pieces and seasoned with sunflower oil and onions, or can be part of herring salads, such as dressed herring (, , lit. 'herring under a fur coat'), which are usually prepared with vegetables and seasoned with mayonnaise dressing.\n\nBrined herring is common in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, perhaps best known for vorschmack salad known in English simply as \"chopped herring\" and as schmaltz herring in Yiddish. In Israel it is commonly known as \"dag maluach\" which means \"salted fish\".\n\nPickled herring can also be found in the cuisine of Hokkaidō in Japan, where families traditionally preserved large quantities for winter.\n\nIn Nova Scotia, Canada, pickled herring with onions is called \"solomon gundy\" and is quite popular. (Not to be confused with the Jamaican pickled fish pâté of the same name).\n\n\"Bismarck herring\" (German \"Bismarckhering\") is the common name for pickled herring in Germany, and is sometimes sold elsewhere under that name. There are various theories as to why the product is associated with Bismarck.\n\nIt is rich in tyramine and thus should be avoided in the diet of people being treated with an antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitor.\n\nPickled herring is one of many sources of natural vitamin D3. It is also a source of selenium and vitamin B12. 100 grams may provide 680 IU of vitamin D or 170% of the DV, as well as 84% of the DV for selenium and 71% of the DV for vitamin B12. \n\n\n"}

Introduced in 1876, it is considered the second longest continuously made soft drink in the United States. Only Vernors ginger ale, dating to 1866, is older.\n\nHires Root Beer was created by Philadelphia pharmacist Charles Elmer Hires. The official story is that Hires first tasted root beer, a traditional American beverage dating back to the colonial era, while on his honeymoon in 1875. However, historical accounts vary and the actual time and place of the discovery may never be known. By 1876, Hires had developed his own recipe and was marketing 25-cent packets of powder which each yielded five gallons of root beer. At Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876, he cultivated new customers by giving away free glasses of root beer. Hires marketed it as a solid concentrate of sixteen wild roots and berries. It claimed to purify the blood and make rosy cheeks. In 1884, he began producing a liquid extract and a syrup for use in soda fountains, and was soon shipping root beer in kegs and producing a special fountain dispenser called the \"Hires Automatic Munimaker.\" In 1890, the Charles E. Hires Company incorporated and began supplying Hires root beer in small bottles claiming over a million bottles sold by 1891.\n\nBut Hires's choice of name for his product caused a problem: the word \"beer\" drew the wrath of the temperance movement. He had his root beer tested by a laboratory, and trumpeted their conclusion that a glass of his root beer contained less alcohol than a loaf of bread.\nHires Root Beer was promoted as \"The Temperance Drink\" and \"the Greatest Health-Giving Beverage in the World.\" Hires advertised aggressively, believing \"doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you are doing, but nobody ELSE does.\"\nOne of the major ingredients of root beer was sassafras oil, a plant root extract used in beverages for its flavor and presumed medicinal properties. The medicinal properties of root beer are emphasized in the advertising slogan, \"Join Health and Cheer; Drink Hires Rootbeer.\" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned sassafras oil in 1960 because it contains the carcinogen and liver-damaging chemical safrol. However, a process was later discovered by which the harmful chemical could be removed from sassafras oil while preserving the flavor.\n\nPrior to the move to \"natural and artificial flavors\", Hires ingredients included carbonated water, sugar, dextrose, caramel, plant extractives of birch, sassafras, licorice, vanilla, spikenard, sarsaparilla, hops, wintergreen, pipsissewa, ginger and flavor.\n\nHires Root Beer kits, available in the United States and Canada from the early 1900s through the 1980s allowed consumers to mix an extract with water, sugar and yeast to brew their own root beer. However, most consumption was of pre-bottled root beer.\n\nA mid-1960s' advertising campaign featured jingles by jazz singer Blossom Dearie, wherein she sang in a Betty-Boop voice: \"Hires Root Beer! Hires Rootin' Tootin' Root Beer! Hires Rootin'-Tootin' Rabble-Rousin', lion-roarin', Roman-candle-lightin' Root Beer!\"\n\nConsolidated Foods bought the company from the Hires family in 1960, only to sell Hires two years later to Crush International. Procter & Gamble bought Crush in 1980, and sold it to Cadbury Schweppes in 1989. Cadbury divested its soft drinks arm in 2008, and the beverage company renamed itself Keurig Dr Pepper that year.\n\nIn Canada, the Hires brand is no longer sold by Keurig Dr Pepper; retailers and vending machines have replaced it with Pepsi-owned Mug Root Beer since the 1990s and DPSG markets Stewarts Root Beer in Canada. The Hires brand is now offered by Canada Dry Motts as an alcoholic drink, Hires Root Beer and Vodka.\n\nHires availability in the U.S. is limited as other Dr. Pepper owned brands like A&W Root Beer are competing for the same bottlers on behalf of the same company.\n\n\n"}

The origin of the dish is unknown. The term frikadeller is German but the dish is associated with not only German but Danish cuisine specifically or Scandinavian cuisine in general. Through cultural exchange, frikadeller have also entered national cuisines of other European countries, such as the Faroe Islands and Norway.\n\nThere are various local variants of frikadeller throughout Scandinavia, as both a main course and a side dish. In Sweden, poached quenelles are called \"frikadeller\".\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. According to the \"Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen,\" it can be found end of the 17th century in German, and is related to the Italian 'frittatella', French 'fricandeau', and Latin 'frīgere' (roast). It may be derived from \"fricandeau de veau\", a dish of sliced veal, larded with pork fat. In the \"Dictionnaire des dictionnaires\" (1837) 'fricadelle' is defined as, \"In Belgium, a ball of minced, cooked meat\" and a separate word, 'fricadèle', is defined as \"fricandeau\". And in \"Phillips's New World of Words\" (1706) \"Fricandoe, a sort of Scotch Collops made of thin slices of Veal, well larded and stuff'd.\" The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines 'fricandele' (variation 'fricadelle\") as a \"quasi-French form of fricandeau\".\n\nFrikadel are also known in Indonesian cuisine through Dutch cuisine (of the frikadel, which is historically similar to the frikadaller) influence and called \"perkedel\", however the main ingredient is not meat, but mashed potato, sometimes slightly mixed with ground meat or corned beef. The mixture is then shaped into flat round patties and dipped in egg yolk before being deep fried. Other than mashed potato, \"cabe rawit\", spring onion, shrimp, peeled corn, or mashed tofu fritters are also common as perkedel ingredients.\n\nIn Denmark, traditionally, they are made from minced veal, pork or beef (or a blend of two of these meats); chopped onions; eggs; milk (or water); bread crumbs (or oatmeal or flour); salt; and pepper; then formed into balls and flattened somewhat. They are then pan-fried in pork fat or beef fat, or more commonly in modern times in butter, margarine or even vegetable oil. Another popular variation is \"fiskefrikadeller\" replacing the meat with fish as the main ingredient and often served with remoulade.\n\nAs a main dish they are most often served with boiled white potatoes and gravy (\"brun sovs\") accompanied by pickled beetroot or cooked red cabbage. Alternatively they can be served with creamed, white cabbage.\n\nFrikadeller are also eaten on rugbrød with red cabbage or pickle slices as a traditional Danish smørrebrød\n\nThe combination of frikadeller and a cold potato salad is very popular at picnics or potlucks, due to the ease of transporting either component after cooking.\n\n"}
{"id": "1012261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1012261", "title": "Frikandel", "text": "Frikandel\n\nA frikandel (; plural frikandellen) is a traditional Dutch snack, a sort of minced-meat hot dog, \nof which the modern version was developed either in 1954 or in 1958/1959. The history of this snack goes back to the 17th century.\n\nThe frikandel is a traditional Dutch and Flemish sausage-shaped meatball. The historical cookbook \"De Verstandige Kok\" (added to the third part of a book series called \"Het Vermakelijk Landleven\") dating 1669 gives 6 different recipes to make a frikadel.\n\nUnlike the modern frika(n)del, the historical frikadel (frickedil) is made from minced veal and generally spiced with mace, nutmeg, salt, pepper and optionally orange peel. A version without egg and breadcrumbs was cooked in a veal net. \n\nThe shape of the frikadel could have been phallic on purpose. The writer P.C. Hooft called 'fricadellen' a receipe for old spinsters. Also, a special version of the frikadel was served to pregnant women, according to 18th century cookery books. It was a veal meatball containing an egg yolk, hidden and sewn into a small leaf of lettuce.\n\nUntil 2005, the official spelling of the name of this sausage in the Dutch language was \"frikadel\", without an \"n\", but both variants are now allowed with \"frikandel\" being the more commonly used version.\n\nThe modern frikandel is a long, firm, skinless, dark-coloured meat sausage which is usually eaten warm. Unlike most sausages, the frikandel is deep-fried. In Belgium and in the north of France it is called a \"frikadel\", \"fricandelle\" or \"fricadelle\". In some parts of Flanders (Belgium), notably around Antwerp, it is called \"curryworst\" (not to be confused with the German Currywurst, though in eastern Germany people tend to eat Currywurst without the skin). In the US it is marketed under the \"Dutch Dawg\" and \"Freakandel\" brands. Due to the absence of a skin, one could argue that technically it is not a sausage.\n\nIn Belgium \"frikadel\" means (also raw) minced pork; it seldom contains other meat. Where the sausage is called \"curryworst\", the term frikadel is often used to describe a sort of meatball (the precursor of the frikandel, with the same meat), commonly eaten in Belgium, Germany and Denmark.\n\nWho created the modern frikandel is contested. Some claimed it was first made by Gerrit de Vries in Dordrecht in 1954, when a law prevented him from selling his product as a meatball. He changed the name and shape instead of the recipe. Others say it was created by Jan Bekkers in Deurne in 1958, and named by him \"frikandel\" after he founded the Beckers factory the following year.\nHowever, the present recipe with very fine mince is derived from Bekker's 1958 version. The de Vries 1954 sausage, named \"fricadelle\", contained chunkier minced meat and essentially was a minced meat patty shaped like a sausage.\n\nIn the Netherlands, northern France, Belgium and Curaçao, the frikandel consists of a mixture of mechanically separated meat, including chicken (40% or more) pork (about 25%). In the US, it contains pork (50%), beef (35%) and non mechanically separated chicken (15%). Some manufacturers also add in a bit of horse meat. A halal version exists and contains only chicken and beef. Other ingredients are bread crumbs, thickener, herbs and spices, onion and flavour enhancers. It is the most popular fast food snack in the Netherlands, followed by \"kroket\". According to the AKSV (the \"General Association of Manufacturers of Cooking Supplies and Snacks\" in the Netherlands) 600 million sausages are produced each year in the Netherlands. Most of these are also sold in the Netherlands, where more than 37 sausages are consumed per capita per year.\n\nIn the Netherlands, it is most often served with curry ketchup or mayonnaise, though some eat it with tomato ketchup, mustard or even apple sauce. Very popular is a frikandel served together with mayonnaise, curry ketchup and chopped raw onion: a \"frikandel speciaal\". The \"frikandel speciaal\" usually has a deep cut lengthwise through the middle to provide room for the chopped onions and the sauces. Some people prefer the taste of a frikandel if the cut is made before frying, resulting in a larger crisp surface. Sometimes the sausage is served on a bun and is then called a \"broodje frikandel\".\n\nIn Belgium and in the north of France, it is served with any sauce of choice and sold in a variety of ways, for example with onions, in a long bun, a piece of baguette, as a kebab or plain and untouched.\n\n\"Frikandellen\" can also be included in party-packs together with other Dutch snacks such as \"bitterballen\", although they are significantly reduced in length. They are also often available in holiday resorts abroad which are popular with the Dutch, such as Lloret de Mar.\n\nIn the Netherlands, \"frikandel\"-eating contests are regularly held all over the country. The record for most \"frikandellen\" consumed in one hour was set in 2005 by Sjonnie Noordeinde of Delft, consuming 47 sausages of 80 grams each.\n\nIn many other countries, including South Africa, Denmark and Germany, \"frikadel\" or \"Frikadelle\" (not to be confused with frikandel) is the local name of minced-meat meatballs or patties like those used in hamburgers.\n\n"}
{"id": "1012633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1012633", "title": "Price dispersion", "text": "Price dispersion\n\nIn economics, price dispersion is variation in prices across sellers of the same item, holding fixed the item's characteristics. Price dispersion can be viewed as a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between price dispersion and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an identical good. Price dispersion, on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs.\n\nPrice dispersion measures include the range of prices, the percentage difference of highest and lowest price, the standard deviation of the price distribution, the variance of the price distribution, and the coefficient of variation of the price distribution.\n\nIn most theoretical literature, price dispersion is argued as result from spatial difference and the existence of significant search cost. With the development of internet and shopping agent programs, conventional wisdom tells that price dispersion should be alleviated and may eventually disappear in the online market due to the reduced search cost for both price and product features. However, recent studies found a surprisingly high level of price dispersion online, even for standardized items such as books, CDs and DVDs. There is some evidence of a shrinking of this online price dispersion, but it remains significant. Recently, work has also been done in the area of e-commerce, specifically the Semantic Web, and its effects on price dispersion.\n\nHal Varian, an economist at U. C. Berkeley, argued in a 1980 article that price dispersion may be an intentional marketing technique to encourage shoppers to explore their options.\n\nA related concept is that of wage dispersion.\n\nEven when consumers search, price dispersion is not guaranteed. Consumers may search, yet firms set the same price, negating the mere fact of searching. This is referred to as Diamond’s paradox. \n\nAssume that many firms provide a homogeneous good. Consumers will randomly sample only one firm if they expect that all firms charge the same price. Consequently, each firm has an equal share of consumers. Since consumers disregard the competitions, each firm acts as a monopoly on its share of consumers. Firms choose a price that maximizes profit: the monopoly price.\n\nA recurrent observation is that some consumers must sample one firm and only one, while the remaining consumers must sample at least two firms.\n\nIf all of them sample only one firm, then the market faces Diamond’s Paradox. Firms would ask the same price, and so there would be no price dispersion.\n\nOn the contrary, if all consumers sample at least two firms. The most expensive firm will not get any consumer, because consumers know at least another firm that is cheaper. As a result, prices must be as low as possible: equal to marginal costs of production, as in a Bertrand economy.\n\nA non-sequential search strategy consists in choosing a number of prices to compare. If consumers follow a non-sequential search strategy, as long as some consumers sample only one firm, then an equilibrium in price dispersion exists.\n\nThere is an equilibrium in price dispersion if some consumers search once, and the remaining consumers search more than one firm. Moreover, the distribution of prices has a closed form if consumers search at most two firms:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2; with formula_3 the share of consumer who sample only one firm, formula_4 consumers' reservation price, and formula_5 firms' marginal costs of production.\n\nSuch an equilibrium in price dispersion occurs when consumers minimize formula_6, with formula_7 the sample size, formula_8 a search cost, and formula_9 the samllest price sampled.\n\nA sequential search strategy consists in sampling prices one by one, and stop after identifying a sufficiently low price. In sequential search models, the existence of perfectly informed consumers guarantees the equilibrium in price dispersion if the remaining consumers search once and only one. There is a continuous relationship between the share of informed consumers and the type of competition: from Bertrand competition to Diamond competition as fewer and fewer consumers are initially perfectly informed.\n\nThe distribution of price has a closed form:\n\nformula_10\n\non support formula_11; where formula_12 the share of perfectly informed consumers, formula_13 the number of firms, formula_14 the revenue function that attains its maximum in formula_15, formula_5 consumers' reservation price, and formula_17\n\n\n"}

It is also often conflated with systems of honorific speech in linguistics, which are grammatical or morphological ways of encoding the relative social status of speakers.\n\nTypically, honorifics are used as a style in the grammatical third person, and as a form of address in the second person. Use in the first person, by the honored dignitary, is uncommon or considered very rude and egotistical. Some languages have anti-honorific (\"despective\" or \"humilific\") first person forms (expressions such as \"your most humble servant\" or \"this unworthy person\") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded to the person addressed.\n\nThe most common honorifics in modern English are usually placed immediately before a person's name. Honorifics which can be used (both as style and as form of address) include, in the case of a man, \"Mr\" (irrespective of marital status), and in the case of a woman the honorific may depend on her marital status: if she is unmarried, it is \"Miss\", if she has been married it is \"Mrs\", and if her marital status is unknown, or it is not desired to specify it, \"Ms\". Someone who does not want to express a gender with their honorific may occasionally use Mx, Ind. or Misc.. \n\nIn the U.S., these terms are styled with a period (\"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\") because they were originally abbreviations (of \"Mister\" and \"Mistress\"). \"Ms.\" is also styled with a period for consistency. In Great Britain, periods are typically not used.\n\nOther honorifics may denote the honored person's occupation, for instance \"Doctor\", \"Esquire\", \"Captain\", \"Coach\", \"Officer\", \"The Reverend\" for all clergy or \"Father\" (for a Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Anglican Christian priest), \"Rabbi\" for Jewish clergy, or Professor. Holders of an academic Doctorate such as PhD are addressed as \"Doctor\" (abbreviated Dr). \"Master\" as a prefix ahead of the name of boys and young men up to about 16 years of age is less common than it used to be, but is still used by older people addressing the young in formal situations and correspondence.\n\nSome honorifics act as complete replacements for a name, as \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am\", or \"Your Honor\". Subordinates will often use honorifics as punctuation before asking a superior a question or after responding to an order: \"Yes, sir\" or even \"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\nJudges are often addressed as \"Your Honor\" (or \"Honour\" in Commonwealth jurisdictions) when on the bench, and the style (in the United States) is \"His/Her Honor\" the plural form is \"Your Honors\". If the judge also has a higher title, that may be the correct honorific to use, for example, in Britain: \"Your Lordship\". Judges on the U.S. Supreme Court are addressed as \"Justice\".\n\nSimilarly, a monarch (ranking as a king/queen or emperor) and his/her consort may be addressed or referred to as \"Your/His/Her Majesty\", \"Their Majesties\", etc. (but there is no customary honorific accorded to a female monarch's consort, as he is usually granted a specific style). Monarchs below kingly rank are addressed as \"Your/His/Her Highness\", the exact rank being indicated by an appropriate modifier, e.g. \"His Serene Highness\" for a member of a princely dynasty, or \"Her Grand Ducal Highness\" for a member of a family that reigns over a grand duchy. Verbs with these honorifics as subject are conjugated in the third person (e.g. \"you are going\" vs. \"Your Honor is going\" or \"Her Royal Highness is going\".) Protocol for monarchs and aristocrats can be very complex, with no general rule; great offence can be given by using a form that is not exactly correct. There are differences between \"Your Highness\" and \"Your Royal Highness\"; between \"Princess Margaret\" and \"The Princess Margaret\". All of these are correct, but apply to people of subtly different rank. An example of a non-obvious style is \"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\", which was an official style, but unique to one person.\n\nIn music, a distinguished conductor or virtuoso instrumentalist may be known as \"Maestro\".\n\nIn aviation, pilots in command of a larger civil aircraft are usually addressed as \"Captain\" plus their full name or surname. This tradition is slowly diminishing in the United States and most EU countries. However, many countries, especially in Asia, follow this tradition and address airline pilots, military pilots, and flight instructors exclusively as \"Captain\" even outside of the professional environment. In addition, such countries' etiquette rules dictate that this title must be placed on all the official letters and social invitations, business cards, identification documents, etc. In the United States, when addressing a pilot, common etiquette does not require the title \"Captain\" to be printed on official letters or invitations before the addressee's full name. However, this is optional (akin to \"Esq\" after an attorney's name, in the U.S.) and may be used where appropriate, especially when addressing airline pilots with many years of experience.\n\nOccupants of state and political office may be addressed with an honorific. A monarch may be addressed as His/Her Majesty, a president as Your Excellency or Mr/Madam President, a minister or secretary of state as \"Your Excellency\" or Mr/Madam Secretary, etc. A prime minister may be addressed as \"the Honorable\". In the UK, members of the Privy Council are addressed as \"the Right Honourable ...\". A member of Parliament or other legislative body may have particular honorifics. A member of a Senate, for example, may be addressed as \"Senator\". The etiquette varies and most countries have protocol specifying the honorifics to be used for its state, judicial, military and other officeholders.\n\nFormer military officers are sometimes addressed by their last military rank, such as \"Captain\", \"Colonel\", \"General\", etc. This is generally only adopted by those officers who served in at least the rank equivalent of Major.\n\nIn areas of East Africa, where the Bantu language Swahili is spoken, \"mzee\" is frequently used for an elder to denote respect by younger speakers. It is used in direct conversation and used in referring to someone in the third person.\n\nWhile Swahili is Bantu, it is highly influenced by Arabic and Hindi languages and cultures. \"Babu\" is a prefix honorific used with elders, similar to \"mzee\", but may also mean grandfather. Other prefix honorifics are \"ndugu\", for brother or a close male friend, and \"dada\" for a sister or close female friend; thus, John and Jane would be Ndugu John and Dada Jane, respectively.\n\nAmongst the Akan ethnic groups of West Africa's Ghana, the word \"nana\" is used as an aristocratic pre-nominal by chiefs and elders alike.\n\nIn Yorubaland, also in West Africa, the word \"ogbeni\" is used as a synonym for the English \"mister\". Titled members of the region's aristocracy are therefore called \"oloye\" instead, this being the word for \"chief\". Although the former of the two titles is only used by men, aristocrats of either gender are addressed using the latter of them.\n\nSome honorifics used by Ancient Romans, such as Augustus, turned into titles over time.\n\nDuring the ancient and imperial periods, Chinese honorifics varied greatly based on one's social status, but with the end of Imperial China, many of these distinctions fell out of colloquial use. Some honorifics remain in use today, especially in formal writings for the court and business settings.\n\nIn addition, the use of honorifics varies greatly across Chinese-speaking regions in the world. In Taiwan, for example, honorifics are more widely used in daily interactions. In Mainland China, however, honorifics tend to recede to formal settings.\n\nIndian honorifics abound, covering formal and informal relationships for commercial, generational, social, and spiritual links. Honorifics may be prefix, suffix, or replacement types. There are many variations.\n\n\nItalian honorifics are usually limited to formal situations. Professional titles like \"Ingegnere\" (engineer) are often substituted for the ordinary \"Signore\" (mister), while \"Dottore\" (doctor) is used very freely for any graduate of a university.\nHonorifics lose their \"e\" ending when juxtaposed to a surname: e.g., dottor Rossi, cardinal Martini, ragionier Fantozzi.\nPeople in high religious positions, such as the Pope or cardinals, are addressed as \"Sua Santità Cardinal/Papa\" (His holiness Cardinal/Pope).\n\nThe word in Japanese for honorifics, , is used in Japanese everyday conversations. Japanese honorifics are similar to English, with titles like \"Mister\" and \"Miss\", but in Japanese, which has many honorifics, their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Japanese grammar, as a whole, tends to function on hierarchy; honorific stems are appended to verbs and many nouns, primarily names, and in many cases one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb- or noun-meaning, but with different honorific connotations.\n\nIn Japan, there are three rough divisions of honorifics:\n\n\nIndonesia's Javanese majority ethnicity has many honorifics. For example:\n\n\nKorean honorifics are similar to Japanese honorifics, and similarly, their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Korean grammar as a whole tends to function on hierarchy; honorific stems are appended to verbs and some nouns, and in many cases, one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb- or noun-meaning, but with different honorific connotations. Linguists say that there are six levels of honorifics in Korean but, in daily conversation, only four of them are widely used in contemporary Korean. Suffix -si-(시) is used at most honorific verbs, but not always. It is considered very impolite and offensive not to use honorific sentences or words with someone who is older or has a higher social status, and most Koreans avoid using non-honorific sentences with someone they have met for the first time. In Korean, names, first or last, always precede a title, e.g., Park Sonsaengnim, Park Kwanjangnim, etc.\n\nA complex system of Titles and honorifics is extensively used in the Malay language-speaking cultures in Brunei and Malaysia. In contrast Singapore, whose Malay royalty was abolished by the British colonial government in 1891, has adopted civic titles for its leaders.\n\nPakistan has numerous honorific forms that may be used with or as a substitute for names. The most common honorifics in Pakistan are usually placed immediately before the name of the subject or immediately after the subject. There are many variations across Pakistan.\n\nPersian honorifics generally follow the second name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g., Name Agha [Mr.], Name Khanom [Ms.], Name Ostad [teacher or cleric], Name Rayis [manager, leader or director]). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A more formal honorific referring to gender would be \"Jenab\" [His Excellency], which preceds Name Agha [Mr.] and \"Sarkar\" [Her Excellency], which precedes Name Khanom [Ms.]. A newer honorific is \"Arjomand\" [esteemed], which comes after other honorifics (except those referring to gender), and is not gender-specific (e.g., Ostad Arjomand Name Surname, or Rayis Arjomand Sarkar Khanom Name Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations.\n\nThe usage of Filipino honorifics differs from person to person, though commonalities occur like the occasional insertion of the word \"po\" or \"ho\" in conversations, and their dependence on age-structured hierarchies. Though some have become obsolete, many are still widely used in order to denote respect, friendliness, or affection. Some new \"honorifics\", mainly used by teenagers, are experiencing surges in popularity.\n\nThe Tagalog language has honorifics like \"Binibini/Ate\" (\"Miss\", \"Big sister\"), \"Ginang/Aling/Manang\" (“Mrs.”, \"Madam\"), \"Ginoo/Mang/Manong/Kuya\" (\"Mister\", \"Sir\", \"Big brother\") that have roots in Chinese culture.\n\nDepending on one's relation with the party being addressed, various honorifics may be used.\n\nAs such addressing a man who is older, has a higher rank at work or has a higher social standing, one may use Mr or Sir followed by the First/ last/ or full name.\nAddressing a woman in a similar situation as above one may use “Miss”, or “Madam” and its contraction “Ma'am”, followed by First/ last/ or full name. Older married women may prefer to be addressed as “Mrs.”\nThe use of Sir/Miss/Madam or Ma’am, followed by the first name, nickname, or surname is usually restricted to Filipino vernacular and social conversation, even in television and film. Despite this, non-Filipinos and naturalized Filipinos (such as expat students and professionals) also address older people in the Filipino way.\n\nOn a professional level, many use educational or occupational titles such as Architect, Engineer, Doctor, Attorney (often abbreviated as Arch./Archt./Ar., Engr., Dr. [or sometimes Dra. for female doctors], and Atty. respectively) on casual and even formal bases. Stricter etiquette systems frown upon this practise as a sign of Filipino professionals' obsession with flaunting their educational attainment and professional status. Despite this, some of their clients (especially non-Filipinos) would address them as simply Mr. or Mrs./Ms. followed by their surnames (or even Sir/Ma'am) in conversation. It is very rare, however, for a Filipino (especially those born and educated abroad) to address Filipino architects, engineers, and lawyers, even mentioning and referring to their names, the non-Philippine (i.e. international standard) way.\n\nEven foreigners who work in the Philippines or naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions (especially as instructors in Philippine colleges and universities) are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some language purists who argue that the basic titles or either \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am/Madam\" are to be employed for simplicity, as they are unnecessary when he or she is included in a list of wedding sponsors, or when his or her name appears in the list of officials of a country club or similar organization. They are uncalled for in public donations, religious activities, parents-teachers association events, athletic competitions, society pages of newspapers, and in any activity that has nothing to do with one’s title or educational attainment. It is also acceptable to treat those titles and descriptions (except \"Doctor\") as adjectival nouns (i.e., first letter not capitalized, e.g. \"architect\" <name>) instead.\n\nEven though Doctor is really a title in standard English, the \"created\" titles Architect, Attorney, and Engineer (among other examples) are a result of vanity (titles herald achievement and success; they distinguish the title holder from the rest of society) and insecurity (the title holder's achievements and successes might be ignored unless announced to the public), even due to historical usage of pseudo-titles in newspapers when Filipinos first began writing in English.\n\nPossible reasons are firstly, the fact the English taught to Filipinos was the “egalitarian” English of the New World, and that the Americans who colonized the Philippines encountered lowland societies that already used Iberian linguistic class markers like \"Don\" and \"Doña.\" Secondly, the fundamental contradiction of the American colonial project. The Americans who occupied the Philippines justified their actions through the rhetoric of \"benevolent assimilation\". In other words, they were only subjugating Filipinos to teach them values like American egalitarianism, which is the opposite of colonial anti-equality. Thirdly, the power of American colonialism lays in its emphasis on education – an education that supposedly exposed Filipinos to the \"wonders\" of the American way of life. Through education, the American colonial state bred a new elite of Filipinos trained in a new, more \"modern\", American system. People with advanced degrees like law or engineering were at the apex of this system. Their prestige, as such, not only rested on their purported intelligence, but also their mastery of the colonizer’s way of life. This, Lisandro Claudio suspects, is the source of the magical and superstitious attachment Filipinos have to attorneys, architects and engineers. The language they use is still haunted by their colonial experience. They linguistically privilege professionals because their colonizers made us value a certain kind of white-collar work. Again, even expatriate professionals in the Philippines were affected by these reasons when they resided and married a Filipino or were naturalized so it's not unusual for them to be addressed Filipino style.\n\nSpanish has a number of honorific forms that may be used with or as substitutes for names, such as \"señor\" or \"caballero\" (\"Mr.\", \"Sir\", \"Gentleman\"); \"señora\" (\"Madam\", \"Mrs.\", \"Lady\", \"ma'am\") and \"señorita\" (\"Miss\", \"young lady\"); \"licenciado\" for a person with bachelor's or a professional degree (e.g., attorneys and engineers); \"maestro\" for a teacher, master mechanic, or person with a master's degree; \"doctor\" (\"doctor\"); etc. Also used is \"don\" (male) or \"doña\" (female) for people of rank or, in some Latin American countries (e.g., Puerto Rico), for any senior citizen. In some Latin American countries, like Colombia, \"Doctor\" is used for any respected figure regardless of whether they have a doctoral degree (for instance Colombian presidents are often referred to as Doctor ___); likewise \"Maestro\" is used for artistic masters, especially painters.\n\nAdditionally, older people and those with whom one would speak respectfully (e.g., one's boss or teacher), are often addressed as \"usted,\" abbreviated \"ud.\", a formal/respectful way of saying \"you\" (e.g. \"Dra. Polo, ¿cómo está usted?\" Dr. Polo, how are you?). The word \"usted\" historically comes from the honorific title \"vuestra merced\" (literally \"your mercy\"). This formal you is accompanied by verb conjugation that is different from the informal you \"tú\". Intimate friends and relatives are addressed as \"tú\". In some regions, addressing a relative stranger as \"tú\" can be considered disrespectful or provocative, except when it's directed to a person notably younger than the speaker, or in an especially informal context.\n\nPingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese does not employ many honorifics into their speech. Their society is structured in a way that everyone is seen as equal, most likely due to the fact that there are so few of them due to emigration. There is no structured hierarchy to enforce the use of honorific speech. There are not many polite vocabulary words and the language they use can be classified as a commoners’ language.\n\nHowever, among the Micronesian languages, Pohnpeian is the only language that uses a thoroughly developed honorific speech. This demonstrates that a highly structured hierarchical society was very important in their culture. There are multiple ways that Pohnpeic speakers show respect through their language. In the Pohnpeic language there is royal language, which is used for the two highest-ranking chiefs. Next, respect honorifics are used with other superiors and people who are considered respected equals. There is not only the use of honorifics, but humiliative language as well, which is used to lower oneself below higher-ranking people, showing respect and reverence. This speech was lost in Pingelap when Pohnpei speakers migrated to the Pingelap atoll and adapted their more casual way of speaking.\n\nEven though the younger generation of Pingelapese speakers does not use honorific speech, elders in the language report being taught a form of ‘language of respect.’ This language was to be used to address elders and leaders in the community. Women were also told to use it towards their brothers and with their children. Phrases could be made polite by adding the second person singular possessive suffix –\"mwi\". Other ways to utilize honorific speech is by changing words entirely.\n\nThe most common honorifics used in Thailand are used to differentiate age between friends, family and peers. \nThe following represent some of the most commonly used.\n\nคุณ (khoon)(Middle Tone) is used the same way as Mr / Mrs or Miss. It is a formal way to refer to persons not overly familiar. It is also used as a pronoun for the word \"You\"\n\nพี่ (Pee)(Falling Tone) is used when speaking to or about an older sibling or friend. It is used for both men and women and can also be used when referring to oneself if they are older than the addressee(s)\n\nน้อง(Naawng)(High Tone) is the exact opposite of the above. It is use when speaking to or about a younger sibling or friend. It is used between both men and women and can also be used when referring to oneself if the person speaking is younger than the addressee(s).\n\nครู (Khruu)(Middle Tone) is used when addressing a teacher, translating literally to \"Teacher\".\n\nอาจารย์ (Aah-jarhn)(Middle Tone both syllables) is used to address a professor. It is used much in the same way as Khruu however Aa-jarhn holds a little more esteem. It generlly refers to someone who is a master in their field. Many Theravada Buddhist scholars and those who have dedicated their lives to Theravada Buddhism assume this title amongst their followers.\n\nพระ (Prah)(High Tone) This is perhaps one of the highest honorifics in Thai culture. It is reserved for monks and priests. It is also allows for use when referring to a most revered place or object such as a temple or palace.\n\nTurkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Name Bey [Mr.], Name Hanım [Ms.], Name Beyefendi [literally meaning \"Lord Master\"], Name Hanımefendi [literally meaning \"Lady Master\"], Name Hoca [teacher or cleric], Name Öğretmen [solely for teacher]). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. Another honorific is \"Sayın\"/Muhterem [esteemed], which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayın/Muhterem Name Surname, or Sayın/Muhterem Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations.\n\nHonorifics in Vietnamese are more complex compared to Chinese, where the origins of many of these pronouns can be traced, and many have fallen out of usage or have been replaced due to the changing times. An honorific, or a pronoun, in Vietnamese when referring to a person acts as a way to define two peoples' degree of relationship with one another. Examples of these pronouns include 'chị' older sister, 'ông' male elder and 'chú' younger uncle (younger brother of father/only used on father's side). The exclusive use of the Vietnamese words for 'I' and 'you' are considered informal and rude. Rather honorifics are used to refer to oneself and to others. These terms generally differ from province to province, or region to region. As with East Asian tradition, the surname is written prior to the given name (i.e., Hoang Khai Dinh: Hoang is the surname and Khai Dinh is the given name). This occurs in all formal situations. However, placing the surname last has become a commonality in order to cater to westerners, for example, on social media sites such as Facebook. When referring to a person as Mr or Mrs (teacher, painter, etc.) as in the English tradition of 'Mr Hoang', the given name is more commonly used e.g., \"Mr Khai Dinh\") in order not to cause confusion. This is due to many Vietnamese sharing the same surname (e.g., up to 40% of Vietnamese share the surname Nguyen).\n\nWuvulu-Aua does not normally incorporate honorifics as it is reserved for only the utmost respect. Originally without any honorifics, the semantics of pronouns change depending on the social context. In particular, the second person dual pronoun is used as an honorific address. The dual reference communicates that the second person is to be respected as two people. This honorific is typically reserved for in-laws. It is undocumented if any other honorifics exist beyond this one.\n\n\nPeople who have a strong sense of egalitarianism, such as Quakers and certain socialists, and others, eschew honorific titles. When addressing or referring to someone, they often use the person's name, an informal pronoun, or some other style implying social equality, such as \"brother\", \"sister\", \"friend\", or \"comrade\". This was also the practice in Revolutionary France and socialist countries which used \"Citoyen[ne]\" (\"Citizen\") as the manner of address.\n\nFeminist criticism of the use of separate honorifics for married and unmarried women (Mrs. and Miss) has led to some women's adopting the honorific \"Ms.\" In modern United States culture, it is considered rude to assume someone is married and address them as Mrs. \n\nThe all-inclusionary honorific Mx has been adopted by some, particularly in the UK, applying to any human regardless of gender, occupation, rank, social status, or other social/cultural factors.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n"}

Allen. In 1922, Allen partnered with Frank Wright. They combined their initials to create the brand \"A&W\" and inspired a restaurant chain, founded in 1922. Originally, A&W root beer drinks sold for five cents.\n\nOutside Canada, the rights to the A&W brand are owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, which in turn licenses the brand to the similarly named U.S.-based restaurant chain; A&W products are distributed via various U.S. bottlers. A&W Food Services of Canada, which is independent of both Keurig Dr Pepper and the U.S. chain, is responsible for the restaurants and the marketing of root beer products in that country, with retail products bottled and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company. The U.S. variant is also sold as an import drink in Southeast Asia and Italy (where A&W has restaurants), as well as Australia, and Chile, among other countries.\n\nOn June 20, 1919, Roy W. Allen opened a roadside root beer stand in Lodi, California, using a formula he had purchased from a pharmacist. He soon opened stands in Stockton, California, and five stands in nearby Sacramento, home of the country's first drive-in featuring \"tray-boys\" for curbside service. In 1920, Allen became partners with Frank Wright and the two combined their initials and called their product A&W Root Beer. A mistaken notion is that the initials were derived from Alice and Willard Marriott. This mistake arose owing to Marriott's first business, an A&W franchise\n\nIn 1924, Allen bought Wright's share, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant franchises. A&W was one of the first franchised restaurant chains in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. By 1933, there were more than 170 A&W franchised outlets. There was no common menu, architecture, or procedures shared by the franchisees and some chose to sell food with the root beer.\n\nFranchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during World War II, but following the war, the number of A&W outlets tripled as GI loans paved the way for private enterprise. Driven by the popularity of the automobile and the new mobile society, more than 450 A&W Root Beer stands were operating by 1950. In that same year, Allen retired and sold the business to Nebraskan Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&W Root Beer Company. The first A&W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.\n\nBy 1960, the number of A&W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000. In 1963, the A&W Root Beer Company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen's concentrate since 1921. In the same year, the first overseas A&W restaurant opened its doors in Guam.\n\nIn 1963, the company was sold to the United Fruit Company, then renamed the United Brands Company. In 1971, United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&W Distributing Co., for the purpose of making A&W Root Beer available in bottles on the grocery shelf. After a test run in Arizona and California, the products were distributed nationally in the United States, along with sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&W introduced \"The Great Root Bear,\" a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.\n\nIn the late 1970s, A&W Restaurants was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by A. Alfred Taubman.\n\nIn 1986, A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of sugar-free A&W as Diet A&W.\n\nIn October 1993, A&W Beverages was folded into Cadbury Beverages. That company would spin off its US beverages business as Keurig Dr Pepper in 2008.\n\nIn March 2005, A&W began to appear in the Vintage Bottle, a 20-ounce bottle with graphics reminiscent of an old fashioned root beer barrel. The brand's current tagline is, \"Classic American Refreshment Since 1919.\"\n\nIn July 2017, A&W Canada reformulated its root beer, dropping High Fructose Corn Syrup and some flavors from the recipe, substituting cane sugar, sarsaparilla root, licorice, birch bark, and anise. They launched the new formula by declaring Free Root Beer Day, serving free A&W Root Beer at all locations across the country from open to close on Saturday July 22, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe Great Root Bear, also called Rooty, is the mascot for A&W Root Beer. It was first used in 1974 by Canada's \"A&W\", and was adopted by the American chain in 1976. In a long-running television advertising campaign for the Canadian A&W chain, his theme was a tuba-driven jingle entitled \"Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum\" and released as a single by Attic Records in Canada, credited to \"Major Ursus\", a play on the constellation name Ursa Major, which means \"great bear\". In the late 1990s, the Great Root Bear's role as mascot was reduced for the restaurant chain, ultimately replaced by \"The Burger Family\", although it still appeared in various capacities for the restaurants and on A&W Root Beer cases in Canada. In late 2011, the new ownership of A&W began using the mascot again, particularly in A&W's online presence.\n\nShortly after Allen bought out Wright's portion of the business, he began franchising the product. His profits came from a small franchise fee and sales of concentrate. There was no standard food menu for franchises until 1978. By 1960, they had 2,000 stores.\n\nIn 1989, A&W made an agreement with Minnesota-based chain Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain's 200 locations (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to \"A&W Hot Dogs & More\". Some A&W Hot Dogs & More locations are in operation today.\n\nMany A&W locations that opened in the U.S. during the Yum! Brands ownership years (2002–2011) were co-branded with Yum!'s other chains—Long John Silver's, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, or KFC.\n\nAs of December 2011, A&W was bought by new ownership and their World Headquarters moved back to Lexington, Kentucky. Since then, in the United States and Southeast Asia, A&W has been a franchisee-owned company.\n\n"}
{"id": "1015431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1015431", "title": "A&amp;W Cream Soda", "text": "A&amp;W Cream Soda\n\nA&W Cream Soda is a cream soda carbonated soft drink introduced by A&W Root Beer in 1986. A&W Root Beer was first sold at a Veterans Day parade in Lodi, California in 1919 and the company established in 1922 by Frank Wright and Roy Allen. The first product they created was A & W Root Beer. It was not until 1986 that A&W Brands, headquartered in White Plains, N.Y. introduced A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda through its network of franchised bottlers and distributors. Although cream soda had been created in 1852 by E.M. Sheldon, A&W Brands was one of the first American companies to make it commercially. In 1993, A&W Brands was purchased by Cadbury/Schweppes, and in 1995 Cadbury/Schweppes purchased the Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Company, which made A&W a part of the Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. In 2001, DPSU purchased the Snapple Beverage Group (formally TriArc Beverages), and moved the New York-based company operations to its new headquarters in Plano, Texas. This acquisition put A&W within the same company as the top soda brand companies and made A&W Cream Soda the top brand in cream sodas.\n\nIn 2017, the product was reformulated to be caffeine free.\n\nIn 1991, A&W had its most popular cream soda campaign. They produced a summer advertisement with Snoopy and Woodstock displayed on the entire can. Snoopy and Woodstock are characters from the Peanuts Gang comic strips written by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy can be seen playing baseball, having a cookout, lifting weights, surfing, walking the beach, riding a bike, jumping hurdles, and listening to music. These cans were very popular among buyers. These images can be seen on regular A&W cream soda as well as Diet A&W cream soda cans.\n\nCoca-Cola’s first polar bear print advertisement made its debut in France in 1922, and for the next 70 years, polar bears appeared sporadically in print advertising. A&W, the leading root beer marketer, filmed their own commercial using polar bears in the summer of 1992. In that commercial, a real polar bear is seen in contrast to a mechanical polar bear that is ice-skating in a fancy skirt. The commercial used the polar bears to distinguish a difference between regular A&W cream soda and sparkling A&W cream soda. They use the real bear yawning to embody the regular cream soda, and they use the ice-skating polar bear to represent the sparkling cream soda. The polar bears are used as a marketing technique to appeal to a large audience. \"They are white, which is the color of innocence, even though in this case it's 800 pounds of skin-ripping innocence,\" Mr. Gilbert said.\n\nAlso, in 1992 Pepsi-Cola International and A&W Brands Inc. worked together over a signed agreement to increase the spread of A&W's bottled products in Asia. The company anticipated to sell $500,000,000 of A & W soft drinks in Asia within the span of ten years to make the company's brands as prevalent as Pepsi, which was already distributed in Guam and Indonesia. In 1994, A&W put $7,000,000 into their marketing promotions. They partnered with the show \"Baywatch\" to produce greater sales for their product. Baywatch was ranked second among all of the popular TV shows, so they knew this was a great opportunity. In-show placement on four episodes of \"Baywatch\" appeared. The advertisement was shown as sponsors of a boogie board test during the episode. The winner of the boogie board contest on the television show would receive a year's supply of A&W.\n\nA&W cream soda also spent $1.5 million in ads commemorating \"a little sparkle in a vanilla world.\" A new A&W campaign from New York, which featured regular people, kids to grandparents, all describing their satisfaction of A&W. The campaign took a different direction from A&W's common and past humorous ads, using sepia-toned images. Their new tag-line introduced: “authentic.” \n\nIn addition to making A&W well known in different countries, using Snoopy, making new marketing campaigns with polar bears, and using the show \"Baywatch\", A&W cream soda has had a few commercials. Joe Isuzu appeared in cream soda commercials as well as William Sanderson and the Sumangala Band.\n\nServing size: 12 fl. oz.

It was originally made with Bourgogne Aligoté, a white wine of Burgundy. Now, various white wines are used throughout France, according to the region and the whim of the barkeeper. Many prefer a white Chardonnay-based Burgundy, such as Chablis.\n\nIt used to be called blanc-cassis, but it is now named after Félix Kir (1876–1968), mayor of Dijon in Burgundy. Kir was a pioneer of the twinning movement in the aftermath of the Second World War, and popularized the drink by offering it at receptions to visiting delegations. Besides treating his international guests well, he was also promoting two economic products of the region. Kir allowed one of Dijon's producers of crème de cassis to use his name, then extended the right to their competitors as well. According to Rolland (2004), the reinvention of blanc-cassis (post 1945) was necessitated by the German Army's confiscation of all the local red Burgundy during the war. Faced with an excess of white wine, Kir renovated a drink that used to be made primarily with the red.\n\nAnother explanation that has been offered is that Mayor Kir revived it during a year in which the ordinary white wine of the region was inferior and the creme de cassis helped to disguise the fact.\n\nFollowing the commercial development of crème de cassis in 1841, the cocktail became a popular regional café drink, but has since become inextricably linked internationally with the name of Mayor Kir. When ordering a kir, waiters in France sometimes ask whether the customer wants it made with crème de cassis (blackcurrant), de mûre (blackberry), de pêche (peach), or framboise (raspberry).\n\nThe International Bartenders Association gives a recipe using 1/10 crème de cassis, but French sources typically specify more; 19th-century recipes for blanc-cassis recommended 1/3 crème de cassis, which modern tastes find cloyingly sweet, and modern sources typically about 1/5. Replacing the crème de cassis with blackcurrant syrup is discouraged.\n\nBesides the basic Kir, a number of variations exist:\n\n"}

In many cases artivists attempt to push political agendas by the means of art, but a focus on raising social, environmental, and technical awareness is also common. Besides using traditional mediums like film and music to raise awareness or push for change, an artivist can also be involved in culture jamming, subvertising, street art, spoken word, protesting, and activism.\n\nArtivist Eve Ensler stated:\n...

Sometimes called balms or heat rubs, liniments are of a similar or greater viscosity than lotions and are rubbed in to create friction, unlike lotions, ointments or creams, but patches, sticks and sprays are also available.\n\nLiniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscular aches and strains, or arthritis. These are typically formulated from alcohol, acetone, or similar quickly evaporating solvents and contain counterirritant aromatic chemical compounds such as methyl salicilate, benzoin resin, menthol, or capsaicin. They produce a feeling of warmth within the muscle of the area they are applied to, typically acting as rubefacients via a counterirritant effect.\nThe methyl salicylate that is the active analgesic ingredient in some heat-rub products can be toxic if they are used in excess. Heating pads are also not recommended for use with heat rubs, as the added warmth may cause overabsorption of the active ingredients.\n\n\nLiniments are commonly used on horses following exercise, applied either by rubbing on full-strength, especially on the legs; or applied in a diluted form, usually added to a bucket of water and sponged on the body. They are used in hot weather to help cool down a horse after working, the alcohol cooling through rapid evaporation, and counterirritant oils dilating capillaries in the skin, increasing the amount of blood releasing heat from the body.\n\nMany horse liniment formulas in diluted form have been used on humans, though products for horses which contain DMSO are not suitable for human use, as DMSO carries the topical product into the bloodstream. Horse liniment ingredients such as menthol, chloroxylenol, or iodine are also used in different formulas in products used by humans.\n\nAbsorbine, a horse liniment product manufactured by W.F. Young, Inc., was reformulated for humans and marketed as Absorbine Jr. The company also acquired other liniment brands including Bigeloil and RefreshMint. The equine version of Absorbine is sometimes used by humans, though its benefits in humans may be because the smell of menthol releases serotonin, or due to a placebo effect.\n\nEarl Sloan was a US entrepreneur who made his initial fortune selling his father's horse liniment formula beginning in the period following the Civil War. Sloan's liniment, with capsicum as a key ingredient, was also marketed for human use. He later sold his company to the predecessor of Warner–Lambert, which was purchased in 2000 by Pfizer.\n"}

LaRouche ran for president on eight consecutive occasions, a record for any candidate, and has tied Harold Stassen's record as a perennial candidate. LaRouche ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States seven times, beginning in 1980. His current Political Action Committee is called \"LaRouche PAC.\"\n\nIn 1971 LaRouche founded the U.S. Labor Party as a vehicle for electoral politics. In 1976 he ran for President of the United States as the U.S. Labor Party candidate, polling 40,043 votes (0.05%). According to LaRouche supporters, the major accomplishment of the campaign was the broadcast of a paid half-hour television address, which gave LaRouche the opportunity to air his views before a national audience. This was to become a regular feature of later campaigns during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHis platform included a reference to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller: \"Impeach Rocky to prevent imminent nuclear war\".\n\nSince the autumn of 1979, LaRouche resigned from the U.S. Labor Party and founded the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee whose name drew complaints from the Democratic National Committee, who saw these efforts as infiltration.\n\nLaRouche budgeted $150,000 for the first primary state, New Hampshire. That included air time on TV stations in overlapping markets such as Maine and Vermont, along with 1,928 radio advertisements on New Hampshire radio. LaRouche reportedly spent $4,000 on a half-hour broadcast on WBZ, and a total of $24,200 on all TV spots in the state.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee asserted that LaRouche is not a Democrat, but the U.S. electoral system made it impossible for the party to prevent LaRouche followers entering Democratic primaries. LaRouche himself polled negligible vote totals, but continued to promote himself as a serious political candidate, a claim which was sometimes accepted by elements of the media and some political figures.\n\nIndependent Democrats for LaRouche, a committee formed for the 1984 election, was found guilty in 1988 of soliciting loans in violation of Minnesota securities law, and was ordered to stop selling unregistered Securities.\n\nIn 1988 LaRouche and running mate Debra Hanania Freeman received 25,082 votes, or 0.03% of the vote.\n\nIn 1992, LaRouche became the second person in U.S. history (after Eugene Debs) to run for president from a prison cellalthough Debs was generally considered a serious candidate and was in jail for his political beliefs (against World War I) rather than for fraud. LaRouche's supporters argue that he was, in fact, in jail for his political beliefs (see LaRouche criminal trials). Classical violinist Norbert Brainin performed a benefit concert on his behalf in Washington, D.C.; the \"Washington Post\" reviewer praised his musicianship while condemning his political message. LaRouche's running mate, who did the active campaigning, was the American Civil Rights Movement leader, Reverend James Bevel.\n\nPrior to the primaries the Chair of the Democratic National Party, Don Fowler, ruled that LaRouche \"is not to be considered a qualified candidate for nomination of the Democratic Party for President\" on account of LaRouche's \"expressed political beliefs, including beliefs which are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic, and otherwise utterly contrary to the fundamental beliefs ... of the Democratic Party and ... on his past activities including exploitation of and defrauding contributors and voters.\" In subsequent primaries LaRouche received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state. When the state parties refused to award the delegates LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the Voting Rights Act. After losing in the district court the case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeals, which sustained the lower court.\n\nIn 1999, however, a court ruled that the Democratic National Committee had the right to keep LaRouche from electing delegates to the Democratic National Convention, based on a party requirement that a Democratic nominee must be a registered voter. LaRouche, as a convicted felon, is not eligible to be a registered voter in the state of Virginia, where he lives. \"(see United States v. LaRouche)\"\n\nA routine FEC audit of the 2000 \"LaRouche's Committee for a New Bretton Woods\" campaign found that vendors whose sole client was Lyndon LaRouche had added unqualified \"mark-up charges\" to the bill submitted for matching funds. The vendors were American System Publications, Inc., Eastern States Distributors, Inc., EIR News Services, Inc., Hamilton Systems Distributors, Inc., Mid-West Circulation Corp., Southeast Literature Sales, Inc., and Southwest Literature Distributors, Inc. They had overbilled by $241,519 and the campaign was ordered to repay $222,034. The FEC decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nLaRouche qualified to win six delegates in the Arkansas Democratic primary. A minimum of 15% vote was required and LaRouche took 22%. However, the Democratic Party refused to grant him delegates because he was ineligible to vote.\n\nHe waged a campaign, begun in October 2002, to have Dick Cheney dumped from the Republican ticket.\n\nAgain, LaRouche gained negligible electoral support. However, according to Federal Election Commission statistics, LaRouche had more individual contributors to his 2004 presidential campaign than any other candidate, until the final quarter of the primary season, when John Kerry surpassed him. As of the April 15 filing, LaRouche had 7834 individual contributions, of those who have given cumulatively, $200 or more, as compared to 6257 for John Kerry, 5582 for John Edwards, 4090 for Howard Dean, and 2744 for Gephardt.\n\nHe ran even though his home state of Virginia is one of a handful of states which still has lifetime denial of the vote to felons, which can be overturned only on appeal to the governor. (Neither the Constitution nor federal statute law requires presidents to be registered voters.) The Democratic Party did not consider his candidacy to be legitimate and ruled him ineligible to win delegates. He gained negligible electoral support. He was endorsed by two Democratic state representatives, Erik Fleming of Mississippi and Harold James of Pennsylvania, though Fleming later called the endorsement \"the worst mistake of all.\" LaRouche was not one of the major candidates invited to the primary-season debates, although he did participate in some alternative forums for minor candidates.\n\nLaRouche was present in Boston during the 2004 Democratic National Convention but did not attend the convention itself. His followers sang songs insulting Democratic nominee John Kerry. Later in the campaign his followers heckled Kerry and disrupted his rallies.\n\nHe held a media conference in which he declared his support for John Kerry and pledged to mobilize his organization to help defeat George W. Bush in the November presidential election.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, LaRouchePAC advised readers to write in Lyndon LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton in the 2016 Presidential elections. In the article \"What We Need in 2016: — Alexander Hamilton's Principles, LaRouche's Four Laws\", the PAC wrote \"American citizens should write in LaRouche's name at the presidential ballot box to stand for the re-adoption of Alexander Hamilton's economic principles, as LaRouche has reclarified them. \"I'm writing in LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton, let's get the nation to elect the right principles\" will cut through the dread with which Americans are questioning each other about the approach of Election Day.\" \n\nThis exhortation was disseminated by PAC members through social media. No verifiable statistics have been assembled concerning vote totals.\n\nUnknown years\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the FEC dismissed a complaint filed by LaRouche associate Barbara M. Boyd against LaRouche Watch, an online forum, and Red Letter Press, a publishing house affiliated with the Freedom Socialist Party. The Commission found \"no reason to believe\" that the forum was a political action committee, or that it was subsidized by Red Letter Press, as alleged by Boyd.\n\n\n"}

It has been marketed since 1964 with no decline in sales. Bamba makes up 25% of the Israeli snack market. Similar products from other domestic manufacturers include \"Parpar\" (Telma, since 2000 a subsidiary of Unilever) and \"Shush\" (Strauss-Elite).\n\nBamba is made from peanut butter-flavored puffed maize. Bamba contains no preservatives or food coloring, is enriched with several vitamins, and contains high amounts of fat and salt. The energy content is 160 calories per 28 grams. Bamba is certified Kosher by \"Badatz\" Jerusalem. Some describe it as \"Cheez Doodles without the cheese.\"\n\nCorn grits are \"popped\" under high pressure, turning them into long lines of white, puffed, unflavored Bamba. The lines are cut into nuggets and then moved to a drying chamber where they are air-baked for 20 seconds, which gives them a crispy texture. The peanut butter, imported from Argentina, is added at the end. A worker stands on a step above the rotating drums and pours a pitcher of liquid peanut butter into each of the containers. As the drums turn, the nuggets are coated. The hot Bamba is then moved along a conveyor belt to cool before packaging.\n\nOsem also produces strawberry-flavored Bamba (officially called 'Sweet Bamba' , and unofficially 'Red Bamba' ) that is round in shape instead of oblong, and red instead of the usual color. It was originally colored with an artificial red dye, which has since been replaced with beetroot.\nIn 2008 Osem introduced a new Bamba flavor, nougat-filled, produced at the Osem plant in Sderot. It is considered by the Nestlé group, owner of the controlling interest in Osem, to be one of the great successes of Nestlé in Israel.\nOsem introduced a halva-filled and a chocolate-filled Bamba in 2010, and a \"Bamba-filled Bamba\" (a peanut-butter paste filled Bamba) in 2013. in 2014 Osem introduced a special edition of Bamba and Bissli mixed within the same package. In 2015, 60gr bags of Bamba bomba were introduced to the market, as well as Banana Punch flavoured Bamaba. Coin sized and shaped, \"round Bamba\" was introduced by the company In 2016, as well as a mini Bamba version of the snack called \"Bambini\". For Purim 2017, Osem introduced a Pretzel shaped Bamba, and towards the summer of that same year, a caramel biscuit flavoured cream filled Bamba. Ice-coffee filled Bamba was introduced in 2018, and in winter 2019 Osem introduced both Cappuccino cream filled Bamba, as well as Bamba with Chocolate. \n\nBack in 1963 the Bahlsen company launched a very similar product to the classic Bamba called 'Erdnussflips' (peanut flips) in Germany where it remains a staple snack.\n\nAs Bamba is made with peanuts, people allergic to peanuts may be severely affected by it. However early peanut consumption is associated with less prevalence of peanut allergy. In fact, a 2008 study concluded that, due to the extensive consumption of Bamba by infants in Israel, peanut allergy is rare. A control group of Jewish children in the UK had ten times higher rates of allergy; the difference is not accounted for by differences in atopy, social class, genetic background, or peanut allergenicity.\n\nSome health experts say that Bamba should not be promoted as a \"healthy\" children's snack. They say this claim is deceptive, and the added vitamins in Bamba could result in over-consumption of nutrients.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1027240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1027240", "title": "Biryani", "text": "Biryani\n\nBiryani (), also known as biriyani, biriani, birani or briyani, is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among the diaspora from the region. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan. It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken, goat, beef, prawn, or fish), vegetables or eggs.\n\n\"Biryani\" is a Hindustani word derived from the Persian language, which was used as an official language in different parts of medieval India by various Islamic dynasties. One theory states that it originated from \"birinj\", the Persian word for rice. Another theory states that it is derived from \"biryan\" or \"beriyan\", which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast.\"\n\nThe exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centers of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Telangana (specifically Hyderabad), Tamil Nadu (Ambur), Kerala (Malabar), and Karnataka, where Muslim communities were present. Andhra is the only region of South India that does not have many native varieties of biryani. During the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) in Persia, a dish called \"Berian Pilao\" (Nastaliq script: ) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight — with dahi, herbs, spices, dried fruits (e.g., raisins, prunes, or pomegranate seeds) — and later cooked in a tandoor oven. It was then served with steamed rice.\n\nAccording to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian \"pilaf\". Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals. Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur came to India. The 16th-century Mughal text \"Ain-i-Akbari\" makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India. A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.\n\nAccording to Pratibha Karan, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by the Arab traders. She speculates that the \"pulao\" was an army dish in medieval India. The armies, unable to cook elaborate meals, would prepare a one-pot dish where they cooked rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary. According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.\n\nPilaf or \"pulao\", as it is known in the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.\n\nAccording to Delhi-based historian Sohail Nakhvi, pulao tends to be comparatively plainer than the biryani and consists of meat (or vegetables) cooked with rice. Biryani, on the other hand, contains more gravy (due to the use of \"yakhni\" in it), and is often cooked for longer, leaving the meat or vegetables more tender. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings. Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (or vegetables) in the middle; whereas, the pulao is not layered.\n\nColleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:\n\nIngredients vary according to the region and the type of meat used. Meat (of either chicken, goat, beef, lamb, prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, some vegetables are also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, kismis and fruits, such as apples and pineapples.\n\nThe spices and condiments used in biryani may include ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. In all biryanis, the main ingredient that accompanies the spices is the chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.\n\nKacchi biryani\n\nTehari\n\nBeef biryani\n\nThere are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka, Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka, Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai. Biryanis are often specific to the respective Muslim communities where they originate, as they are usually the defining dishes of those communities. Cosmopolitanism has also led to the creation of these native versions to suit the tastes of others as well.\n\nDelhi biryani\n\nSindhi biryani\n\nHyderabadi biryani\n\nThalassery biryani\n\nKolkata biryani\n\nAmbur/Vaniyambadi biryani\n\nChettinad biryani\n\nBhatkali/Navayathi biryani\n\nMemoni/Kutchi biryani\n\nDindigul biryani\n\nBohri biryani\n\nKalyani biryani\n\nSri Lankan biryani\n\nRawther biryani\n\nIn Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as \"danpauk\" or \"danbauk\", from the Persian \"dum pukht\". Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf. In Burmese biryani, the chicken is cooked with the rice. Biryani is also eaten with a salad of sliced onions and cucumber.\n\nOne form of \"Arabic\" biryani is the Iraqi preparation (برياني: \"biryani\"), where the rice is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is most popular in Iraqi Kurdistan. Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds and raisins spread liberally over the rice. Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (\"maraq\").\n\nIn Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736), a dish called \"Berian\" (Nastaliq script: ) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight — with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds — and later cooked in a tannour oven. It was then served with steamed rice.\n\nA different dish called \"biryan\" is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (\"yakhni\") and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between the pulao and biryani. The Afghani biryani tends to use a lot of dry fruit and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.\n\nNasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee. Nasi kebuli is descended from Kabuli Palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\"Nasi Briyani\" dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian Indian cuisine, they are popularized through Mamak stalls, hawker centres, food courts as well as fine dining restaurants.\n\nBiryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius especially at Hindu and Muslim weddings. It is also widely available at street food places.\n\nKapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called \"Nasing Biringyi\" (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Philippino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing Biringyi is similar to the Nasi Briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste, but is also compared to a saffron-cooked version of Spanish Paella.\n\nIn the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually goat meat or chicken). The dish may be seasoned with garam masala or a curry spice mix (though this is not authentic to the local style) and coloured, sometimes heavily, with turmeric.\n\nBiryani in Thailand is commonly known as \"khao mhok\" (). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and often served with a green sour sauce.\n\n\n"}

Endodontics has evolved tremendously in the past decade and its applications have immensely improved the quality of dental treatment.\n\nIn clinical terms, endodontics involves either preserving part, or all of the dental pulp in health, or removing all of the pulp in irreversible disease. This includes teeth with irreversibly inflamed and infected pulpal tissue. Not only does endodontics involve treatment when a dental pulp is present, but also includes preserving teeth which have failed to respond to non-surgical endodontic treatment, or for teeth that have developed new lesions, e.g., when root canal re-treatment is required, or periradicular surgery.\n\nThe main purpose of endodontic treatment (root canal therapy) is to remove the diseased pulp, clean and shape the root canal system, disinfect the contaminated root canals, and then obturate (fill) the root canal system to prevent re-infection and promote periradicular healing. The aim is to have radiographic evidence of healing, with no postoperative lesions present, and restored periradicular health if preoperative lesions were present. The main reason for dental pulpal problems has been related to bacterial contamination of the root canals. Therefore, significantly reducing the bacterial load within the root canal system, and then filling the canals with an inert obturating material aid in preventing bacterial re-infection (see Gutta-percha#Dentistry).\n\nEndodontic therapy is not only performed when pain relief from an infected or inflamed pulp is required. It is also done to prevent adverse signs and symptoms from the surrounding sequelae and promote the healing and repair of the surrounding periradicular tissues. An example of which is if there is trauma to a front tooth which has caused it to be avulsed from the bony socket; endodontic treatment is required following re-implantation to preserve the aesthetics and function of the tooth, even though there may be no adverse symptoms of the dental pulp, or pain present at the time.\n\nEndodontists are specialist dentists with additional training, experience and formal qualifications in endodontic treatment, apicectomies, microsurgery, and dental emergency and trauma management. The use of magnification devices such as microscopes, and dental loupes have been widely accepted among endodontists and practitioners; its use is believed to increase accuracy and visualization in the operating field, however, a Cochrane review in 2015 found no evidence to determine whether there's a difference in the outcome of a procedure done by magnification devices or a conventional procedure done with no magnification. Endodontic treatment is one of the most common procedures. If the dental pulp (containing nerves, arterioles, venules, lymphatic tissue, and fibrous tissue) becomes diseased or injured, endodontic treatment is required to save the tooth. Endodontics is recognized as a specialty by many national dental organizations including the Dental Board of Australia, British General Dental Council, American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, Indian Dental Association, and Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons.\n\nIn Australia, endodontics is recognized as one of the thirteen registered dental specialties. In addition to a dental degree, Endodontists have an additional three years of postgraduate University training in the area of Endodontics to be recognized and registered by the Dental Board of Australia. A general dentist is permitted by law to perform endodontic treatment, but must be competent in the skills required for the endodontic treatment, and refer complex cases for specialist management.\nIn the United States after finishing a dental degree, a dentist must undergo 2–3 additional years of postgraduate training to become an Endodontist. American Dental Association (CODA) accredited programs are a minimum of two years in length. Following successful completion of this training, the dentist becomes Board eligible to sit for the American Board of Endodontics examination. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomate status in the American Board of Endodontics.\n\nAlthough general dentists can perform endodontic treatment, there are several things which set endodontists apart. Endodontists use microscopes during treatment to better treat the small internal anatomy of teeth without taking away too much tooth structure, or causing iatrogenic damage. Also, endodontists use CBCT (3D imaging) to assess case difficulty and for diagnosis and treatment planning of endodontic cases.\n\n\n\n"}

In Denmark, it is known as \"Kanelsnegl\"; 'cinnamon snail' and is a form of wienerbrød ('Vienna Bread'). Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor. \n\nA cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of yeast-leavened dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (and raisins or other ingredients in some cases) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions, and baked or deep fried. \n\nIn Sweden, the country of its presumed origin, the cinnamon roll takes the name of \"kanelbulle\" (literally 'cinnamon bun'). Since 1999, October 4 has been promoted as 'kanelbullens dag' (Cinnamon Roll Day). Swedish kanelbulle dough typically also contains cardamom (powder or buds), giving it a distinctive flavour.\n\nThe size of a cinnamon roll varies from place to place, but many vendors supply a smaller size about in diameter and a larger size about to a side. The larger variety can be found in Finland, called \"korvapuusti\" (literally: a 'slap on the ear'), where it can be up to in diameter and weigh up to .

These cinnamon rolls are called \"hagabullar\" or 'Queen of the kitchen'. \"Hagabullar\" are usually 12 inches or more in diameter and are, despite their size, not considered a communal roll. Each person usually orders one each.\n\nIn Northern Europe, nib sugar is usually used with a glaze instead of icing. The Finnish \"bostonkakku\" ('Boston cake') is a cake made by baking cinnamon rolls in a round cake pan instead of baking them separately, so that they stick together to form a large, round cake.\n\nA German variety, which closely follows the form of the Scandinavian pastry, originating in Hamburg and its surroundings is the \"Franzbrötchen\", a cinnamon pastry inspired by the non-cinnamon French croissant.\n\nThe British version is an approximation of the Danish butter type and is readily available in cafes, supermarkets, and bakeries across the UK.\n\nAmerican cinnamon rolls are frequently topped with icing (usually confectioners' sugar-based) and are sometimes fried, finished with glaze, and served as a variation of a raised donut. There are also regional variations: in the American Midwest, especially Kansas, cinnamon rolls may be dipped or smothered in chili.\n\nIn Canada, they are known as cinnamon buns. They are usually self-glazed and not iced, nor do they usually have raisins. They can have so much cinnamon that they are spicy and hot to the taste.\n\nIn Sweden, cinnamon rolls are traditionally enjoyed during a coffee break, or Fika which is a get together with friends. In North America, it is commonly eaten for breakfast or dessert. When eaten for a breakfast in the U.S., it may be served with cream cheese.\n"}

Common additions include green bell pepper slices or caper berries (especially in the Dodecanese islands). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer's breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.\n\nOutside Greece, \"Greek salad\" may be a lettuce salad with Greek-inspired ingredients, even though the original dish is distinguished by the absence of lettuce. Meanwhile, the variant without lettuce may be called \"horiatiki\", \"country salad\", \"peasant salad\", or \"village salad\". Lettuce, tomatoes, feta (often served in multiple cube-shaped cuttings mixed with the vegetables), and olives are the most standard elements in an American-style Greek salad, but cucumbers, peperoncini (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, radishes, \"dolmades\", and anchovies/sardines are common. In Detroit, for example, Greek salad includes beets, and in the Tampa Bay Area, it often includes potato salad. Dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used in the U.S. This style of Greek salad is rarely encountered in Greece.\n\nVarious other salads have also been called \"Greek\" in the English language in the last century, including some with no apparent connection to Greek cuisine.

It can dramatically increase cache performance, while decreasing the memory overhead associated with storing list metadata such as references. It is related to the B-tree.\n\nA typical unrolled linked list node looks like this:\n\nEach node holds up to a certain maximum number of elements, typically just large enough so that the node fills a single cache line or a small multiple thereof. A position in the list is indicated by both a reference to the node and a position in the elements array. It is also possible to include a \"previous\" pointer for an unrolled doubly linked list.\n\nTo insert a new element, we simply find the node the element should be in and insert the element into the codice_1 array, incrementing codice_2. If the array is already full, we first insert a new node either preceding or following the current one and move half of the elements in the current node into it.\n\nTo remove an element, we simply find the node it is in and delete it from the codice_1 array, decrementing codice_2. If this reduces the node to less than half-full, then we move elements from the next node to fill it back up above half. If this leaves the next node less than half full, then we move all its remaining elements into the current node, then bypass and delete it.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of unrolled linked lists is decreased storage requirements. All nodes (except at most one) are at least half-full. If many random inserts and deletes are done, the average node will be about three-quarters full, and if inserts and deletes are only done at the beginning and end, almost all nodes will be full. Assume that:\nThen, the space used for \"n\" elements varies between formula_1 and formula_2. For comparison, ordinary linked lists require formula_3 space, although \"v\" may be smaller, and arrays, one of the most compact data structures, require formula_4 space. Unrolled linked lists effectively spread the overhead \"v\" over a number of elements of the list. Thus, we see the most significant space gain when overhead is large, codice_5 is large, or elements are small.\n\nIf the elements are particularly small, such as bits, the overhead can be as much as 64 times larger than the data on many machines. Moreover, many popular memory allocators will keep a small amount of metadata for each node allocated, increasing the effective overhead \"v\". Both of these make unrolled linked lists more attractive.\n\nBecause unrolled linked list nodes each store a count next to the \"next\" field, retrieving the \"k\"th element of an unrolled linked list (indexing) can be done in \"n\"/\"m\" + 1 cache misses, up to a factor of \"m\" better than ordinary linked lists. Additionally, if the size of each element is small compared to the cache line size, the list can be traversed in order with fewer cache misses than ordinary linked lists. In either case, operation time still increases linearly with the size of the list.\n\n\n\n"}

This assumption is supported by the fact that the restaurant was in the former residence of Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was from Béarn, a former province now in the department of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in southwestern France.\n\nLike Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of Béarnaise sauce. The most common preparation is a \"bain-marie\" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidulate the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (\"sans\" lemon juice). \"Joy of Cooking\" describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients. A \"faux\" Béarnaise can be produced by adding capers and tarragon to a Hollandaise.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1036945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1036945", "title": "Vergangenheitsbewältigung", "text": "Vergangenheitsbewältigung\n\nVergangenheitsbewältigung (, \"struggle to overcome the [negatives of the] past\" or “working through the past”) is a German term describing processes that since the later 20th century have become key in the study of post-1945 German literature, society, and culture.\n\nThe German Duden lexicon defines \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" as \"public debate within a country on a problematic period of its recent history—in Germany on National Socialism, in particular\"—where \"problematic\" refers to traumatic events that raise sensitive questions of collective culpability. In Germany, and originally, the term refers to embarrassment about and often remorse for Germans' complicity in the war crimes of the Wehrmacht, Holocaust, and related events of the early and mid-20th century, including World War II. In this sense, the word can refer to the psychic process of denazification. With the absorption into the current Federal Republic of Germany of East Germany since 1990 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" can also refer to coming to terms with the excesses and human rights abuses associated with that former Communist state.\n\n\"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" describes the attempt to analyze, digest and learn to live with the past, in particular the Holocaust. The focus on learning is much in the spirit of philosopher George Santayana's oft-quoted observation that \"those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it\". It is a technical term also used in English that was coined after 1945 in West Germany, relating specifically to the atrocities committed during the Third Reich, when Adolf Hitler was in power in Germany, and to both historical and contemporary concerns about the extensive compromise and co-optation of many German cultural, religious, and political institutions by Nazism. The term therefore deals at once with the concrete responsibility of the German state (West Germany assumed the legal obligations of the Reich) and of individual Germans for what took place \"under Hitler\", and with questions about the roots of legitimacy in a society whose development of the Enlightenment collapsed in the face of Nazi ideology.\n\nMore recently, the term \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" has also been used in the former East Germany to refer to the process of working through the brutalities of Communist institutions.\n\nHistorically, \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" often is seen as the logical \"next step\" after a denazification driven at first under Allied Occupation and then by the Christian Democratic Union government of Konrad Adenauer. It dates from the late 1950s and early 1960s, roughly the period in which the work of the \"Wiederaufbau\" (reconstruction) became less absorbing and urgent. Having replaced the institutions and power structures of Nazism, the aim of liberal Germans was to deal with the guilt of recent history. \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" is characterised in part by learning from the past. This includes honestly admitting that such a past did indeed exist, attempting to remedy as far as possible the wrongs committed, and attempting to move on from that past.\n\nThe German churches, of which only a minority played a significant role in the resistance to Nazism, have led the way in this process. They have developed a specifically German post-war theology of repentance. At the regular mass church rallies, the Lutheran Kirchentag and the Catholic \"Katholikentag\", for example, have developed this theme as a leitmotiv of Christian youth.\n\n\"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" has been expressed by the society through its schools, where in most German states the centrally-written curriculum provides each child with repeated lessons on different aspects of Nazism in German history, politics and religion classes from the fifth grade onwards, and related to their maturity. Associated school trips may have destinations of concentration camps. Jewish Holocaust survivors are often invited to schools as guest speakers, though the passage of time limits these opportunities as their generation has aged.\n\nIn philosophy, Theodor Adorno's writings include the lecture \"Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit?\" (\"What is meant by 'working through the past'?\"), a subject related to his thinking of \"after Auschwitz\" in his later work. He delivered the lecture on November 9, 1959, at a conference on education held in Wiesbaden. Writing in the context of a new wave of anti-Semitic attacks against synagogues and Jewish community institutions occurring in West Germany at that time, Adorno rejected the contemporary catch phrase \"working through the past\" as misleading. He argued that it masked a denial, rather than signifying the kind of critical self-reflection that Freudian theory called for in order to \"come to terms\" with the past.\n\nAdorno's lecture is often seen as consisting in part of a variably implicit and explicit critique of the work of Martin Heidegger, whose formal ties to the Nazi Party are well known. Heidegger, distinct from his role in the Party during the Third Reich, attempted to provide a historical conception of Germania as a philosophical notion of German origin and destiny (later he would speak of \"the West\"). Alexander Garcia Düttman's \"Das Gedächtnis des Denkens. Versuch über Heidegger und Adorno\" (\"The Memory of Thought: An Essay on Heidegger and Adorno\", translated by Nicholas Walker) attempts to treat the philosophical value of these seemingly opposed and certainly incompatible terms \"Auschwitz\" and \"Germania\" in the philosophy of both men.\n\nIn the cultural sphere, the term \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" is associated with a movement in German literature, characterised by such authors as Günter Grass and Siegfried Lenz. Lenz's novel \"Deutschstunde\" and Grass's \"Danziger Trilogie\" both deal with childhoods under Nazism.\n\nThe erection of public monuments to Holocaust victims has been a tangible commemoration of Germany's \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\". Concentration camps, such as Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen and Flossenbürg, are open to visitors as memorials and museums. Most towns have plaques on walls marking the spots where particular atrocities took place.\n\nWhen the seat of government was moved from Bonn to Berlin in 1999, an extensive \"Holocaust memorial\", designed by architect Peter Eisenman, was planned as part of the extensive development of new official buildings in the district of Berlin-Mitte; it was opened on 10 May 2005. The informal name of this memorial, the \"Holocaust-Mahnmal,\" is significant. It does not translate easily: \"Holocaust Cenotaph\" would be one sense, but the noun \"Mahnmal,\" which is distinct from the term \"Denkmal\" (typically used to translate \"memorial\") carries the sense of \"admonition\", \"urging\", \"appeal\", or \"warning\", rather than \"remembrance\" as such. The work is formally known as \"Das Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas\" (English translation, \"The Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe\"). Some controversy attaches to it precisely because of this formal name and its exclusive emphasis on Jewish victims. As Eisenman acknowledged at the opening ceremony, \"It is clear that we won't have solved all the problems — architecture is not a panacea for evil — nor will we have satisfied all those present today, but this cannot have been our intention.\"\n\nIn Austria, ongoing arguments about the nature and significance of the Anschluss, and unresolved disputes about legal expressions of obligation and liability, have led to very different concerns, and to a far less institutionalized response by the government. Since the late 20th century, observers and analysts have expressed concerns about the ascent of \"Haiderism\".\n\nPoland has maintained a museum, archive, and research centre at Oświęcim, better known by its German name of Auschwitz, since a July 2, 1947 act of the Polish Parliament. In the same year, Czechoslovakia established what was known as the \"National Suffering Memorial\" and later as the Terezín memorial in Terezín, Czech Republic. This site during the Holocaust was known as the concentration camp of Theresienstadt. In the context of varying degrees of Communist orthodoxy in both countries during the period of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe through much of the late 20th century, historical research into the Holocaust was politicised to varying degrees. Marxist doctrines of class struggle were often overlaid onto generally received histories, which tended to exclude both acts of collaboration and indications of abiding antisemitism in these nations.\n\nThe advance of the \"Einsatzgruppen\", \"Aktion Reinhardt\", and other significant events in the Holocaust did not happen in the Third Reich proper (or what is now the territory of the Federal Republic). The history of the memorials and archives which have been erected at these sites in eastern Europe is associated with the Communist regimes that ruled these areas for more than four decades after World War II. The Nazis promoted an idea of an expansive German nation extending into territories where ethnic Germans had previously settled. They invaded and controlled much of Central and Eastern Europe, unleashing violence against various Slavic groups, as well as Jews, Communists, homosexuals, gypsies, prisoners of war, and so-called partisans. There were millions of victims in addition to Jews. After the war, the eastern European nations expelled German settlers as well as long settled ethnic Germans (the \"Volksdeutsche\") as a reaction to the Reich's attempt to claim the eastern lands on behalf of ethnic Germans.\n\nCzechoslovakia and Poland described their process as \"lustration\".\n\nIn some of its aspects, \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung\" can be compared to the attempts of other democratic countries to raise consciousness and come to terms with earlier periods of governmental and social abuses, such as the South African process of \"truth and reconciliation\" following the period of apartheid and suppression of African groups seeking political participation and freedom from white oppression.\n\nSome comparisons have been made with the Soviet process of \"glasnost,\" though this was less focused on the past than achieving a level of open criticism necessary for progressive reform to take place. (It generally assumed that the Communist Party monopoly on power would be maintained.) Since the late 20th century and the fall of the Soviet Union, the continuing efforts in nations of eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union to reinterpret the communist past and its abuses is sometimes referred to as a post-socialist \"Vergangenheitsbewältigung.\"\n\nThe World War II history of Japan's involvement in Japanese war crimes is something the future Emperor, Crown Prince Naruhito, has had his own concerns about with how accurately such events are remembered in the 21st century, on the occasion of his own 55th birthday, and not known to be related to the more recently-revealed future event of his expected ascendancy to the Chrysanthemum Throne, itself likely to occur on April 30, 2019.\n\nPolitical satirist Roy Zimmerman has a song called \"Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung\" on his album \"Security\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1038519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1038519", "title": "Barbette", "text": "Barbette\n\nBarbettes are several types of gun emplacement in terrestrial fortifications or on naval ships.\n\nIn recent naval usage, a 'barbette' is a protective circular armour support for a heavy gun turret. This evolved from earlier forms of gun protection that eventually led to the pre-dreadnought. The name ultimately comes from fortification, originally meaning a raised platform or mound, seen in the French phrase \"en barbette\", which refers to the practice of firing a cannon over a parapet rather than through an embrasure in a fortification's casemate. The former gives better angles of fire but less protection than the latter. The disappearing gun was a variation on the barbette gun; it consisted of a heavy gun on a carriage that would retract behind a parapet or into a gunpit for reloading. They were primarily used in coastal defences, but saw some use in a handful of warships, and some inland fortifications. The term is also used for certain aircraft gun mounts.\n\nShipboard barbettes were primarily used in armoured warships starting in the 1860s during a period of intense experimentation with other mounting systems for heavy guns at sea. In these, gun barrels usually protruded over the barbette edge, so these provided only partial protection, mainly for the ammunition supply. Alternatives included the heavily armored gun turret and an armored, fixed central gun battery. By the late 1880s, all three systems were replaced with a hybrid barbette-turret system that combined the benefits of both types. The heavily armored vertical tube that supported the new gun mount was referred to as a barbette.\n\nGuns with restricted arcs of fire mounted in heavy bombers during World War II—such those in the tail of the aircraft, as opposed to fully revolving turrets—were also sometimes referred to as having barbette mounts, though usage of the term is primarily restricted to British publications. American authors generally refer to such mounts simply as tail guns or tail gun turrets.\n\nThe use of barbette mountings originated in ground fortifications. The term originally referred to a raised platform on a rampart for one or more guns, enabling them to be fired over a parapet. This gave rise to the phrase \"en barbette\", which referred to a gun placed to fire over a parapet, rather than through an embrasure, an opening in a fortification wall. While an \"en barbette\" emplacement offered wider arcs of fire, it also exposed the gun's crew to greater danger from hostile fire. In addition, since the barbette position would be higher than a casemate position—that is, a gun firing through an embrasure—it would generally have a greater field of fire. The American military theorist Dennis Hart Mahan suggested that light guns, particularly howitzers, were best suited for barbette emplacements since they could fire explosive shells and could be easily withdrawn when they came under enemy fire. Fortifications in the 19th century typically employed both casemate and barbette emplacements. For example, the Russian Fort Constantine outside Sevastopol was equipped with 43 heavy guns in its seaward side during the Crimean War in the mid-1850s; of these, 27 were in barbettes, with the rest in casemates.\n\nA modified version of the barbette type was the disappearing gun, which placed a heavy gun on a carriage that retracted behind a parapet for reloading; this better protected the crew, and made the gun harder to target, since it was only visible while it was firing. The type was usually used for coastal defence guns. As naval gun turrets improved to allow greater elevation and range, many disappearing guns, most of which were limited in elevation, were seen as obsolescent; with aircraft becoming prominent in the First World War, they were largely seen as obsolete. However, they remained in use through the early Second World War, at least by the United States, due to limited funding for replacement weapons between the wars.\nLater heavy coastal guns were often protected in hybrid installations, in wide casemates with cantilevered overhead cover partially covering a barbette or gunhouse mount.\n\nFollowing the introduction of ironclad warships in the early 1860s, naval designers grappled with the problem of mounting heavy guns in the most efficient way possible. The first generation of ironclads employed the same broadside arrangement as the old ship of the line, but it was not particularly effective for ahead or stern fire. This was particularly important to designers, since the tactic of ramming was revived following its successful employment at the decisive Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Ramming required a ship to steam directly at its opponent, which greatly increased the importance of end-on fire. Designers such as Cowper Phipps Coles and John Ericsson designed the first gun turrets in the 1860s, which gave the guns a wide field of fire. These turrets were exceedingly heavy, which required them to be placed low in the ship to reduce top-weight—and produced a dangerous tendency to capsize in heavy seas, amply demonstrated by the loss of and Coles himself with the ship in a gale in 1870.\n\nIn the 1870s, designers began to experiment with an en barbette type of mounting. The barbette was a fixed armoured enclosure protecting the gun. The barbette could take the form of a circular or elongated ring of armour around the rotating gun mount over which the guns (possibly fitted with a gun shield) fired. The barbette system reduced weight considerably, since the machinery for the rotating gun mount, along with the mount itself, was much lighter than that required for the gun house of a turret. The savings in weight could then be passed on to increase armour protection for the hull, improve coal storage capacity, or to install larger, more powerful engines. In addition, because barbettes were lighter, they could be placed higher in the ship without jeopardizing stability, which improved their ability to be worked in heavy seas that would have otherwise rendered turrets unusable. This also permitted a higher freeboard, which also improved seakeeping.\n\nIronclads equipped with barbettes were referred to as \"barbette ships\" much like their contemporaries, turret ships and central battery ships, which mounted their heavy guns in turrets or in a central armored battery. Many navies experimented with all three types in the 1870s and 1880s, including the British Admiral-class battleships, the French s, the Italian s, and the German s, all of which employed barbettes to mount their heavy guns. All of these navies also built turret and or central battery ships during the same period, though none had a decisive advantage over the other. The British and the Russian navies experimented with using disappearing guns afloat, including on the British , the Russian monitor \"Vitse-admiral Popov\", and some of the s. They were not deemed particularly successful and were not repeated.\n\nIn the late 1880s, the debate between barbette or turret mounts was finally settled. The , mounted their guns in barbettes, but the follow-on design, the , adopted a new mounting that combined the benefits of both kinds of mounts. A heavily armoured, rotating gun house was added to the revolving platform, which kept the guns and their crews protected. The gun house was smaller and lighter than the old-style turrets, which still permitted placement higher in the ship and the corresponding benefits to stability and seakeeping. This innovation gradually became known simply as a turret, though the armored tube that held the turret substructure, which included the shell and propellant handling rooms and the ammunition hoists, was still referred to as a barbette. These ships were the prototype of the so-called pre-dreadnought battleships, which proved to be broadly influential in all major navies over the next fifteen years.\n\nShips equipped with barbette mountings did not see a great deal of combat, owing to the long period of relative peace between their appearance in the 1870s and their obsolescence in the 1890s. Some barbette ships saw action during the British Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, and the participated in the Battle of Fuzhou during the Sino-French War in 1884. The two Chinese ironclads, and , that took part in the Battle of the Yalu River during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, carried their main battery in barbettes, though they were equipped with extensive gun shields that resembled turrets. The shields were nevertheless only proof against small-arms fire. Three of their opponents at the Yalu River, the Japanese s, also mounted their guns in open barbettes. Those barbette ships that survived into World War I were typically used only for secondary purposes. For example, the French was used as a repair ship for submarines and torpedo boats, while the German was employed as a torpedo training ship. A handful of barbette ships did see action during the war, including the British , which bombarded German positions in Flanders in 1914 and 1915.\n\nWhen applied to military aircraft, largely in aviation history books written by British historians, a barbette is a position on an aircraft where a gun is in a mounting which has a restricted arc of fire when compared to a turret, or which is remotely mounted away from the gunner. As such it is frequently used to describe the tail gunner position on bombers such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, with American aviation books frequently describing the position as a tail gun turret, or simply as a tail gun.\n\nThe term \"barbette\" is also used by some, again primarily British historians, to describe a remotely aimed and operated gun turret emplacement on almost any non-American military aircraft of World War II, but it is \"not\" usable in a direct translation for the varying German language terms used on \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft of that era for such emplacements. As just one example, the German Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber had such a remotely operated twin-MG 131 machine gun \"Fernbedienbare Drehlafette\" FDL 131Z \"(Z - \"zwilling\"\"/twin) powered forward dorsal gun turret, with the full translation of the German term comprising the prefix as \"Remotely controlled rotating gun mount\".\n\n\n"}

Some variations add garlic or lettuce, or use couscous instead of bulgur.\n\nTabbouleh is traditionally served as part of a mezze in the Arab world. Its popularity has grown in Western cultures.\n\nThe Levantine Arabic \"tabbūle\" is derived from the Arabic word \"tābil\", meaning \"seasoning\" or more literally \"dip\". Use of the word in English first appeared in the 1950s.\n\nEdible herbs known as \"qaḍb\" formed an essential part of the Arab diet in the Middle Ages. Dishes like tabbouleh attest to their continued popularity in Middle Eastern cuisine today. Originally from the mountains between Syria and Lebanon, tabbouleh has become one of the most popular salads in the Middle East. The wheat variety \"salamouni\" cultivated in Syria, Beqaa Valley and Baalbek was considered (in the mid-19th century) as particularly well-suited for making bulgur, a basic ingredient of tabbouleh.\n\nIn the Middle East, particularly Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq, it is usually served as part of a meze. The Syrian and the Lebanese use more parsley than bulgur wheat in their dish. A Turkish variation of the dish known as \"kısır\", and a similar Armenian dish known as \"eetch\" use far more bulgur than parsley. Another ancient variant is called terchots. In Cyprus, where the dish was introduced by the Syrians, it is known as \"tambouli\". In the Dominican Republic, a local version introduced by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants is called \"Tipile\". In Iran and South Asia it is usually eaten with rice, bread and kebabs.\n\nLike Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Pita bread, and other elements of Arab cuisine, tabbouleh has become a popular food in America.\n\n\n"}

Wild game is often added to enhance the taste of the pie. A traditional part of the Christmas \"réveillon\" and New Year's Eve meal in Quebec, it is also popular in New Brunswick, and is sold in grocery stores across the rest of Canada, all year long.\n\nTourtière is not exclusive to Quebec. It is a traditional French-Canadian dish served by generations of French-Canadian families throughout Canada and the bordering areas of the United States. In the New England region of the U.S., especially in Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts (e.g., Chicopee and Attleboro), late 19th and early 20th century immigrants from Quebec introduced the dish.\n\nThere is no one correct filling; the meat depends on what is regionally available. In coastal areas, fish such as salmon is commonly used, whereas pork, beef, rabbit and game are often included inland. The name derives from the vessel in which it was originally cooked, a tourtière.\n\nTourtière has become the traditional and iconic dish of the region of Saguenay, Quebec since the Second World War, and it has undergone several metamorphoses according to the culinary history. The first recipe for what we consider today as pies was documented back to 1600 BCE. After that around 400 CE, some evidence proved the existence of patina (the prototype of tourtière), which was slightly different from the pie we have today in terms of the pie crust and composition. In the Middle Ages, patina and artocreas reappeared in some European countries. In Italy, the pie was named as \"pasticcio\", \"timballo\" or \"timpano de macaroni\". Something similar also occurred in England which was named \"battle pies\" and also the \"tourte parmenienne\" in France. During the 18th Century, a dish named \"sea pie\" became popular among French and British colonists. Jean-Pierre Lemasson (2009) described sea pie as \"the direct forerunner of the tourtière of Lac-Saint-Jean\"(p. 109)\n\nThe tourtières of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area and Eastern Quebec are slow-cooked deep-dish meat pies made with potatoes and various meats (often including wild game) cut into small cubes.\n\nElsewhere in Quebec and the rest of Canada, this variety of tourtière is sometimes referred to, in French and in English, as \"tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean\" or \"tourtière saguenéenne\" to distinguish it from the varieties of tourtière with ground meat.\n\nTourtière in Montreal is made with finely ground pork only (which can be hard to find as the meat is often ground too coarsely elsewhere). Water is added to the meat after browning, and cinnamon and cloves give it a distinctive flavour. Many people use ketchup as a condiment, though the tourtière is also often eaten with maple syrup or molasses, mango chutney, or cranberry preserves.\n\nAlthough it is less popular than the original tourtière and the tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean, this version can also be commonly found throughout Canada and its surrounding areas.\n\nTourtière is an integral part of holiday-time meals for French Canadians in St. Boniface, as well as in Manitoba's rural Francophone areas. Browned meat is seasoned with varying combinations of savory, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, celery salt, dry mustard, salt and pepper.\n\nAcadian tourtière, or pâté à la viande (pâté is casserole or pie), is a pork pie that may also contain chicken, hare and beef. Pâté à la viande varies from region to region in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In Petit-Rocher and Campbellton the dish is prepared in small pie plates and known as \"petits cochons\" (little pigs).\n\n\n"}

It has the dual purpose of masking the join between helm and crest, and holding the mantling in place.\n\nThe torse is sometimes mistakenly said to be the token, such as a handkerchief or sleeve, which the knight's lady-love gave him to wear when he left for the wars or participated in tournaments. This is due greatly to its original use being lost to history as the heraldic crest became more and more stylized and less representative of actual use.\n\nThe torse is blazoned as part of the crest. For example, the crest of Canada is blazoned \"On a wreath of the colours Argent and Gules, a lion passant guardant Or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf Gules.\" The tinctures of the torse are generally not mentioned in the blazon, as they are assumed to be of the principal metal and colour in the shield. Like the mantling, it must always be of a metal and a colour; usually the torse and the mantling are the same tinctures. In British heraldry, the torse is generally shown with six twists of material, alternately metal and colour.\n\nOccasionally the torse is replaced by a crown or coronet, which is then termed a \"crest-coronet\". In the past this practice was widespread amongst all ranks, but is nowadays usually denied to those outside the royalty and peerage, except in special circumstances. Some commoners have bypassed this rule by placing a coronet \"on top of\" a torse, rather than in place of it.\n\nThe torse is also often used as a decoration on a heraldic animal, either across the brow (as a form of circlet) or around the neck. Moors and Saracens are also traditionally depicted in heraldry with a torse across their brow.\n\nAgal\n"}

The result used less fruit juice and less sugar than some other drinks, and Bishop claimed it had the \"freshest, most exciting taste in the marketplace\".\n\nIn 1941, a mascot named \"Lil' Squirt\" was created for marketing the product. Squirt became a popular soft drink in many parts of the country, especially the West and Southwest. In the 1950s, it became commonly used as a mixer used in cocktails.\n\nThe Squirt brand has changed ownership several times, and is currently the property of Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nSquirt is naturally flavored but contains less than 1% grapefruit juice. Like many other soft drinks, the packaging of Squirt has varied over the years.\n\nIn 1983, Diet Squirt, the first soft drink in the United States to be sweetened with aspartame, was introduced.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, a vitamin-C-enriched Diet Squirt Plus was briefly marketed.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Squirt Sorbet, a frozen treat, was offered in Detroit area supermarkets.\n\nRuby Red Squirt and Diet Ruby Red Squirt, berry flavored variations of the beverage, have also been introduced. Unlike normal Squirt, Ruby Red Squirt contains caffeine.\n\nIn 2008, Squirt Citrus Power was introduced. Unlike regular Squirt, Squirt Citrus Power is caffeinated, lacks concentrated grapefruit juice, and contains taurine and other ingredients similar to an energy drink.\n\nCarbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup, natural flavors, concentrated grapefruit juice, citric acid, modified food starch, sodium benzoate, ester gum, brominated vegetable oil, calcium disodium EDTA.\n"}

It was brought into service in 1995. During initial combat exercises, several flaws were identified. In particular, the vehicle lacked defensive capabilities. As such, modifications were made to the turret of the Sabre to include redesigned smoke grenade launchers and the L94A1 7.62 mm chain gun replacing the standard 7.62 mm general-purpose machine gun, for anti-personnel use. An ammunition hopper sits on the side of the machine gun allowing the weapon to be more quickly reloaded than a belt-fed machine gun.\n\nThe marriage of the Fox turret and Scorpion chassis was not successful and Sabre was withdrawn from British Army service in 2004.\n\n"}

Red pudding is associated with the east of Scotland in general and particularly with Fife, though even in this area it has become less common in recent years. Broadly similar to the English saveloy, its main ingredients are beef, pork, pork rind or bacon, suet, rusk, wheat flour, spices, salt, beef fat and colouring.\n\nThe mixture is formed into a sausage shape of roughly eight inches in length, no different from black and white pudding and the chip shop variant of haggis. The pudding is usually cooked by being coated in a batter, deep fried, and served hot. Bought on its own it is known as a \"single red\", or when accompanied by chips it is known as a \"red pudding supper\".\n\nIn Scotland some butchers sell a different form of red pudding, made entirely of finely minced pork and formed into a ring similar to black pudding. These red puddings follow a quite different recipe to the chip shop red pudding, are flavoured with spices such as cumin, and are identified by a red casing. They were traditionally made by \"German\" pork butchers in parts of Scotland, mostly on the east coast, and are usually cooked for breakfast. Another form of red pudding is a speciality of Dundalk on the east coast of Ireland; this is an oatmeal-based pudding similar to white pudding.\n\n"}

A close relative of the croquet played in most backyards and gardens, but expanded by more adventurous enthusiasts and played throughout the world in conditions unfamiliar to official tournament players.\n\nThe main organisation in terms of officialdom is IFEC (International Federation of Extreme Croquet) founded in 1897 by Lord Barney and Colonel Tex from Team GB. The current president is Stanislav Zeljezenicar from Bosnia & Herzegovina, he was elected at the 44th croqlave to be held on the cliffs of Yarmouth (in memoriam).\n\nA typical extreme croquet game starts with location scouting, searching for terrain that might present interesting and novel challenges such as trees, roots, hills, sand, mud, or moving or still water. Play proceeds following the usual croquet rules, with alterations generally designed to handle circumstances not found in the garden game.\n\nTraditional backyard croquet equipment can be used but is prone to damage. Mallets, made specifically for extreme croquet, are made from high-density polyethylene, aluminum, polycarbonate and other durable materials.\n\nDifferent organizations use different sets of rules for extreme croquet. Variations include the following:\nThe Richmond Extreme Croquet Group has these rules:\n\nExtreme croquet dates back to the 1920s, when fashionable people built courses with sand traps and other hazards in California and on Long Island. The world's oldest extreme croquet club was founded 1975 in Sweden. The first documented extreme croquet matches in the United States took place in Friendswood, Texas, around 1995. A group of college kids looking for a bit more excitement than the traditional game could offer began to test the boundaries of the sport.\n\nBoston University is the home of BU International Extreme Croquet Society. The organization was founded in 2008. On April 5, 2010 BU Today featured a film on the club.\n\nThe Northwest Arkansas Nonprofessional-professional Extreme Croquet Association, or NANECA utilizes both urban and natural settings for its free flowing extreme croquet.\n\nDubuque, Iowa is well accepted as the national epicenter of extreme croquet. The iconic midwest town boasts two competitive extreme croquet leagues. ADCA (All Dubuque Croquet Association) was founded by Norman Charles Freund in 1982 and DCA (Dubuque Croquet Association) was founded by Norman's youngest heir, Gabriel Martin Freund in 2003. Both leagues have been featured in national publications.\n<ref><ref>\n\n"}
