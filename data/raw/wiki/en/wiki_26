Snow skin mooncakes are a non-baked mooncake originating from Hong Kong.\n\nThe snow skin mooncake is similar to mochi ice cream or yukimi daifuku, as both have glutinous rice crusts and have to be kept frozen. The requirements of production, storage and transportation for snow skin mooncakes are more stringent than for baked mooncakes. Because snow skin mooncakes are not baked in an oven, high temperatures cannot be used to kill bacteria. Factories have to keep sterile conditions, and many manufacturers are requested to follow HACCP systematic for food safety. The mooncakes are also kept at a low temperature while in storage, shipping and at the retailer to prevent bacteria growing. Snow skin mooncakes were difficult to find in Mainland China before the 2000s, because of the need to keep them refrigerated while in transit from the producer to the consumer. Today, the snow skin mooncake is also found in Macau, Mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough snow skin mooncakes are usually made and sold by bakeries, these mooncakes are not baked in ovens like traditional cakes. Unlike traditional mooncakes which are served at room temperature, snow skin mooncakes are typically eaten cold.\n\nThe crust of snow skin mooncake is made of glutinous rice, which is frozen. Snow skin mooncakes are typically white and are served cold, which is why they are named \"snow skin\". However, mooncakes may have other colors because of added flavors in their crusts. For example, if chocolate is added, the color of the crust might be brown.\n\nTraditional mooncakes are usually filled with salted duck egg yolks and lotus seed paste or red bean paste, while snow skin mooncakes can be filled with a variety of things such as mung bean paste, fruit, green tea, jam, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, cheese and other flavored fillings.\n\nSome other examples include:\n\nSnow skin mooncakes are usually packaged in plastic bags in pairs or individually. Because they are not baked, snow skin mooncakes must be refrigerated and can be stored in freezer for up to a few weeks. They are typically thawed for a few hours in a refrigerator before serving, to allow them to soften. Thawed mooncakes should be consumed within 2 hours. Refreezing is not advised.\n\nThe name \"snow skin mooncake\" refers to the original cake's translucent appearance, which made it appear as white as snow. The skin gives a \"cooling\" effect in the mouth. It is made without baking. The outer pastry \"skin\" of the mooncake is made of pre-cooked glutinous rice flour (糕粉). A high-quality snow skin mooncake can be stored for up to ten days unrefrigerated without getting moldy.\n\nThe snow skin mooncake was pioneered by Poh Guan Cake House (宝源饼家) in Singapore. In an interview with Lianhe Wanbao (Singapore Press Holdings) in 1989, founder and pastry chef Tian Jin He (田锦河) indicated that the snow skin mooncake had emerged 20 years prior (in the late 1960s). Snow skin mooncakes gradually become popular in the 1970s. A newspaper in 1980 reported that community centers were offering snow skin mooncake making courses. However, this version is a copy of Vietnamese mooncake. At that time the snow skin mooncake was also called a \"crystal mooncake\" (水晶月饼). The name \"Bing Pi Yue Bing\" (冰皮月饼) appeared in advertisements in the early 1980s.\n\nThe green-colored skin is made with the juice of the aromatic Pandan (Pandanus amaryllifolius) leaf, a popular and uniquely South-East Asian flavor. Many colours and flavours have been developed, making snow skin mooncakes even more popular.\n\n"}

It is \"lontong\" rice cake served with richly-flavoured dishes which includes \"opor ayam\" chicken in coconut milk, \"sayur lodeh\" vegetables soup, hot and spicy liver, hard boiled pindang egg, \"koya\" powder made of soy and dried shrimp or beef floss, pickles, chili paste and prawn cracker. \"Lontong cap go meh\" usually consumed by Chinese Indonesian community during Cap go meh celebration.\n\n\"Lontong cap go meh\" is actually not a single dish but more of a set of meal with several side dishes, served in similar fashion to \"nasi campur\" or \"nasi Bali\". It is a combination of several Javanese favourite dishes—each often prepared and cooked separately—and combined in a single plate prior of serving. The rich combination of flavourful dishes demonstrates the festive nature of the dish, which is traditionally consumed during Cap go meh in Java. The components of \"lontong cap go meh\" are:\n\nChinese cuisine influences on Indonesian cuisine is evident in Indonesian take on Chinese dishes, such as \"mie goreng, lumpia, bakso\" and \"siomay\". However the culinary influences also took another way around. Vice versa, peranakan Chinese Indonesian cuisine has also been influenced by native Indonesian cuisine. It is believed that \"lontong cap go meh\" is a peranakan Chinese Indonesian take on traditional Indonesian dishes.\n\nEarly Chinese immigrants in Indonesia settled in northern coastal cities of Java, such as Semarang, Pekalongan, Lasem, Tuban and Surabaya, as early as Majapahit period. During that time only male Chinese settled in Java and they intermarried with local Javanese women and create a Javanese-Chinese Peranakan culture. These early Chinese immigrants has become accustomed to the cooking of their Javanese wives. To celebrate Chinese New Year, during Cap go meh, peranakan of Java replaced the traditional \"yuanxiao\" (rice ball) with local \"lontong\" accompanied with array of Javanese dishes such as \"opor ayam\" and \"sambal goreng ati\" (spicy beef liver). It is believed that the dish reflect the assimilation among Chinese immigrants and local Javanese community. It is believed that \"lontong cap go meh\" conceived good fortune symbols; the thick rice cake is considered richer compared to thin watery \"bubur\" (rice congee) which is often associated as food of poors. The elongated form of \"lontong\" also symbolize longevity. While eggs symbolize good fortune and yellowish turmeric-coconut milk broth represents gold and fortune.\n\n\"Lontong Cap Go Meh\" was strictly a Peranakan-Javanese phenomena; peranakans in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo are not familiar with this dish. It is commonly associated with Imlek traditions of Chinese Indonesians in Javan cities, especially Semarang. Since Betawi people (native Jakartans) was also heavily influenced by Chinese Indonesian peranakan culture, \"Lontong Cap Go Meh\" is also considered as one of Betawi cuisine.\n\n\n"}

(), is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 83,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of Kraft Foods Inc. after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery-foods products. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the Latin word \"mundus\" (\"world\") and \"delez\", a fanciful modification of the word \"delicious\".\n\nThe company, headquartered near Chicago, manufactures chocolate, cookies, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Belvita, Chips Ahoy!, Nabisco, Oreo, Ritz, TUC, Triscuit, LU, Club Social, Barny, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Freia, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops), Tate's Bake Shop and Tang (powdered beverages).\n\nThe company has an annual revenue of about $26 billion and operates in approximately 160 countries. The company ranked No. 117 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\nMondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Toronto, Hamilton, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.\n\nMondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney and Edward E. Rieck. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.\n\nMcInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy. As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck-McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.\n\nNational Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:\n\nBorn in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was \"dismal\", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.\n\nIn 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.\nIn 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese. The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.\n\nIn 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:\n\nIn 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix. The following year, \"The New York Times\" reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.\n\nBy 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.\n\nAt the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.\n\nAlthough the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.\n\nIn 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.\n\nDuring World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly. Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.\n\nIn 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren's Imperial Cheese, was selected because \" ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years\". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), \"Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices. During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.\n\nIn 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: \"Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales.\" The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972; four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.\n\nIn 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.\nDuring the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Glädjé ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.\n\nAt the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.\n\nIn 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.\n\nIn 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.\n\nIn 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods. Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.\n\nInvestor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee. In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion. Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).\n\nIn February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock. On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nIn March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product. Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.\n\nFollowing trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.\n\nIn 2018, Reuters reported that \"In Mondelez International Inc’s (MDLZ.O) quarterly earnings call in January, Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said the company had become the leading chocolate maker in Russia.\" \n\nOn September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate. On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a \"derisory\" offer. Kraft renewed the offer on December 4. It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers. On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.\n\nThe Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits. Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury's presence in those markets. India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits. Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year. Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the \"logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company\" to build a \"global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals.\"\n\nThe Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico. As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children. Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.\n\nAt the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion. Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets. Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: \"We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world\".\n\nCadbury sales were flat after Kraft's acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition. Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012. Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, \"We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future\". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.\n\nOn March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was \"truly sorry\" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing. In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.\n\nKraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, \"South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate\". Before scuttling their New Zealand factory Mondelez removed over $100 million in dividends from their New Zealand branch, despite the company only posting modest profits.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.\n\nIn August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, an international snack-food company and a North American grocery company.\n\nThe snack-food company, Mondelez International, would be the legal successor of the old Kraft Foods, while the grocery company would be a new company, Kraft Foods Group. The split was completed in October 2012. It was structured so that Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez International and spun off Kraft Foods Group as a new publicly traded company. Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. \n\nIn 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts; the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Dirk Van de Put, Belgian CEO of McCain Foods, would succeed Irene Rosenfeld as CEO in November 2017.\n\nOn May 6, 2018, Mondelez agreed to buy cookie maker Tate's Bake Shop for approximately $500 million. The acquisition was completed in June 7, 2018.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Mondelēz International reported earnings of US$2.922 billion, with an annual revenue of US$25.896 billion, a decline of 0.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Mondelēz International's shares traded at over $42 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$58.8 billion in October 2018.\n\nIn 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies. When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as \"made with real vegetables\". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.\n\nThe lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. According to the American Heart Association, there is \"no safe level\" of trans fats in the diet.\n\nBased on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:\n\n\nKraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were \"made with real vegetables\", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as \"good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development\" and \"whole wheat\".\n\nAbout several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word \"wholesome\" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that \"wholesome,\" \"sensible\", and \"smart\" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful. The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.\n\nIn 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as \"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers\" The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.\n\nFor years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a \"forest criminal\" for destroying \"precious habitat\" in Indonesia's rain forest. In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for \"taking rainforest conservation seriously\".\n\nIn September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Mondelez and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world's two largest cocoa producers.\n\nThe report documents how in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies' laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country's elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200–400.\n\nIn November 2018, an investigation by Greenpeace International found that palm oil suppliers to Mondelez International cleared over 70,000 hectares of rainforest from 2015 to 2017.\n\nThe US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.\n\nIn September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.\n\nIn April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop. A \"Washington Post\" editorial credited the \"aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods\" with effectively addressing the danger. In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.\n\n"}

The process for manufacturing it was invented by Rowntree's in 1947. During manufacturing the fluid chocolate mass is foamed with a propellant, and then cooled in a low pressure environment. As the bubbles of gas expand they cool and help set the chocolate. This helps to maintain an even bubble distribution within the chocolate. Due to the isolating effect of the bubbles, air chocolate melts differently from compact bar chocolate — the mouthfeel is fragile-short at first, then as the chocolate is chewed it melts rapidly due to its bigger surface area. This intensifies the perception of taste.\n\nNitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are often used as propellants for air chocolate. Air itself is not used as a propellant because it contains oxygen which speeds up rancidification of the chocolate. A survey funded by Nestlé, conducted at the University of Reading, revealed that chocolate foamed with nitrogen — and especially with nitrous oxide — has the most intense taste. The researchers found that this was due to the larger bubbles which these gases produce. Further research by Nestlé has concluded that \"[t]he existing technology to control bubble size and distribution is difficult,\" which has led to experiments involving the creation of foams under zero-gravity conditions.\n\nIn 2013, Chinese scientists announced results from a study using phospholipids derived from soybeans to aerate cocoa butter.\n\n"}

The recipe is quite varied depending in which region of the Iberian peninsula it is prepared. Variations of this dish range from a recipe quite similar to Italian risotto, to a rice soup, to a dish that could be mistaken for paella.\n\nCaldoso always contains broth of any meat, some garlic and/or onions and short grain rice. Many recipes call for caramelised onions and in some recipes a small quantity of lentils are thrown in to help thicken the caldoso and add flavour.\n\nThis version calls for the addition of smoked paprika (pimenton) and one's choice of sea food (usually mussels, shrimp or clams) and extra water, which leaves it in a semi-liquid state. When served, the sea food is presented on top of the rice.\n\nThe mushroom variety calls for wild mushrooms (setas) to be fried separately from the caldoso. A cup of wine, sherry, port or dark beer and a small handful of red lentils are added to the caldoso while cooking. The rice is cooked until little liquid remains. Saffron or a strong cheese is added at the last moment and it is served by placing the separately fried mushrooms on top of the rice.\n\nCubes of meat are added to the caldoso as well as extra liquid (water or sherry) as well as smoked paprika or a spice of ones choice.

It was formerly referred to as \"Dutch cognac\" until that name was legally restricted to grape brandy from the Cognac region of France. Dutch names included \"Koetsiertje\" or \"Koetsierscognac\" (cognac drunk by carriage riders - Dutch \"koetsiers\") or \"Hollandse Cognac\" (Dutch Cognac). Its colour ranges from clear to dark brown, reflecting added caramel or artificial dye.\n\nDutch brandy is based on either grain or molasses alcohol, with added essences and extracts to produce a particular taste. These may include fusel oil, amyl alcohols, vanilla, esters, oak curls, prune extract and the concentrated liquids obtained from liquorice root (\"Glycyrrhiza glabra\", Dutch \"zoethoutwortel\").\n\nAny Dutch brandy is supposed to contain at least 35% of alcohol, and not more than 20 grammes of sugar per litre. Usually, a little real cognac, eau-de-vie or other grape-based distilled product is added. The brown colour of vieux can be obtained using caramel or an artificial colouring.\n\nAlthough the Treaty of Versailles (1919) already forbade the name \"Cognac\" from being applied to products produced outside of the French Cognac region, Dutch brandy continued to be sold using it until the 1960s. The packaging (often including stars) was clearly derived from cognac packaging. Pressure from the French government led to a specific Dutch law banning its use, ratified by the Dutch Supreme Court in a trade treaty with France on 1 June 1956.\n\nDutch brandy producers decided upon the name \"vieux\", French for \"old\", which had already been used before and which did not provide any pronunciation difficulties. The term is and was often used to describe old Dutch brandy (\"Cognac Vieux\").\n\nAlthough its manufacturers feared a decline in sales due to the name change, the opposite occurred. Older people prefer it in traditional ways, by itself or with coffee, younger mixed with cola.\n\nInitially Dutch brandy had a cheap public image, in spite of attempting to borrow Cognac's prestige. Most manufacturers sought to distance themselves from even their own product. Lucas Bols, for example, used the name \"Parade Vieux\" (with the Dutch advertisement slogan \"Pa pakt Parade\" – \"Dad picks Parade\"), and disclaimed production by crediting its production to \"Distillery Westertoren\" rather than the official name of their facility. After Dutch brandy's reputation improved the Parade name was changed to \"Bols Vieux\".\n\nIn 2009 Dutch brandy was the fifth most popular distilled beverage in the Netherlands by consumption percentage (after Jonge Jenever, whisky, liqueur and rum). Its 5.9% market share was on a par with Beerenburg).\n\nDutch brandy is made by a variety of distilleries, though several of them are owned (at least in name) by the Herman Jansen group (previously UTO). Vieux brands include Het Anker, Bestevaer, Bootz (made by Bols), Boots, Dujardin (made by Wenneker, who sell their regular 35% \"Dujardin Blue label\" as well as the more exclusive 38% \"Vieux Superieur Gold Label\"), Floryn, Henkes (made by Bols), Hooghoudt, Hoppe (made by Bols), Hulsink, Klasse A (house brand of Dutch liquor shop Mitra), De Kuyper, Legner Fine Vieille (not officially named \"Vieux\" as it only contains 30% of alcohol), Olifant and Plantiac (made by Boomsma).\n"}

At this time the cod must be kissed. Once this task is finished, the kisser must answer the question, \"Is ye a Screecher?\" The reply to this is, \"Deed I is, me old cock, and long may your big jib draw!\". This can be translated as \"Yes indeed, my friend, long may your big sail (i.e. jib) draw wind\", or \"may there always be wind in your sails.\" Afterwards the kisser must consume the shot of screech.

Originating in the Indian subcontinent, the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses. Although traditionally prepared as a decoction of green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, ground cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn together with black tea leaves, retail versions include tea bags for infusion, instant powdered mixtures, and concentrates.\n\nThe term \"chai\" ultimately originated from the Mandarin Chinese word for tea 茶 \"chá\" (The English word \"tea\", though, comes from the Hokkien Chinese \"tê\") and the Hindustani word “chai.” In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as \"masala chai\" or simply \"chai\", though the term refers to tea in general in the original language. Numerous coffee houses use the term chai latte or chai tea latte (essentially meaning ‘tea tea latte’) for their version to indicate that the steamed milk, much like a regular caffè latte, is mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. By 1994, the term had gained currency on the U.S. coffeehouse scene.\n\nTea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as an herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage. Some of the \"chai\" \"masala\" spice mixtures, or \"karha\" and \"Kashayam\" (Kha-shai-yam) that are still in current use, are derived from ancient Ayurvedic texts.\n\nIn the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around one pound (by weight) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in British India (50%) and British Ceylon (33%), present-day Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the (British-owned) Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent \"chai wallah\"s throughout the growing railway system.\n\nThe official promotion of tea was as served in the English mode, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, \"masala chai\" in its present form has now firmly established itself as a popular beverage.\n\nThe recipe or preparation method for masala chai is not fixed, and many families have their own versions of the tea. Most \"chai \"contains caffeine, typically one-third that of coffee (if made with a black tea base). The tea leaves steep in the hot water long enough to extract intense flavour, ideally without releasing the bitter tannins. Because of the large range of possible variations, \"masala chai\" can be considered a class of tea rather than a specific kind. However, all \"masala chai\" has four basic components: milk, sugar, cardamom, and ginger. The western adaption of chai, or chai latte, has a lighter and sweeter taste than the Indian version of a more herbal and spicier milk beverage.\n\nThe base tea is usually a strong black tea such as Assam, so the spices and sweeteners do not overpower it. Usually, a specific type of Assam is used called \"mamri\". Mamri tea has been cured in a special way that creates granules as opposed to \"leaf\" tea. It is inexpensive and the tea most often used in India. However, a wide variety of teas is used to make \"chai\". Most \"chai\" in India is brewed with strong black tea, but Kashmiri \"chai\" is brewed with gunpowder tea.\n\nThe traditional \"masala chai\" is a spiced beverage brewed with different proportions of warming spices. The spice mixture, called \"karha\", uses a base of ground ginger and green cardamom pods. Other spices are usually added to this \"karha\". For example, some \"masala chai\" found on the street, in restaurants, or in homes may also incorporate one or more of cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds, peppercorn, nutmeg, and cloves. In the Western world, using allspice, to either replace or complement the cinnamon and clove, is also common.\n\nTraditionally, cardamom and ginger play a dominant note, supplemented by other spices such as cloves, or black pepper; the latter two add a heat to the flavour and the utilization of cloves is more typical and popular throughout India. The traditional composition of spices often differs by climate and region in Southern and Southwestern Asia.\n\nFor example, in Western India, cloves and black pepper are expressly avoided. The Kashmiri version of \"chai\" is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of flavourings: almonds, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and sometimes saffron. In Bhopal, typically, a pinch of salt is added.\n\nOther possible ingredients include nutmeg, mace, black cardamom, chilli, coriander, rose flavouring (where rose petals are boiled along with the loose-leaf tea), or liquorice root. A small amount of cumin is also preferred by some people.\n\nTraditionally in India, water buffalo milk is used to make\" chai\". Outside of India, whole-fat cow's milk is usually used. Generally, \"masala chai\" is made by mixing one part milk with two to four parts water and heating the liquid to near boiling (or even full boiling). Some people like to use sweetened condensed milk in their \"masala chai\" to double as the sweetener. For those who prefer to drink \"chai\" without milk, the portion is replaced with water.\n\nPlain white sugar, Demerara sugar, other brown sugars, palm or coconut sugars, syrup, or honey is used. Jaggery is also used as a sweetener, mostly in rural parts of India. While some prefer unsweetened \"chai\", some sugar enhances the flavour of the spices.\n\nSome recipes use up to three tablespoons of sugar in 3½ cups of chai. Sugar is typically added to suit the drinker.\n\nThe simplest traditional method of preparing \"masala chai\" is through decoction, by actively simmering or boiling a mixture of milk and water with loose-leaf tea, sweeteners, and whole spices. Indian markets all over the world sell various brands of \"chai masala\", (Hindi चाय मसाला [\"chāy masālā\"], \"tea spice\") for this purpose, though many households or tea vendors, known in India as \"chai wallahs\", blend their own. The solid tea and spice residues are strained off from \"masala chai \"before serving.\n\nThe method may vary according to taste or local custom; for example, some households may combine all of the ingredients at the start, bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately strain and serve; others may leave the mixture simmering for a longer time, or begin by bringing the tea leaves to a boil and only add the spices toward the end (or vice versa).\n\nA common Maharashtrian practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of cardamom powder, cinnamon powder, ground cloves, ginger powder, and pepper powder. The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea is added. The \"chai\" is immediately taken off the heat, covered, and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes to allow the black tea to infuse into the \"chai\". The \"chai\" is then strained and served.\n\nMasala tea is a very popular beverage in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka). Small, roadside businesses called \"chai walla\", make and deliver tea to people's places of business in a \"chaidaan\", a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.\n\nMasala tea is a beverage that is consumed heavily all across Indian household. While most people like to consume it in the morning along with breakfast, it is also offered to any guests that visit.\n\nWith the demand increasing many startups in India have taken Tea stalls as a good business opportunity. There are now numerous larger food chains serving \"Masala Chai\" along with light snacks and are flourishing within office and college campus premises\n\nAs the popularity of masala chai has spread around the world, its nature has changed in various ways beyond the somewhat redundant terminology noted above.\n\"Masala chai\" is popular in East Africa, particularly on the coast. It is also quite popular in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; but it's locally known as Karak Tea or \"Chai Karak شاي كرك.\"\n\nLiquid \"chai concentrates\" have become very popular for their convenience, as these spiced, sweetened, tea-based syrups merely require dilution with milk, water, or both to create a flavourful hot or cold beverage. Most American coffeehouse chains use commercial liquid concentrates instead of brewing their own \"chai\" from scratch. Dry powdered or granular mixes similar to instant coffee are also commercially available. Chatillon Chai is a tea concentrate blend originating from the Basque region in the 18th century.\n\nBoth dry instant mixes and liquid concentrates can be replicated at home. A liquid concentrate can be made by brewing an unusually concentrated pot of highly spiced tea, so that the dilution of a small amount into a cup of hot water or a glass of cold milk results in roughly the same concentration of tea as in a normally proportioned brew; e.g., to make a syrup from which one ounce suffices to make one eight-ounce cup of normal chai when diluted, brew tea (and the proportional quantity of spices) at eight times normal concentration.\n\nSimilarly, unsweetened iced-tea powder can be tailored to individual taste with powdered spices, sugar, and (if desired for convenience and texture) dry nonfat milk and dry non-dairy creamer; the result can be mixed with hot water to produce a form of instant \"chai masala\". This form of dry mix has certain disadvantages, however; the powdered spices may leave a grainy residue at the bottom of the cup, and it may dissolve poorly in cold water, especially in the presence of dry milk/creamer powders.\n\nMany Western supermarkets offer teabags of \"chai\" which contain an assortment of ground \"chai\" spices and require steeping in hot water.\n\nSome American supermarkets also carry bottles of \"chai spice\" alongside their dried herbs and other spices. Unlike Indian spice mixtures, the American ones are generally made from powdered spices (cassia tends to be the dominant flavour) and sometimes sugar; this mixture can be added last minute to an already-brewed cup of tea as straining off the solids is not needed.\n\nAs an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold \"\"chai\"\" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a blender and topped with whipped cream. It is essentially different from the original version of a hot beverage.\n\nMany Western commercial preparations use nontraditional ingredients such as vanilla or chocolate, relegating the traditional \"masala \"spices to a relatively minor role.\n\nNon-tea-based variants may be prepared with herbal teas or with the South American beverage \"yerba mate.\n\nSome coffeehouses in the United States offer a version of \"masala chai\" augmented with espresso, but this beverage does not have any one universally recognised name. Depending on the establishment, it may be called \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", \"dirty chai\", or many other different names. However, despite the common use in many localities to use the term \"latte\" as an abbreviation of \"caffe latte\" (\"cafe latte\"), the term \"chai latte\" does not generally imply the presence of coffee in the beverage; see the discussion of the terminology above (literally, \"latte\" is Italian for \"milk\").\n\n"}

Oaxaca is one of Mexico's major gastronomic, historical, and gastro-historical centers whose cuisine is known internationally. Like the rest of Mexican cuisine, Oaxacan food is based on staples such as corn, beans and chile peppers, but there is a great variety of other ingredients and food preparations due to the influence of the state's varied geography and indigenous cultures. Corn and many beans were first cultivated in Oaxaca. Well known features of the cuisine include ingredients such as chocolate (often drunk in a hot preparation with spices and other flavorings), Oaxaca cheese, mezcal and grasshoppers (chapulines) with dishes such as tlayudas, Oaxacan style tamales and seven notable varieties of mole sauce. The cuisine has been praised and promoted by food experts such as Diana Kennedy and Rick Bayless and is part of the state's appeal for tourists.\n\nBecause of its mountain ranges, the state has a number of climates and cultures, which contributes to making the cuisine the most varied in Mexico. The state has coastal areas with seafood, the Central Valley region grows a wide variety of vegetables, and the area near Veracruz provides a year-round supply of tropical fruits. It also has seventeen recognized indigenous groups, who contribute their own cooking traditions. The cooking of each region in the state is characterized by local ingredients and to some extent cooking methods. One example is that of the Triques, who are known for their pit barbecuing. However, despite its rich culinary tradition, Oaxaca is a poor state and many struggle to eat decently.\n\nOaxaca's dietary staple is corn, which has been Mexico's for over 7,000 years. Corn is generally dried and ground to create a dough, which is used for a number of dishes including entomatadas, empanadas and tamales. Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of nearly every meal. The main flavoring agent is the chili pepper, with varieties such amarillos, chilhuacles, chilcostles and costeños, but the most distinctive is the pasilla oaxaqueña chile. Distinctive herbs include hoja santa, often used in chicken, pork, and fish dishes as well as mole verde, along with epazote and a local herb called “pitonia.” Two well known aspects of the cuisine are the use of chocolate for drinking and various edible insects, especially grasshoppers called chapulines (see below). Lesser known regional specialties include ice cream flavored with rose petals, and squash flowers found in empanadas, quesadillas, soups and more. \n\nAs for beans, Oaxacan cuisine prefers black beans in many varieties: cooked with aniseed and served in the form of soup, as a topping for street food, or with scrambled eggs in huevos con frijoles.\n\nAnother distinctive ingredient is Oaxaca cheese also called quesillo, used to make empanadas, tortas and tlayudas.\n\nOaxacan cooking varies region by region but a number of dishes can be found in nearly all parts of the state. Tlayudas are large chewy tortillas with toppings of beans, guacamole, meat or seafood and cheese. The most traditional Oaxacan tamales are large, wrapped in banana leaves with a mole filling. Other tamale varieties include amarillo (yellow), verde (green), rajas (chili pepper strips), chepil, elote (fresh corn) and dulce (sweet). In the Isthmus of Tehuantepec there is a variation with iguana meat and along the coast it can contain seafood. Oaxaca is famous for its chocolate, traditionally hand ground and combined with almonds, cinnamon and other ingredients, usually drunk as a hot beverage. Other well known Oaxacan dishes include chorizo oaxaqueño, tasajo, cecina enchilada, cocido oaxaqueño and various sauces such as molcajete, chintextle, borracha, chile pasilla, guajillo y ajo and gusanitos. Besides chocolate, other typical drinks include mezcal, various types of atole, champurrado and various fruit based drinks.\n\nThe culinary center of the state is its capital of the same name, Oaxaca, located in what is called the Central Valleys region. While the dominant indigenous group here has been the Zapotecs since the pre Hispanic period, there has been influence from other groups as well, such as the Mixtecs. The indigenous people of Oaxaca have grown corn, beans, squash and other crops for thousands of years. In rural, especially indigenous villages, households still depend heavily on these foods with few changes in how they are grown, mostly on small plots. The cooking here retains much of its indigenous flavor, such as dishes prepared without fat (unknown before the arrival of the Spanish) and the use of the valley's abundance of vegetables and herbs especially in its moles. However, as capital of the state, it also received influence from other parts of Oaxaca.\n\nThe best-known mezcal-producing area of the state is here, between the city of Oaxaca and Mitla, along the highway that leads to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Like tequila, mezcal is made with the cooked hearts of a species of the maguey or agave plant, but the flavor is very different. It has been described as smoky, and it is usually drunk straight. It comes in several varieties and can contain flavors such as almond, coffee and orange. A related traditional drink is aguamiel, the non-alcoholic sap of the maguey plant.\n\nMuch of this area's cuisine can be experienced in its many markets, both in the wide variety of ingredients for sale as well as pre-prepared foods to eat. All markets have areas with food stands. One of the best known of these is the 20 de Noviembre market, filled with food stands that prepare everything from various moles, to hot chocolate with pan de yema bread. It also includes a section specializing in meats such as tasajo and chorizo cooked to order and eaten with large corn tortillas, guacamole, and various grilled and fresh vegetables.\n\nDespite the Central Valley's geographic remoteness, the areas is one of Mexico's culinary capitals, with its food praised and promoted by food experts such as Alice Waters, Rick Bayless, Susana Trilling and Diana Kennedy. This promotion has helped to support the area's tourism industry, with people coming to experience the food. One attraction getting more attention is the “Food of the Gods Festival” in the capital city. In addition to food tastings, there are also cooking classes taught by local chefs. There is also wine and mezcal tasting, chocolate making, a coffee mill tour and tours to archeological sites and local crafts villages. A number of professional chefs are now based in the city of Oaxaca. This city has a number of upscale restaurants such as La Biznaga and Los Danzantes, run by professional chefs, but they all work to blend Oaxacan cooking with contemporary. They also all rely on local markets and farms for their ingredients. Susana Trilling is an author, chef and television host who runs the Seasons of My Heart cooking school in Oaxaca.\n\nOaxaca is an important producer and exporter of coffee, but the more important drink is chocolate. Oaxaca is one of the Mexican states that produces cacao, along with Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, Morelos, Guerrero and Michoacán. Cacao and chocolate have been used in the state as food, drink and medicine. In the past the cacao beans served as a form of money.\n\nIn the center of the city of Oaxaca, various businesses grind and prepare cacao for hot chocolate drinks, moles, and more. The best known of these businesses is El Mayordomo. Inside, their large mills grind beans that are then mixed with sugar and other flavorings such as almonds and cinnamon. Most of the cacao is processed for drinking. Hot chocolate is prepared with the chocolate mixture with water or milk and heated in a pot or pitcher. Before serving, a froth is created with a special instrument is twirled rapidly by rubbing the handles between the palms. The resulting cacao beverage with the froth is named Pozonque.\n\nThough most chocolate is consumed as a hot beverage, it is also an important ingredient in a cold beverage called tejate. It is made with fermented corn, cacao, and the seed of the mamey fruit. It is traditionally served in dried and painted gourds. Tejate is usually found in the towns just outside the city of Oaxaca. It is similar to the pozol of Chiapas. The drink was previously considered a complete meal. However, tejate is becoming less common and harder to find.\n\nOaxaca has over 200 known preparations for mole, a complicated sauce based on one or more chili peppers. However, seven are most notable, giving the state the nickname of “land of the seven moles.” Oaxacan moles require multiple ingredients and long cooking time, and for this reason are traditionally served only for special occasions. Ingredients for moles were traditionally prepared ground on a metate; however today, they are usually made with the help of blenders and food mills, which grind and mix many of the ingredients. Depending on the ingredients, they are toasted or fried then mixed with others to make a sauce that is then simmered. Recipes vary from cook to cook. While chocolate is used in two of the seven moles, it is not the most important ingredient. Oaxacan moles are served with chicken, pork and beef; however, the sauce is more important in a mole dish than the meat.\n\nThe name, color and ingredients distinguish the seven main moles of Oaxaca, called negro (black), amarillo (yellow), coloradito (little red or red-colored), mancha manteles (tablecloth stainer), chichilo (named after the main pepper), rojo (red) and verde (green). All of the moles, except verde, can be kept as a paste and cooked later diluted with chicken broth. Mole negro is the best known and most complicated of the preparation, containing anywhere from twenty to thirty-plus ingredients, depending on the recipe. Mole negro is slightly sweet, black in color and contains six different types of chili peppers, plantains, onion, tomatoes, tomatillos, cloves, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, tortillas, avocado leaves and more depending on the recipe. To gain the desired black color, the chili peppers have to be well toasted but not burnt. Mole amarillo contains green tomatoes, onion, garlic, cumin, cloves, ancho chili peppers, guajillo chili peppers, hoja santa or cilantro and is garnished with onions, lime and oregano. Mole coloradito is brick red in color and contains ancho chili peppers, tomatoes, garlic, sesame seeds, almonds, cinnamon and oregano. Mancha mantales is red and uses ancho chili peppers, tomatoes, garlic, onion, thyme, cloves and almonds. Another red mole is chichilo, which uses chihuacle, negro, pasilla and mulato chile peppers, tomatoes, marjoram, allspice, cloves and avocado leaves. Rojo is red as its name suggests with ingredients such as chocolate, guajillo chili peppers, onion, tomatoes, garlic, oregano, nuts and sesame seeds. Mole verde contains tomatillos, green chili peppers, onion, garlic, cumin, cloves, ancho and guajillo chili peppers, hoja santa, epazote and parsley. It has a light and herby taste. Of the sauces, verde is the easiest to create as it does not require the toasting and rehydration of chili peppers.\n\nVarious insects are consumed in the state including ants and grubs from maguey plants but the best known of these is grasshoppers, called chapulines. Although eaten in other parts of Mexico, chapulines are most popular in the Central Valleys area of Oaxaca. They are an important source of protein in the rural areas and a delicacy in the city of Oaxaca. They have been eaten since well before the arrival of the Spanish and are generally eaten as a condiment, snack food and sometimes the main dish. Their preparation and sale is a full-time occupation for many and an important source of income for many rural families. They are even shipped to the United States.\n\nGrasshoppers that are consumed are collected from corn and alfalfa fields. They are semi-domesticated, living longer and reproducing at higher rates than those living in wild areas. The harvest season for the insects is during the rainy season, late spring to early winter. This harvest season begins with the hatching of new grasshoppers, called nymphs in English and taste sweet, commanding a premium price. Older grasshoppers tend to have a slightly bitter taste.\n\nClean grasshoppers are cooked by immersing them into boiling water seasoned with garlic and lime. The most common way to eat them is fresh off the comal and with a tortilla, but they are also eaten fried with chili powder as a snack (especially with mezcal) and can be found in more sophisticated preparations, in a sauce or mixed with eggs.\n"}

TLDC produce English whisky, London gin and British spirits, compounds and cordials. TLDC also creates experimental spirits under the TESTBED brand; named after the art space of similar ethos by architect Will Alsop.\n\nThe company was founded in 2011 by Darren Rook, and angel investment expert and former microbrewery owner, Nick Taylor. TLDC is London’s first whisky distillery since the Lea Valley distillery closed in 1903.\n\nIn 1807 Ralph Dodd proposed to build a distillery in Nine Elms, London. The company, to be called The London Distillery Company, took receipt of monies and share subscriptions for transferable shares. Dodd created a board of directors from prominent peers and engineers, partly prompted by Dodd's involvement with an 1806 business proposal for the Vauxhall Bridge Company.\n\nThe board of directors comprised: James Heygate, Ralph Dodd, John Taylor, William Clay, William Norris, Fenwick Bulmer, Samuel Sharpe, John Moore, Matthew Wilson, James Norris, John Calvert Clarke, Thomas Rolle, Abraham Walker, John Moore and Christopher Dunkin.\n\nFollowing a complaint by a prominent Essex-based corn distillery headed by Tory MP Philip Metcalfe the English Crown brought a case against Dodd and The London Distillery Company under the 1720 Bubble Act. This was after raising funds, assembling staff and acquiring the Old Water Mill at Nine Elms on the Thames for £12,000. As the first case to be made under this act the Crown hired barrister Sir William Garrow as prosecutor. Dodd lost the case and the business was disbanded.\n\nThe London Distillery Company Ltd filed dormant trading accounts from June 2011 to March 2012.\n\nStarting in early November 2011 TLDC took part in investment network Envestors Ltd's Rising Stars initiative to raise £250,000 against 45% equity. By late January 2012, TLDC had raised £150,000 through the Envestors network and friends and family of both founders. As traditional investment slowed down they decided to seek funding on crowd funding website Crowdcube to help raise a further £100,000.\n\nTLDC uses two 2,200 litre stainless steel fermenters from Christian CARL.\n\nTLDC uses traditional London yeast varieties such as Whitbread B and Young's which are propagated as a liquid yeast slurry by Surebrew. Both were used for early stage fermentation trails in December 2013.\n\nThe London Distillery Company Ltd currently operates two pot stills.\n\nFor whisky production they distill on a 650 litres copper pot still with 4 plate distillation column which was manufactured in Stuttgart Germany. Manufactured by Christian CARL GmbH, Germany’s oldest distillery fabricator since 1869, the stillhead was designed by Darren Rook.\n\nIn collaboration with Dr Jason Grizzanti the Company pioneered a new gin category: Anglo-American Gin, acting as a crossover between the juniper-forward London Dry Gins and the more experimental New Western styles of American gins.\n\nThe first release from the TESTBED range gives people the opportunity to chart the various stages of gin development. The gin gets its distinct complexity from varying proportions of unique, organic botanicals – including bilberry, lovage root and lavender. South London freelance artist Jasmin Ford illustrated the package artwork.\n\nThe 109 casks were launched in November 2012 as a part of The London Distillery Company's involvement with the men's health charity Movember.\n\n\n \n"}

Rice and gravy is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot for a long time in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any other meat can be used in its preparation. Fattier cuts of beef and pork, as well as chicken, squirrel, rabbit, turkey necks, wild pig, and duck lend themselves more easily to the making of the gravy, while venison and leaner cuts of beef and pork are more difficult to make tender, but can be helped by adding andouille sausage or cured pork tasso to the dish during the browning or smothering process. Often the meat is cooked with the Cajun holy trinity, a mirepoix variant of onions, bell peppers, and celery in roughly equal quantities, although other vegetables can also be used.\n\nOriginally a dish favored by farmers and laborers, it is now often served in local plate lunch houses. \"Raised on Rice and Gravy\", a 2009 documentary film by Conni Castille and Allison Bohl, chronicles the prevalence of the dish at local plate lunch houses and its enduring popularity in Acadiana cuisine.

The company's products include traditional wagashi, as well as newer offerings, such as mochi ice cream. Mochi ice cream, which was created by Mikawaya's former CEO and President Frances Hashimoto, now represents the majority of Mikawaya's annual sales.\n\nMikawaya was founded as a small, traditional Japanese wagashi confectionery store in Los Angeles in 1910. In 1942, The owners of the family-owned business, husband and wife Koroku and Haru Hashimoto, were forced to close their business with the outbreak of World War II. Koroku and Haru Hashimoto were interned and sent to the Poston War Relocation Center in Poston, Arizona. They returned to Los Angeles following their release and the end of the war. The Hashimotos reopened Mikawaya at 244 E. First Street in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo neighborhood on December 23, 1945.\n\nFrances Hashimoto became CEO of Mikawaya in 1970 when she was just 27 years old. Her father had recently died and her mother asked her to join the family-run confectionery business. Hashimoto, who was working as an elementary school teacher at the time, considered her decision for six months before leaving teaching and joining Mikawaya.\n\nHashimoto sought to expand the family's business from one location in Little Tokyo to a multi-store enterprise. In 1974, she opened a second bakery location on Fourth Street in Los Angeles. Under Hashimoto, who served as CEO and president, Mikawaya expanded to include additional locations in Little Tokyo, Torrance, California, Gardena, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii. The company's flagship store is currently located at the Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo, as of 2012.\n\nFrances Hashimoto is credited as the inventor of the popular mochi ice cream. She also spearheaded the line's introduction the American market through Mikawaya. Hashimoto's husband, Joel Friedman, initially conceived the idea of wrapping small orbs of ice cream with a coating of mochi, a sweet Japanese rice cake, during the early 1990s. Hashimoto expanded on the idea, offering seven flavors of mochi ice cream made by Mikawaya. The mochi ice cream line proved a hit with consumers, expanding Mikawaya from more traditional Japanese pastries like chestnut buns or rice cakes. Mikawaya now sells its mochi ice cream in Albertsons, Trader Joe's, Ralphs, and Safeway. Mochi ice cream now accounts for the majority of Mikawaya's sales.\n\n\n"}

(abbreviated as FIFCO) is a Costa Rican food and beverages company headquartered in the province of Heredia, Costa Rica. It has a catalog of over 2000 products, sold in over 15 countries.\n\nFIFCO is structured as a holding company with three subsidiaries: Florida Bebidas (food and beverages), Florida Capitales (investments in bottling facilities), and Florida Inmobiliaria (investments in resort hotels).\n\nIn 1908 two brothers of Jamaican origin, Rupert Cecilio and Stanley Lindo Morales, founded a company in Siquirres, the third canton in the province of Limón, one of seven provinces in Costa Rica. The newly formed company was dedicated to agriculture and the making of ice. The \"finca\" (property) in which the company was located was called \"La Florida\", from which the company took its name of \"Florida Ice and Farm Company\". The brothers used an English name due to the fact that English was their native tongue, as it was for many Caribbean migrants who lived in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica. With that same company, they purchased the brewery and beverages business owned by José Traube in 1912. This is how a company that was mainly an agricultural concern entered the beverages market.\nIn 1958, the company purchased Cervecería Ortega. Founded in 1910 by the Ortega Family of Spanish origin, the Ortega brewery had been one of the main competitors with brands such as Imperial and Bavaria. The consolidation of these breweries allowed FIFCO to make investments in a new brewery and bottling plant which it called “Cervecería Costa Rica” in 1966. The plant is located in Río Segundo de Alajuela.\n\nIn 1979 the company went public and commenced trading on the Bolsa Nacional de Valores (the Costa Rican National Stock Exchange).\n\nIn 1995 FIFCO introduced the \"Rock Ice\" beer to the local market, which highlighted the innovative use of \"ice brewing\". In 1998 the company acquired “Cervecería Tropical”. In 2001, the company introduced its line of fruit refreshments \"Tropical\", and also began distributing the Tampico brand locally.\n\nIn 2006 the company purchased Industrias Alimenticias Kern's y Compañía S.C.A. for $86 million. The move further diversified its operations and brought along with it the canned beans, sauces, and pasta products under the Kern’s and Ducal brands.\n\nIn 2007, FIFCO purchased the operations of SAB Miller in Costa Rica for $116 million USD. The purchase included the distribution rights for Pepsi Cola in the country, as well as some real estate investments.\n\nIn 2008 after two years of the opening of political relationships between China and Costa Rica, the company signed a contract with Tsingtao that allowed it to start exporting its beer and refreshments into China, as well as importing Chinese beverages into Costa Rica.\n\nIn 2011 FIFCO purchased Corporación Musmanni, a large bakery chain in Costa Rica with franchisees in Central America and the Caribbean. In March 2012 the company entered the dairy market with the purchase of Coopeleche R.L.; the move put pressure on Cooperativa de Productores de Leche R.L. (Dos Pinos) which has dominated the Costa Rican dairy market for years.\n\nIn October 2012 FIFCO purchased North American Breweries Holdings (NAB) from KPS Capital Partners, for $388 million USD through its subsidiary Cervecería Costa Rica S. A. NAB sells Genesee and Labatt beer in the United States, as well as craft or small batch beers including Honey Brown Lager, Magic Hat and Pyramid.\n\nUnder contract FIFCO brews Heineken beer at its facility at La Ribera de Belen.\n\n"}

It is named after the village of Fucking in Austria; \"hell\" is the German word for 'pale' and a typical description of this kind of beer. The beer's name was initially controversial. Both the local authorities in Fucking and the European Union's Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office initially objected to the name. It was eventually accepted and the lager is now sold internationally.\n\nFucking Hell is not brewed in Fucking, but was originally brewed in the Brauerei Waldhaus, a brewery in the Black Forest town of Waldhaus, Weilheim in Germany. From 2013, production moved to the Brauerei Hartmannsdorf in Hartmannsdorf, near Chemnitz. At the time of the launch of Fucking Hell, there was no brewery in the village of Fucking.\n\nTechnically, Fucking Hell is a \"Pilsner\" and is not considered to be a true \"Hellbier\", as beers brewed in the traditional Munich style have a malted taste and are slightly darker in appearance.\n\nIn 2010, three German businessmen, Stefan Fellenberg, Florian Krause and Hans-Jörg Schaller devised a plan to bring a new beer to market. Krause was originally from Bad Reichenhall, a Bavarian town only 20 km over the border from the Austrian village of Fucking. The village's name inspired them to devise a humorous brand name, combined with the German word \"Hell\" for 'pale lager', and they applied to register a Community Trade Mark for \"Fucking Hell\".\n\nThe European Union's Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office initially refused to grant a trademark for the beer on the grounds that it contained an expletive. However, Fellenberg and Krause argued that the name referred to the village in Austria and that \"Hell\" was an Austrian and Southern German term for pale lager. The Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office then permitted the registration of the trademark, stating that the name was \"an interjection used to express a deprecation, but it does not indicate against whom the deprecation is directed, nor can it be considered as reprehensible to use existing place names in a targeted manner (as a reference to the place), merely because this may have an ambiguous meaning in other languages.\"\n\nFellenberg and Krause intended to use the trademark as a brand name and use it to produce Fucking Hell branded food and clothing. The beer went on sale in Europe, Asia and Australia in 2011.\n\n\n"}

Avyakta as a category along with \"Mahat\" (Cosmic Intelligence) and Purusa plays an important role in the later Samkhya philosophy even though the Bhagavad Gita III.42 retaining the psychological categories altogether drops out the \"Mahat\" and the \"Avyakta\" (Unmanifest), the two objective categories.\n\nCharaka gives six elements or \"dhatus\" by adding \"Chetana\" to the five elements \"earth\", \"water\", \"fire\", \"air\" and \"akasa\". \"Chetana\" is identified with Purusa and the \"Avyakta-part\" of \"Prakrti\" treated as one category and called Paramatman. It is when \"Purusa\" or \"Chetana\" is connected with the body of senses and mind that consciousness can come to the self; consciousness is a phenomenon of the soul-mind-body complex. According to Bhagavad Gita XIII.1-2, \"Vikara\" or the evolutionary products of \"Prakrti\" are the \"Ksetras\" (Field) (Living organisms) and the \"Avyakta-part\" of \"Purusa\" or \"Chetana\" or \"Paramatman\" is the \"Ksetragna\" (Knower of the Field) (the individual self) (the Supreme Self).\n\nAccording to Sushruta’s views on the evolutionary process set in motion by Consciousness, \"Mahan\" (Intellect) is generated from \"Avyakta\" or \"mula-prakrti\", from that \"Mahan\", \"Ahamkara\" (Ego) is produced having the same qualities, and from \"Ahamkara\" are produced the twenty four elements that are \"achetana\" (unconscious) in nature, and the twenty-fifth element is the Jiva (Purusa or soul).\n\nPaingala Upanishad, extending the instructions of the Mandukya Upanishad states that the \"mula-prakrti\" (body) becomes animated by associating with the witnessing consciousness which is the conditioned Brahman, and begins to evolve. Its first evolute is \"Avyakta\" which has \"Ishvara-consciousness\" as its subject animating soul. Pure consciousness of Brahman descends into or becomes \"Ishvara - self\" with \"Avyakta\" as the body. Thus, at that stage of evolution the \"Avyakta\" is the \"causal body\".\n\n\"Maya\", a Vedantic metamorphosis of the Samkhya Prakrti, is called \"Avyakta\", not manifest, devoid of form etc., because one cannot obtain awareness of it by sense-perception and it cannot be seen in its native or true nature. It is to be inferred from its effects by persons whose intellect functions in accord with the declarations of Sruti. In its special condition it is spoken of as \"Susupti\" (\"dreamless sleep\") when in it the \"buddhi\" (Intellect) and the \"indriyas\" (senses) are completely dissolved and cease to function, when all \"parmanas\" (sources of knowledge) are still, and \"buddhi\" remains only in the form of a seed, the test of this is the universal verdict – \"I did not know anything (while asleep)\". \"Maya\" is the power of Ishvara or the conditioned Brahman as Saguna Brahman to create, which power is unimaginable and wonderful. It is the power to create drawn from the unconditioned Brahman or Nirguna Brahman, for effect without cause is impossible. \"Avyakta\" or \"Maya\" is \"beginningless avidya\", it has no reality in the absolute sense and is destroyed by knowledge. It is compacted in three \"gunas\" - \"sattva\", \"rajas\" and \"tamas\", which by themselves are its constituents. \"Maya\" is of the nature of these three \"gunas\" and is superior to its effects. By virtue of being the cause of all transformations beginning with akasa and by virtue of the sruti which intimates the evolutions brought about by \"iksana\" (\"seeing\", \"thinking\"), \"samkalpa\" (\"purposing\") and \"parinama\" (\"transformation\"), \"Maya\" is established Shvetashvatara Upanishad - \"Know that Maya is Prakrti and Maheswara to be the Mayain, the wielder of Maya\"). It gives birth to this world. \"Maya\" is responsible for the reflected being of Ishvara and \"Avidya\" for the reflection that is the \"Jiva\". From \"Maya\" is born everything from the \"Mahat\" to \"Brahmanda\" that is known as the \"Karanasarira\" or the \"Causal body of the atman\". The \"Karana sarira\" is called \"avyakta\" because not being available for sense-perception it is to be inferred from its effects.- Vivekachudamani.110, 122, 123\n\nThe Doctrine of Maya is not a fabrication of Adi Shankara. In the Rig Veda and the Upanishads \"Maya\" is generally meant \"power\"; it is in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad that \"Maya\" is identified with \"Prakrti\" and brought in to mean \"illusion\", and in the Bhagavad Gita, as \"magical power\". Adi Shankara does not accept the Samkhya view that \"Avyakta\" signifies \"Pradhana\" in its unmanifested state because the sage of the Katha Upanishad I.iii.10-11 does not define \"Avykta\" as \"Pradhana\", nor indicates what should be known by this word. Primarily, \"Avyakta\" denotes \"the antecedent seed stage of this world\" in which it is not manifested by names and forms. Shankara replaces \"Pradhana\" as definition of seed is of the nature of \"Avidya\" and is signified by the word \"Avyakta\", and having the supreme Lord (Brahman) as its ground is of the nature of \"Maya\" and is the great sleep in which transmigratory souls unaware of their form continue to slumber on.\n\nWhen they first evolve from \"Avyakta\" the five subtle elements, then unable to participate in any action, do not have a form, later on out of these five only earth, water and fire acquire corporeality. The composition of \"Akasa\" containing the greatest amount of \"sattva\" was duly considered by the Upanishadic thinkers but the composition of \"Time\" which is dependent on \"space\" was left unconsidered. Lokacharya of the Vishishtadvaita school regarded Time as the cause of transformation of \"Prakrti\" and its mutation, but Srinivasa regarded the invisible incorporeal Time, which is an object of perception through the six sense-organs, as matter devoid of the three gunas, and that Time that is eternal in the transcendental abode of God is non-eternal in the world. The Advaita School regards the world and therefore all substances as appearance due to an undefinable principle called the \"Cosmic Nescience\" or \"Maya\", which is neither real nor unreal but undefinable. The Advaitins connect Time with the empirical world alone. As creation means the appearance of names and forms, they cannot exist before creation; also the difference between objects of the same class can have no reference to Sat, the \"non-existent\" simply does not exist.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita declares that – \"Far beyond even this Avyakta (the Unmanfest referred to in the earlier Verse 18) there is yet another unmanifest Existence, that Supreme being who does not perish. The same Unmanifest which has been spoken of as the Indestructible is also called the supreme goal; that again is My supreme Abode, attaining which they return not to this mortal world.\" Thus, the Sruti and the Smrti both declare the existence of \"Avyakta\" which as \"Maya\" is the \"upadhi\" of Ishvara; the five sheaths (Panchakosa-sarira) which are the effects of \"Maya\" are the \"upadhis\" of Jiva, when these \"upadhis\" are effectively removed there is no \"Ishvara\" and no \"jiva\"- Vivekachudamani.245-6.\n"}

Czech folklore was influenced by a mix of Christian and pagan customs. Nowadays it is preserved and kept alive by various folklore ensembles uniting members of all ages, from children to seniors, showing their talent during competitions, folklore festivals or other performances. \n\nThe Czech Republic is divided into a number of ethnographic regions. Each of them has special folklore traditions, songs or costumes and specializes in different crafts. As a result, Czech folklore provides a diverse source of entertainment.\n\nMusic played an important part in life of common people or peasants in the Czech Republic. It offered both means of expression and a vent for their emotions. Resulting music varies not only by the region of its origin but also in the purpose of its use. Therefore, there are myriads of distinct folk songs.\nMusic often addressed everyday issues and was passed down orally. From the 19th century onward it was recorded by etnographs. Traditional celebrations such as welcome of the spring, successful harvest are still among the occasions traditionally celebrated with songs. More lively themes were used specifically during celebrations, weddings or feasts. Funerals and mournful occasions also had their own set of songs and tunes. \n\nSongs and especially dances were often linked to conscription of Czech young men to the Army; they are called “verbuňk” in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened during wartimes and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music. They are listed by UNESCO in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThere are a number of instruments associated with Czech folk music, which add to its distinct sound – violin and the double bass; instruments specific to Bohemia and Moravia such as bagpipes (bock), shepherd’s pipe, dulcimer and trumpet. \n\nAll of them are still in active use by the folklore groups during their shows.\n\nPolka dance originated in Bohemia and still remains an integral part of folklore traditions especially in the western part of the country. Since the 19th century this dance has spread from Bohemia to many neighbouring European countries as well as overseas.\n\nIn the past, emphasis was placed on changes connected to the four seasons of the year; every season had its own specific traditions. In the spring, people practiced customs which would ensure health of their crops and future successful harvest. In the winter, it was most important to protect households and villagers against adverse effects of cold weather and supernatural forces. \n\nMany Czech regions still hold traditional celebrations, which also revel in folklore music, dance and costumes. Among the most typical is Drowning of Morana, Shrovetide, erecting the maypole, grape harvest or celebration of Easter. \n\n\nFolklore is not merely about music. Czech folklore is characteristic for elaborate traditional costumes distinctive to each region or even village.\n\nSpecific aspects such as colors, embroidery, themes and fragments of traditional costumes varied on the basis of social, geographical and symbolical factors as well as according to the purpose of their use. Costumes worn on special occasions were usually lavishly decorated, colorful and accompanied with a wide range of accessories (scarves, ribbons, headdresses, hats, belts, etc.) while everyday clothes tended to be rather simple and practical. Every region had a set of amusing peculiarities. For example:\n\n\nTraditional costumes are no longer commonly worn in most parts of the Czech Republic. They may be used during traditional celebrations or festivals when worn by members of folklore ensembles. In some families, costumes are handed down from generation to generation as they wish to preserve the tradition. Likewise, many stay protected in museums and private collections.\n\nMultiple folklore shows and festivals are organized in the Czech Republic throughout the year. They are a display of rich Czech traditions and folklore. At the festivals, various folklore groups demonstrate the heritage of their country. The performers are presented in traditional costumes particular to different regions of the Czech Republic. They perform folk dances, traditional folk songs and play musical instruments. Many festivals are not only demonstrations of music and dances, but also show traditional cuisine and crafts.\n\nThere are many folklore festivals in the Czech Republic.\n\nCzech Republic is abundant in folklore groups of all kinds. Their goal is to preserve local traditions and folklore and to pass the heritage on to the following generations. Members of the folklore groups are enthusiasts of all ages: from little children through adolescents to adults. They all enjoy building up folklore spirit with dances, music and showing off beautiful folklore dresses, as well as performing in front of audiences at folklore festivals. Children are encouraged to participate in folklore ensembles from a very early age.\n\nTraditional arts and crafts are an inseparable part of Czech folklore. \n\n\n"}

Most laws allow sneak boats to be paddled to increase the speed need to reach open water rafts of ducks. These boats often have some type of fall-away concealment which the hunter drops down at the last second to improve the range of the wing shooting. This is a sport with a long history going back to market hunters and punt boats with small cannons mounted to them. Sometimes the boats are referred to as a sneakbox which seen great use on the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes\n\nOther versions of sneak boats are called sculling boats which use a paddle protruding out of the transom of the boat allowing the hunter to lay flat while sculling the boat into rafted waterfowl.\n\nThe main focus of the sneak boat is to put the hunter very close to the decoys or rafts of live waterfowl if not directly into them for additional closer shooting. This makes for very dramatic hunting scenarios where rafting waterfowl comes extremely close to the hunter and boat.\n\nMost sneak boats are used for diver duck or ocean duck hunting where an open deep water waterfowl species frequent. Sometimes they are deployed in marshes for more traditional puddle duck hunting or goose hunting. They are also referred to as sculling.\n\nOpen water sneak boat hunters are well known to be a hearty bunch and are known for operating on the riskier side of waterfowl hunting. They are known to target diver ducks such as bluebills (greater scaup), canvasback, goldeneye, scoter and eider to name a few.\n\nThese boats are known to be long and sleek to cut through the water fast and have extremely shallow drafts. Boats rang from 10 ft to upwards of 21 ft on the great lakes and rivers. They usually accompany two hunters at a time using the wind to catch a sail like blind in the front of the boat while also sculling to achieve greater speed.\n\nSneak boat hunters sometimes uses small spreads of decoys in open water while they lay and wait some distance away watching with binoculars. Once ducks have landed into the decoy spread the hunters begin their sneak. To waterfowl the boat is just some driftwood or breakaway marsh. Other sneak boat hunter use large cabin cruiser as a base and perform sneaks using several sneak boats and a tender boat to allow quick retrieval.\n\n"}

In 1913, at 214 E. 3rd Street, Sterling, Hey Brothers built the “largest and most modern plant of the kind in northern Illinois.”\n\nIn 1937, Hey Brothers gained recognition for building a “modern dairy barn” and “the first electronic milking parlor in Illinois” with the following innovations: electrified fly killing doors, hot and cold running water, a glass barrier creating a separate and sanitary milk parlor, vacuum lines(DeLaval system), and electric milk cooling tank. (The “2008 Whiteside County Barn Tour” featured this Hey barn.) Beginning in the 1930‘s, to obtain premium milk, innovative Hey Brothers purchased electric milk coolers for farmers, and then paid the farmers extra for their milk, which allowed the farmers to pay off the milk coolers with the bonus.\n\nIn 1937, the Illinois Supreme Court sided with Hey Brothers against the City of Rockford and invalidated an ordinance requiring state licensed companies to buy yet another license from Rockford.

{"id": "38329935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38329935", "title": "Magnetic Tower of Hanoi", "text": "Magnetic Tower of Hanoi\n\nThe Magnetic Tower of Hanoi (MToH) puzzle is a variation of the classical Tower of Hanoi puzzle (ToH), where each disk has two distinct sides, for example, with different colors \"red\" and \"blue\". The rules of the MToH puzzle are the same as the rules of the original puzzle, with the added constraints that each disk is flipped as it is moved, and that two disks may not be placed one on another if their touching sides have the same color. Each disk has a North and South pole, with similar poles repelling one another and opposite poles attracting one another.\nMagnets inside each disk physically prevent illegal moves.\n\nOne of the striking features of the classical ToH puzzle is its relation to the base 2: the minimum number of total moves required to solve the puzzle is 2 − 1 (where \"n\" is the number of disks), while the minimum number of moves made by disk \"k\" is 2 (disks are numbered bottom up so that \"k\" = 1 being the largest disk, and \"k\" = \"n\" being the smallest). It will be shown below that just as the original ToH puzzle is related to base 2, so the MToH is related to base 3, though in a more complex manner.\n\nMathematically equivalent puzzles to certain variations of the MToH have been known for some time. For example, an equivalent puzzle to one of the colored variations of the MToH appears in Concrete Mathematics. In this puzzle moves are only allowed between certain posts, which is equivalent to assigning permanent colors to the posts (e.g. if two posts have the same permanent color assigned to them, then direct moves are not allowed between the two posts).\n\nThe free (non-colored) MToH first appeared publicly on the internet around 2000 (though under the name of \"Domino Hanoi\") as part of a detailed review by the Mathematician Fred Lunnon of the different variations of the original Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n\nThe MToH was independently invented by the Physicist Uri Levy in the summer of 1984, who also coined the name and the analogy to magnetism.\nDr Levy later published a series of papers \n\nThe MToH puzzle consists of three posts labeled source (S), destination (D), and intermediate (I), and a stack of \"n\" different sized disks with each side of a disk having a different color, either Red or Blue. At the beginning of the puzzle the disks are stacked on the S post in order of decreasing size (i.e. the largest disk is at the bottom), and such that all disks have their Red side facing upwards. The objective of the puzzle (in its \"basic\" version) is to move the entire stack, one disk at a time, to the D post, maintaining the order from largest to smallest disk, but with the Blue sides facing upwards.\n\nThe rules governing the movement of the disks are as follows:\n\nIn order to illustrate the rules of the MToH, and also show the route to a more general solution, it is useful to work through examples for \"n\" = 2 and \"n\" = 3. For the case of \"n\" = 2, four steps are required, as shown in the accompanying figure, compared to 3 steps in the \"n\" = 2 case of the original ToH. The extra step is required due to the fact that after the second step the small disk cannot be moved directly from the I post to the D post, as this would mean that its Blue side would be facing downwards. Thus, an extra step is required to flip the color of the small disk, so that it can then be placed on the D post with its Blue side facing upwards.\n\nFor the \"n\" = 3 case, the solution involves the following steps:\nThis first stage is similar to the \"n\" = 2 puzzle described above, which also takes four moves, where the D and I posts are interchanged. Note however, that it is not identical to the \"n\" = 2 puzzle due to the presence of the large disk on the S post, which \"colors\" it red. This means that a disk can only be placed on this post with its red side facing upwards.\nAt this stage one might be tempted to again make use of the \"n\" = 2 puzzle, and try and move disks 2 and 3 from I to D in 4 moves. However, here again care is needed. Due to the presence of disk 1 on D, D is now \"colored\" Blue, i.e. another disk can be placed on it only if it has its Blue side facing up. Furthermore, with the \"n\" = 2 puzzle the disks have their red side facing upwards in the starting position, whereas here they have their blue sides facing upwards. Thus, this intermediate configuration is not equivalent to the \"n\" = 2 MToH. Instead, we proceed as follows:\n\nThus, the solution requires 11 steps altogether. As just shown, it is natural to try and use the \"n\" = 2 solution to solve parts of the \"n\" = 3 puzzle in a recursive manner, as typically used for solving the classical ToH puzzle. However, in contrast to the classical ToH, here the \"n\" = 2 solution cannot be blindly applied due to the coloring of the posts and disks. This point illustrates that to achieve a more general solution for the \"n\" disk MToH puzzle, it is necessary to consider variants of the puzzle where the posts are pre-colored (either Blue or Red). By considering these variants it is possible to develop full recursive relations for the MToH puzzle, and thus find a general solution.\n\nThe above description of the MToH puzzle assumes that while the disks themselves are colored, the posts are neutral. This means that an empty post may accept a disk with either its Red side or Blue side facing up. This basic version of the MToH is called the \"free\" MToH.\n\nOther variations of the MToH puzzle are possible whereby the posts themselves are colored, as shown in the accompanying figure. If a post is pre-colored Red/Blue, then only disks with their Red/Blue side facing upwards may be placed on this pre-colored post. The different variations of the MToH may be named using a 3 letter label \"SID\", where S,I D refer to the color of the Source, Intermediate and Destination posts respectively, and may assume the values R (Red), B (Blue), or N (Neutral - no color). Thus, the \"NNN\" puzzle refers to the free MToH, while the \"RBB\" puzzle refers to the variation where the S post is pre-colored Red, while the I and D posts are pre-colored Blue.\n\nWhile the variations of the MToH are puzzles within their own right, they also play a key role in solving the free MToH. As seen above, intermediate states of the free MToH can be considered as colored variations, since a post with a disk already on it assume the corresponding color of the disk (meaning that only disk with the same color facing upwards can be placed on the post).\n\nFor example, in the free \"n\" = 3 MToH puzzle described above, after 5 moves an intermediate state is reached where the large disk is on the D post. From this point on, the D post is considered to be colored Blue, and the puzzle becomes equivalent to the \"NNB\" puzzle. If a solution is known for the \"n\" = 2 \"NNB\" puzzle, it could immediately be applied to complete the \"n\" = 3 free puzzle.\n\nNot all of the different colored variations are distinct puzzles, since symmetry means that some pre-colored puzzle variations are identical to others. For example, if we solve the RBB puzzle backwards, then this is the same as solving the RRB puzzle in the regular forward direction (note: the Blue and Red colors have been swapped to keep the rule that at the start of the puzzle all disks must be on the source post with their Red side facing up). Thus, the RBB and RRB puzzles form a time reversal symmetry pair. This means that they share the same characteristics with respect to the number of optimal moves required, even though each puzzle requires a distinct algorithm to solve it. In fact, it will be shown below that puzzles forming a time reversal symmetry pair are interdependent one on the other, in the sense that the solving algorithm of one makes use of the solving algorithm of the other.\n\nAs with the classical ToH puzzle, one of the simplest and most instructive methods for solving the MToH is to use recursive algorithms. Such algorithms are presented below for selected variations of the puzzle, and the optimality of the solutions is proved. Using these algorithms recursive relations, and subsequently closed form expressions, can be derived for the number of total moves required to solve the puzzle, and the number of moves each disk makes during the solution.\n\nThe recursive relations can also be presented and analyzed using a Markov type analysis, which is also discussed.\n\nIt is instructive to first consider the time reversal symmetry pair of puzzles RBB and RRB. As it turns out, these two puzzles are the simplest to solve in that their recursive algorithms depend only one on the other, and not on other variations of the puzzle.\n\nIn contrast, solutions for the semi-colored variations (where one or more posts are neutral) and the fully free variation are solved by more complex recursion relations.\nThe RBB(n) and RRB(n) puzzles can be solved using the following pair of optimal algorithms:\n\nFor RBB(n):\n\nFor RRB(n):\n\nThe optimality of this pair of algorithms is proved via induction, as follows (this proof also forms a detailed explanation of the algorithms):\n\nFor \"n\" = 1 it is obvious that the algorithms are optimal, since there is only a single move. Next, it is assumed that the algorithms are optimal for \"n\" − 1, and using this assumption, it is shown that they are optimal for \"n\".\n\nBeginning with the RBB(\"n\") algorithm, it is clear that before disk 1 can be placed on the D post, it must first be on the S post (which is the only post colored Red), and the rest of the disks must be on the I post. Thus, the solution must pass through this intermediate state, and, by assumption, the optimal way to achieve this intermediate state is to use the RBB(\"n\" − 1) algorithm with the D and I posts interchanged.\n\nNext, disk 1 has to be moved from S to D, since it must be moved at least once.\n\nNext, it is shown that from this state the final solution can only be reached via an intermediate state where all \"n\" − 1 disks are on the S post. For disk 2 to be placed on the D post, it must first be on the S post (the only Red post), while the other \"n\" − 2 disks must be on the I post. However, before disk 3 can be placed on the I post, it must first be on the S post on top of disk 2. This reasoning can proceed through all the disks, each of which must first be on the S post before passing to the I post, thus showing that the solution must pass through an intermediate state where all \"n\" − 1 disk are on the S post.\n\nTo achieve this intermediate state, it is necessary to use an optimal algorithm which transfers \"n\" − 1 disks from the Blue I post to the Red S post via the Blue D post, i.e. the optimal BBR(\"n\" − 1) algorithm, which is equivalent to the RRB(\"n\" − 1) algorithm (the colors are just swapped).\n\nFinally, it is necessary to transfer the \"n\" − 1 smallest disks from the S to the D post via the I post. This of course is just the RBB(\"n\" − 1) algorithm.\n\nSimilar reasoning can be applied to show that the RRB(n) algorithm above is optimal. \nSolving algorithms can also be written, and their optimality proved, for other time-reversal pairs of the puzzles, namely:\n\nThese algorithms are generally more complex, and make use of the fully colored RBB and RRB algorithms described above. Full details of these algorithms and proofs of their optimality can be found in.\n\nTo conclude this section, the solving algorithm of the fully free NNN puzzle is listed. The proof of optimality can also be found in.\n\n\nOnce the solving algorithms are found, they can be used to derive recurrence relations for the total number of moves made during the execution of the algorithm, as well as for the number of moves made by each disk.\n\nDenoting the total number of moves made by the optimal algorithms of the RBB and RRB puzzles as formula_1 and formula_2, then referring to the solving algorithm listed above, it is easy to show that the following recurrence relation holds:\n\nwhere use has been made of the fact that the RBB and RRB puzzles form a time reversal symmetry pair, and thus formula_4.\n\nIt is also possible to list a recursion relation for the total number of moves made by disk k, which we denote by formula_5 and formula_6 for the RBB and RRB algorithms respectively (note that formula_7 is independent of the total number of disks \"n\" in the puzzle).

In fact, as shown in, all variations of the MToH puzzle satisfy the asymptotic relations\n\nwith the factors \"s\", \"p\" given by the following table:\n\nFinally, while the integer sequences generated by the expression for formula_2 and formula_6 are well known and listed in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the integer sequences generated by the other puzzle variations are far less trivial, and were not found in OEIS prior to the analysis of the MToH. These new sequences, 15 in number, are now all listed.\n\nA powerful method of analyzing the MToH puzzle (and other similar puzzles), suggested by Fred Lunnon and presented in his review of Tower puzzles variations, is a matrix method.\n\nIn this method no effort is made to separate the various puzzles into independent groups whose solving algorithms depend only one on the other. Instead the solving algorithms are written in the most direct way so that algorithms of all the puzzle variations are interdependent. Once this has been done, the total number of moves formula_18 (S,I,D being equal to R,B,N) for each puzzle variation can be written as follows:\n\nNote that in contrast to the other variations and the general rule, MToH variations NNR and NBR end with the red sides of the disks facing upwards.

Prior to the addition of corn to the mixture, the main ingredients of broa were rye and malt. After corn was introduced in Europe from the Americas, \"broa\" became widely associated with \"corn-bread\". \nApart from the similarity of the Portuguese and German words \"Broa\" and \"Brot\", there is a strong resemblance between this very traditional Northern Portuguese bread and the German \"Roggenbrot\" (rye bread).\nSome suggest the name 'Broa' could derive instead from the Celtic word *broga- 'limit, field'.\n\nIt is a dark brown, very dense bread with a distinctive and intense flavour, bittersweet, made with corn and rye flours. It has a particularly slow manufacturing process: it is baked for about five to six hours in the oven. Once cooked, it is sprinkled with flour. The bread generally has the shape of a bell tower.\n\nNowadays, the bread of Avintes is also produced outside its original parish with industrial source materials The old mills of Avintes no longer have economic relevance. However, for the sake of tradition, the people of Avintes have maintained its crafty production, which is well appreciated by consumers who increasingly seek genuinely traditional products.\n\nConnected to its production are many so-called \"secrets\" which, real or not, lay in the certitudes and knowledge gained from experience of many generations of Avintes' bakers as well as the judicious choice of materials used. There are, also, some superstitions related to its mixing and baking, involving prayers and blessings, as indeed in the rest of Portugal when making bread in the old fashioned ways.\n\nThe \"brôa\" can also be served fried - for example, during Christmas as part of typical dishes in some of the northerners'homes. It is also used as the basis for multiple meal starters, as, for example \"Avintes brôa with coriander\". It is also appreciated with ham (preferably, also produced by hand) and with traditional Portuguese \"caldo-verde\" or \"green broth\" .\n\nEvery year, since 1988, the village of Avintes hosts the festivities celebrating their \"brôa\" bread during the last week of August.\n\n"}
{"id": "38419860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38419860", "title": "Turkish dialects", "text": "Turkish dialects\n\nThere is considerable dialectal variation in Turkish.\n\nTurkish is a southern Oghuz dialect of the Turkic languages, is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey, Bulgaria, the island of Cyprus, Greece (primarily in Western Thrace), Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Meskhetia, Romania, Iraq, Syria and other areas of traditional settlement which formerly, in whole or part, belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Turkish is the official language of Turkey and is one of the official languages of Cyprus. It also has official (but not primary) status in the Prizren District of Kosovo and several municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia, depending on the concentration of Turkish-speaking local population. Modern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul. Nonetheless, dialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s. The terms \"ağız\" or \"şive\" are often used to refer to the different types of Turkish dialects (such as Cypriot Turkish). In many cases, Azerbaijani may also be considered a dialect of Turkish.\n\nThe Turkish language was introduced to the Balkans by the Ottoman Turks during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Today, Turkish is still spoken by the Turkish minorities who are still living in the region, especially in Bulgaria, Greece (mainly in Western Thrace), Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, and Romania. Balkans Ottoman Turkish dialects were first described at the beginning of the 20th century, and are called \"Rumelian\"—a term introduced by Gyula Németh in 1956. Németh also established the basic division between Eastern Rumelian and Western Rumelian group of dialects. The bundle of isoglosses separating the two groups roughly follows the Bulgarian yat border. The eight basic Western Rumelian Turkish features are:\nAdditional features have been suggested such as the fronting of /k/ and /g/ to palatal affricates or stops, and the loss of /h/, especially in a word-initial position.\n\nRumelian Turkish dialects are the source of Turkish loanwords in Balkan languages, not the modern standard Turkish language which is based on the Istanbul dialect. For example, Serbo-Croatian kàpija/капија \"large gate\" comes from Rumelian \"kapi\", not standard Turkish \"kapı\".\n\nThe Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language of the administration. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences from the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots' knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together. The linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, when the island was divided into a Greek south and a Turkish north (Northern Cyprus). Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions.\n\nThe Meskhetian Turks speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, which hails from the regions of Kars, Ardahan, Iğdır and Artvin. The Meskhetian Turkish dialect has also borrowed from other languages (including Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian, and Uzbek) which the Meskhetian Turks have been in contact with during the Russian and Soviet rule.\n\nThe Syrian Turkmen, which are the descendants of Oghuz tribes, which migrated from Central Asia in the 11th century speak an archaic dialect of the Turkish language. The number of Turkmens in Syria is estimated to be up to 3,000,000, mostly in the Turkmen Mountain region and in the Shahba plain north of Aleppo, but also in Homs and Quneitra Governorate. Under the rule of the Ba'ath party in Syria, the Turkmens suffered under a heavy assimilation policy and were forbidden to write or publish in Turkish.\n\nDue to a large Turkish diaspora, significant Turkish-speaking communities also reside in countries such as Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, because of cultural assimilation of Turkish immigrants and their descendants in host countries, not all ethnic Turks speak the Turkish language with native fluency.\n\nThere are three major Anatolian Turkish dialect groups spoken in Turkey: the West Anatolian dialect (roughly to the west of the Euphrates), the East Anatolian dialect (to the east of the Euphrates), and the North East Anatolian group, which comprises the dialects of the Eastern Black Sea coast, such as Trabzon, Rize, and the littoral districts of Artvin.\n\nThe classification of the Anatolian dialects of the Turkish language:\n\n1.

It is an important concept in Advaita Vedanta pursuit of moksha and refers to the ability to achieve \"dispassion\", and \"discontinuation of religious ceremonies\".\n\nAccording to Adi Shankara Uparati or Uparama is the strict observance of one’s own Dharma. \"Sama\" is the restraining of the outgoing mental propensities i.e. the curbing of the mind from all objects other than hearing etc., and \"Dama\" is the restraining of the external sense-organs from all objects other than that. Uparati is \"Pratyahara\", the withdrawing of the Self (Vedantasara Slokas 18-20). These essentials along with \"Titiksha\" i.e. endurance of pairs of opposites, \"Samadhana\" i.e. constant concentration of the mind, Śraddhā i.e. faith in the truths of Vedanta, and \"Mumukshutva\" i.e. yearning for spiritual freedom, which are the six-fold inner-wealth prepare one eager for liberation to gain the knowledge of Brahman. Effort is involved in inculcating Sama and Dama but the exercise of Uparati requires no efforts. In the state of Uparati, which is total renunciation of actions i.e. enjoined duties, one discovers an inner poise, silence or joy. The mind which is conditioned to fulfil duties is not free to pursue knowledge. It is through renunciation that a few seekers have attained immortality – not through rituals, progeny or wealth – \"na karmana na prajya dhanena tyagenaike amrtatvamamasuh\" – \"Kaivalya Upanishad\", 3. Immortality is the state when becoming and being are one.\n\nWhereas the fruit of Vairagya is \"Bodha\" i.e. spiritual wisdom, the fruit of \"Bodha\" is \"Uparati\". The best Uparati (self-withdrawal) is that condition of the thought waves in which they are free from influences of external objects (Vivekachudamani Slokas 23). Uparati is the abstaining on principle from engaging in any acts and ceremonies enjoined by the Shastras; otherwise, it is the state of the mind which is always engaged in \"Sravana\" and the rest, without ever diverging from them.\n"}

The most common method produces \"milcaos colados\", strained milcaos, sometimes pronounced as the rhyming \"milcaos colaos\" with a silent “d”, as is common in Chilean Spanish. Here, the grated potatoes are strained to extract most of the water by folding in a dish cloth or pressing in a sieve or against a hard surface. \n\nAlternatively, the grated potato can be folded directly into the mash, to produce \"milcaos rallados\" (“grated milcaos”).\n\nIn the straining method, the juice from the strained potatoes is saved and decanted to produce , a kind of potato starch.

The term came into common use in the 1980s and is used to describe both the typical barbecuing technique and the nature of the event itself. The primary element of a sausage sizzle is the preparation and sale of barbecued sausages, typically with some form of bread and often accompanied by sauces or other barbecued items such as sliced onion.\n\nMost commonly, the main sale item at a sausage sizzle is a cheap pork or beef sausage (known in Australia as a \"snag\"), cooked on a gas hot plate and served on a single slice of white bread or in Western Australia a hotdog roll. Tomato Sauce is the most common accompaniment, and is usually available for no extra cost, though other condiments such as barbecue sauce and American mustard are regularly available. Onions cooked on the hot plate are often available, for free or at extra cost, and occasionally coleslaw or other salad items are offered. Some sausage sizzles also offer the option of a white bread roll as an alternative to sliced bread. Vegetarian or gluten free options are infrequently available, but often sold at events with more extensive menus including hamburgers or complete meals. Soft drink cans or bottled water may also be available for purchase, so as to maximise fundraising.\n\nSausage sizzles are generally held either as free community events or as fundraisers for charities, schools, sports clubs and other organisations.

This variety of Moa originated in Jaynagar city of South 24 Parganas district in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is now a popular sweet, being produced in Kolkata and elsewhere, sometimes with cheaper ingredients and chemical flavours. Jaynagarer Moa was given a Geographical Indication tag in 2015 which will enable the product to be protected from unauthorized uses and piracy.\n\nJaynagarer Moa is made with \"Nolen Gur\" (jaggery made from date palm tree extract with exquisite taste and aroma), Kanakchur khoi (a form of popped rice made from a special variety of aromatic rice), \"Gawa ghee\" (a type of clarified butter made from cow's milk), \"elach\" (cardamom), and \"posto\" (poppy seed). Both \"Nolen Gur\" and Kanakchur rice are winter products (available around November to January) and hence Jaynagarer Moa is available during this period only. The ordinary or common Moa is a small crispy ball made of puffed rice (\"Muri\" rather than \"Khoi\") and jaggery. It is produced in homes all over Bengal and is also generally available in grocery shops in small plastic packets, throughout the year.\n\nThere are over 250 sweetmeat shops around Jaynagar city, which produce Jaynagarer Moa with the original ingredients. The Jaynagarer Moa manufacturers in Jaynagar city had been attempting to get Geographical Indication status for Jaynagarer Moa.\n\nThe popularity of the dish has led in recent years to sweetmeat makers all over West Bengal, particularly Kolkata, producing large quantities of Jaynagarer Moa using cheaper ingredients flavoured with chemical aromatics and marketing them as Jaynagarer Moa. \n\nDate palm jaggery is becoming harder to come by due to the decrease in the number of date palms in West Bengal and the shift of members of the Shiuli community, traditional producers of \"Nolen Gur\" from date palm juice, to other professions. Similarly, Kanakchur rice is a local variant which grows only in winter and through traditional fertiliser-free techniques only.\n"}

Each piece is stuffed with onions, parsley, garlic, and salt pork before being rolled and wrapped into a small pouch or package. The stuffed offal is then stewed for several hours in a white wine and tomato sauce.\n\nThe feet and stuffed offal can also be cooked without tomato sauce, in which case it is eaten with a vinaigrette and known as \"tripo à la reboulado\".\n\n"}

{"id": "38675838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38675838", "title": "Bark bread", "text": "Bark bread\n\nBark bread is a traditional food made with cambium (phloem) flour.\n\nBark bread seems to be a primarily Scandinavian tradition. Mention of it is found in medieval literature and may have an even older tradition among the Sami people.\n\nDuring the 18th and early 19th century Northern Europe experienced several very bad years of crop failure, particularly during the Little Ice Age of the mid-18th century. The grain harvest was badly affected, and creative solutions to make the flour last longer were introduced. In 1742, samples of \"emergency bread\" were sent from Kristiansand, Norway, to the Royal Administration in Copenhagen, among them bark bread, bread made from grainless husks and bread made from burned bones. During the Napoleonic Wars, moss too was used for human consumption.\n\nThe last time bark bread was used as famine food in Norway was during the Napoleonic Wars. The introduction of the potato as a staple crop gave the farmers alternative crops when grain production failed, so that bark bread and moss cakes were no longer needed. In Northern Sweden, traces of Sami harvest of bark from Scots pine are known from the 1890s, and in Finland \"pettuleipä\" (literally \"pinewood-bark bread\") was produced as ersatz bread during the Finnish Civil War of 1918.\n\nFinger sized twigs and branches were collected from deciduous trees and shrubs, and the bark split and the inner bark (the phloem and sometimes the vascular cambium) collected while still fresh. The yellow or green inner bark (depending on tree species) was dried over open fire, in an oven or dried in the sun for a few days. A mortar or mill was used to grind the bark to a fine powder to add to the flour. The dried bark pieces could also be added directly to the grain during milling. The bread was then baked the normal way adding yeast and salt.\n\nBark bread did not leaven as quickly as normal bread due to bark content. The more bark to flour, the slower the leavening. Bark bread was therefore often made as a flatbread. The bark flour could also be used for porridge.\n\nThe bark component was usually from deciduous trees like elm, ash, aspen, rowan or birch, but scots pine and Iceland moss (sometimes named \"bread moss\" in Norwegian) are mentioned in historic sources. The inner bark is the only part of a tree trunk that is actually edible, the remaining bark and wood is made up of cellulose which animals, including humans, cannot digest. The dried and ground inner bark was added in proportions like 1/4th to 1/3rd \"bark flour\" to the remaining grain flour. Erik Pontoppidan, the Bishop of Bergen, Norway, in the mid 18th century, recommended using elm, as it helped the often crumbly bark bread hold together better.\n\nThe bark will, however, add a rather bitter taste to the bread, and give particularly white bread an unappetizing grey-green hue. Another problem is that the yeast cannot break down the ground bark and the bread will not leaven properly and be hard and not hold together well. Though bark today is sometimes added to pastry as a culinary curiosity, bark bread was considered an emergency food, and as is common with such food, phased out as soon as the availability of grain improved.\n\nThe bark bread was seen as nutritionally deficient, more as \"stomach filler\" than as actual sustenance. Both the bishop Pontoppidan and others blamed the high mortality during the famine of the 1740s on the \"unhealthy bark bread\" and general lack of food. Among the Sami however, the bark and bark bread made from Scots pine served as an important source of vitamin C.\n"}

The dish is typically prepared with biscuits or crackers, cocoa, butter, sugar and solidified milk.\n\nIn 1888, production of chocolate and other products arrived to Kaunas, situated in the south-centre of Lithuania. Due to this, artisans started to elaborate upon new recipes with chocolate, such as chocolate and biscuits and chocolate with raisins or hazelnuts. In Lithuania different types of hazelnuts are available because there are a great variety of forests, so they are used frequently.\n\nLithuanians also began to make cognac sweetened with chocolate and created new liquors that utilized chocolate. More elaborate recipes were created, such as the sweet called \"tinginys,\" which means \"lazy\".\n\nIn 1967 a woman accidentally created the recipe; she tried to cook chocolate but added too much sugar, which liquefied the mixture into a syrup. To remedy this, the woman tried to make the savour less strong by adding some biscuits, so she broke them into pieces, mixed them with the syrup and when it cooled, the first Tinginys was created. Later modifications occurred, such as letting the mixture cool down and rolling it on a plastic bag, and then cutting it into pieces. People decided to call it \"lazy\" because it was very easy and quick to prepare.\n\nToday, tinginys is sometimes produced using less expensive ingredients and with even easier methods. Cocoa is sometimes used in place of chocolate, and condensed milk is sometimes used in place of boiled, solidified milk.\n\n"}
{"id": "38697245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38697245", "title": "Cosmine", "text": "Cosmine\n\nCosmine is a spongy, bony material that makes up the dentine-like layers in the scales of the lobe-finned fishes of the class Sarcopterygii. Fish scales that include layers of cosmine are known as cosmoid scales.\n\nAs traditionally described, cosmine consists of a layer of dentine covered by a continuous sheet of enamel. Pulp cavities, which secrete dentine tubules, are surrounded by a complex polygonal network of 'pore cavities' which pierce the overlying enamel layer, giving cosmine its characteristic dotted appearance. The pulp cavities and pore chambers are connected by a complex, reticulated pore canal network which continues into a layer of vascular bone beneath the dentine. The exact configuration of the pore canal network and shape of the pore chambers differs between various taxa, although the general organization into a single layer of enamel over dentine with pore canals with vascular bone underneath remains consistent, at least within the Sarcopterygii.\n\nCosmine was first described in the Osteolepiform \"Megalichthys hibberti\" by Williamson in 1849, in a purely descriptive, pre-Darwinian, non-evolutionary framework. Goodrich expanded on Williamson's descriptions, hypothesizing a transition from a monoodontode scale (like a chondryicthian placoid scale) to a complex polyodontode scale through fusion of discrete units. Gross' 1956 monograph provided the most elaborate description of cosmoid tissues detailing differences between the shape and configuration of pore canals within different clades of lobe finned fishes. Further descriptions of cosmine growth and development were advanced by Tor Ørvig, dealing specifically with the pattern of squamation, or scale formation across the body of a fish. Ørvig rationalized the observed patterns of cosmine in the fossil record with putative losses of the tissue in coelacanths and extant lungfish proposing that coelacanths, for example, retained a juvenile scale morphology through pedomorphosis. Keith Thomson later analyzed specific growth structures on the cosmine sheet- 'blisters' or 'islands' where cosmine had broken down, and deduced an electroceptive function for the pore chambers. Comparisons with electroceptive organs in extant sarcopterygians, however, have contradicted Thomson's functional hypothesis.\n\nNew fossils from China have altered current understanding of early fish evolution. Many of these fossils have been identified on the basis of histological characteristics, such as \"Meemannia eos,\" classified as an early diverging sarcopterygian on the basis of a pore canal system similar to cosmine. However, later studies on cranial characters have indicated that \"Meemannia\" is likely a basal actinopterygian. Newer imaging studies including synchrotron tomography show that pore canal systems in association with dentine occur outside the crown sarcopterygian clade, implying an older synapomorphy of Osteichthyes as opposed to a definitive sarcopterygian trait. The exact phylogenetic significance of cosmine (as classically described) remains unclear.\n\n\n"}

Several types of meats are used to prepare barbecue sandwiches. Some varieties use cooked meats that are not barbecued, but include barbecue sauce. Many variations, including regional variations, exist, along with diverse types of cooking styles, preparations and ingredients.\n\nA plethora of meats and preparation styles for barbecue sandwiches exist. Meats may be sliced, chopped or pulled, and various types are used, such as pork, pulled pork, pork shoulder, beef, beef brisket, chicken, sausage, pork ribs and turkey. Some versions use slow-smoked meats. Barbecue sandwiches typically have barbecue sauce included in their preparation, either when the meat is cooked, as a sauce within a sandwich, or both. Some meats may be seasoned with a spice rub. Some barbecue sandwiches may use cooked meats that are not barbecued, but include a barbecue sauce. Coleslaw is sometimes served with barbecue sandwiches, either on the sandwich itself or as a side dish. Sometimes sautéed vegetables such as onion and garlic are also used. Some versions prepared with beef brisket include both lean and fatty portions from the cut of beef to enhance their flavor. Pre-packaged barbecue sandwiches are also manufactured.\n\nBreads used in the preparation of barbecue sandwiches include white bread, hamburger buns, whole wheat bread and even rye bread. The bread can help to prevent the meat from drying and to retain its temperature.\n\nIn East Asian cuisine, bánh mì sandwiches may contain Korean barbecue and Thai barbecued chicken, as well as other types of meats such as marinated beef and roast pork.\n\nIn downstate Illinois and northeastern Pennsylvania, a barbecue sandwich generally refers to ground beef cooked in barbecue sauce, served on a hamburger bun, known in other parts of the country as a Sloppy Joe.\n\nIn northeastern Pennsylvania, the sandwich is often served at pizza places.\n\nIn Kansas City, Missouri, beef brisket barbecue sandwiches are common, and are served with sauce atop them or dry.\n\nChopped pork barbecue sandwiches with coleslaw served on the sandwich are common in North Carolina. The term \"barbecue\" in North Carolina commonly refers specifically to barbecued, chopped pork, whereas other barbecued foods are often referred to by their actual food name.\n\nChopped pork shoulder barbecue sandwiches served with coleslaw atop them are common in Memphis, Tennessee. For example, Leonard Heuberger, who in 1922 founded a barbecue restaurant in Memphis named Leonard's, has been reputed there as being the inventor of the \"classic Memphis pork barbecue sandwich\". This sandwich was prepared on a bun with chopped or pulled pork shoulder meat, a tomato-based sauce, and coleslaw. In the book \"Southern Food: At Home, on the Road, in History\", it is stated that other restaurants \"followed suit\" regarding this sandwich style, and that \"...the standard has not changed in more than 60 years.\" At the Memphis restaurant chain Tops, pork shoulder sandwiches are described in this book as a \"mainstay\" that have existed as such since 1952, when the first Tops restaurant opened.\n\nBarbecue in East Texas is often chopped beef or pork and is typically served on a bun. Griffin Smith, Jr. of the magazine \"Texas Monthly\" described East Texas barbecue as \"...basically a sandwich product heavy on hot sauce.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38998735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38998735", "title": "Qanun (law)", "text": "Qanun (law)\n\nQanun is an Arabic word (, \"qānūn\"; , \"kānūn\", derived from \"kanōn\", which is also the root for the modern English word \"canon\"). It can refer to laws established by Muslim sovereigns, in particular the body of administrative, economic and criminal law promulgated by Ottoman sultans, in contrast to sharia, the body of law elaborated by Muslim jurists. It is thus frequently translated as \"dynastic law\". The idea of \"kanun\" first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the Mongol Empire in the aftermath of their invasions. The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleiman was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni (\"the Lawgiver\"), due to his code of laws. \n\nAfter the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258, a practice known to the Turks and Mongols transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to caliphs, governors, and sultans alike to \"make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia.\" This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE). Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.\n\nThe term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan Selim I (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of Abu ʾl-Suʿūd, grand muftī of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.\n\n"}
{"id": "39010596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39010596", "title": "Faltah", "text": "Faltah\n\nFaltah Arabic فلتة was the word used by Umar for the process of appointment of Abu Bakr at Saqifah. Refer the excerpts from a sermon delivered by Umar in the last year of his caliphate when he learned that people wanted to appoint an Imam for themselves:\n\n\" . . . let me clarify this to you that the allegiance with Abu Bakr was a faltah but Allah saved us from its evil. Therefore, whoever (intends to) acts like this you must kill him. . .\"\n\nThe point of importance to us from this hadith is the exact meaning of the word Faltah in its usage and what the various scholars have said about the terminological meaning of this word.\n\nReferences from the books of Lugat with respect to the word Faltah are as follows:\n1)الأمر إذا لم يكن عن تدبر ولا رأي ولا تردد - An affair that has occurred without thinking and without opinion and without pondering \n\n2) كان هذا الأمر فلتة إذا كان فجأة لم يتقدمه تدبر له ولا ثشاور فيه - An affair is termed faltah if it occurs suddenly to which there is no prior reflection nor any consultation for it.\n\n3) كل أمر فعل على غير تمكث فقد افلت - every thing that is done without dwelling in it leads to faltah.\n\n4) last night after which the haram month starts i.e. the month in which fighting, killing, slaying, revenging etc. was considered haram. As a result, this night was observed very dangerous and bloody as after this no revenge would be possible until the prohibited month finished and hence there was a lot of mischief in this night and its termed as faltah.\n\n5) الأمر يقع من غير إحكام - an act that happened in contradiction to its order.\n\n6) معناه ما يندم عليه - Faltah is synonymous to what is regretted upon.\n\nFrom the above references we can conclude that the usage of Faltha can be categorized in three different groups\n\n1) Sudden event\n\n2) Sudden Appearance\n\n3) Fault\n\nThe third category appears more appropriate in the case of this hadith as the proceeding statement of Umar indicates towards Faltah being a mistake i.e. \"Allah saved us from its evil\". If it was not a fault then there was no sense in Umar considering any chances of \"evil\" results. It is very important for the people to understand the real meaning of this word as it has a direct connection with appointment of Abu Bakr in Saqifah, and to a great extent this hadith of Faltah also contributes in falsification of the process of appointment of Abu Bakr in the eyes of Umar. Thus we conclude the article with the following inferences:\n\n1) There was no precedence or nomination for the process of appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph rather process of his appointment was faltah.\n\n2) Although Umar admits that Allah saved the ummah from its evil, but there is no clear indication or measure as to how the ummah was saved from its evil.\n\n3) It is evident in history that the appointment of Abu Bakr was a turning point in Islam that caused a great evil and split the Muslim ummah into two main fractions VIZ Sunnis and the Shias.\n\n"}

It consists of bite-sized pieces of chicken, coated and fried with flour and seasoning mixture. Salt and pepper is the staple condiment, while chili powder and lightly fried basil leaves are added to preference. Since the creation of this dish, it has become a popular fast food in other countries in Asia as well as among Asian immigrant populations overseas.\n\nTaiwanese fried chicken is famous in its diverse forms and texture, breaks through the confine of the other snacks, having a high status in the street food industry. It then rapidly becomes prevalent in the street and night markets.\n\nDespite the fact that the history of fried chicken is not long, it evolves a lot to overcome the competitiveness and so more choices and preferences have been released. In the early stage, the fried chicken is merely added with chili powder to separate into mild, medium spicy and extra spicy three flavors. It varies with the time and uses more other seasonings, such as allspice, seaweed powder, mustard powder etc. for flavoring or pickles it with honey or filling cheese inside.\n\nApart from using a pot of oil, it uses two pots of oil with high and low temperatures to fry the chickens in order to optimise the texture and taste nowadays. It uses the oil with high temperature to fry the chicken to lock its gravy, followed by the oil with low temperature to make it cooked. Using this method can eliminate the shortcoming of using just a pot of oil, which are either not fully cooked or overcooked leading to losing of the gravy and dry texture. Since frying the chickens with a pot of oil always result of a thick layer of fried flour and thin layer of meat, using the new method can avoid this from happening.\n\nBesides, some sellers use the subcutaneous fat of chickens as oil to fry the chicken, it can make the fried chickens smell good and less greasy. However, the cost of it is high. Therefore, only a few of people will use this method. The famous news recently about the Taiwanese Fried Chicken are Henry Cheng Kar-Shun and the Professor Sung Selling Fried Chicken. It is unpredictable and interesting that they can be well-known because of the fried chicken.\n\nHong Kong and Taiwan have close ties and people travel a lot between the two places, hence the products have long been well-known among Hong Kong people. This loyalty means that Hong Kong is a big market for Taiwanese food. It is curial to bring to Hong Kong customers the genuine Taiwanese fried chicken, with its high quality of ingredients and services. There are some famous brand selling Taiwanese food in Hong Kong, such as the Hot Star Large Fried Chicken and Ji Guang.[3] In 2016, the Hot Star Lage Fried Chicken has the largest market share of this industry that it has 15 branches. [4]\n\nIn general, only diced chicken leg or thigh meat is used and is marinated in soy sauce, sugar, garlic spread, rice wine, five-spice powder and spices powder for at least an hour. After marinating, chicken is dipped in beaten egg and then dredged in flour or sweet potato starch. Oil needs to be heated to 180 degrees (C) and when the oil is hot, the chicken can be added. It is fried until the surface color turns soft yellow and then it is ready to serve. Traditionally, after the chicken is fried, more pepper is added before eating.\n\nTaiwanese fried chicken is a high fat, salty dish. During the cooking process the chicken is deep fried in the oil. Cooking oil tends to break down during the frying process—a chemical transformation that changes the oil’s fatty acid composition, explains study co-author Leah Cahill, a research fellow in nutritional sciences at the Harvard School of Public Health. And this will cause long-term illness, including heart disease, high blood pressure, etc.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39038380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39038380", "title": "Phat Beets Produce", "text": "Phat Beets Produce\n\nPhat Beets Produce is an American food justice collective focusing on food justice in North Oakland, California, started by Max Cadji and Bret Brenner in 2007. Their programs include weekly farmer's markets (sourcing from local farmers of color), free produce stands, youth gardens, community supported agriculture programs (called the \"beet box\"), food and social justice workshops, and previously, a kitchen and cafe cooperative. Cadji helps residents have access to nutritious food by coordinating between farmers, institutions, and low-income communities to utilize empty land for urban gardening.\n\nTheir mission addresses disadvantaged North Oakland residents, actively opposes the systematic forces of gentrification in the North Oakland Area, and stands in solidarity with criminal justice issues. The organization states that it draws largely from the Black Panther Party, whose founding members lived in the North Oakland area. The Black Panthers focused on black empowerment and racial issues, but also addressed food justice issues, most notably their Free Breakfast for Children program.\n\nPhat Beets has four community produce spaces located around Oakland: North Oakland Children’s Hospital, Arlington Medical Center Farmer’s Market, Arlington Medical Center Produce Stand, and the Saint Martin De Porres Community Produce Stand. Three gardens grow their produce: Healthy Hearts Garden (Dover Street Garden), 59th street spiral gardens, and BEET DOWN! Acres.\n\nPhat Beets is a social justice organization that takes an open position on food justice and other social issues, like housing justice, gentrification, and racialized processes within the criminal justice system, to address a variety of issues that relate to each other in hopes of helping community members in need and taking an active role in attempting to solve social problems. The organization believes this approach follows the theory of Intersectionality, in that individuals experience multiple forms of oppression at the same time, which shapes their identity.\n\nFood and housing justice are connected because they share similar factors, like place-based city planning and policy, transportation regulations, and commercial real estate development that change and subsequently affect the environment of the food and housing justice movements. Phat Beets has also mentioned that racialized processes are in line with food justice because a minority community’s lack of access to nutritious and affordable food is partially a result of racist policies that prevented the accessibility to healthy food in low-income minority communities in the first place, like the investment into suburbs and capital structure after World War II that left minority groups in the city without access to grocery stores. Phat Beets has stated that gentrification is also in part caused by racialized policies that push minority groups farther away from their homes and healthy food.\n\nAccording to the Just Food organization located in New York City, “Food justice is communities exercising their right to grow, sell, and eat healthy food.” Phat Beets believes that everyone deserves the right to have healthy food that is affordable and easily accessible. In order to help strengthen food justice in Oakland, part of the Phat Beets mission is to create opportunities for local farmers and businesses, connect the community to food justice, and find different methods of making healthy food accessible\n\nPhat Beets believes it provides farmers of color in Oakland more opportunities to be profitable because the organization's mission is aimed at offering space for produce sales in farmer’s markets and produce stands at local schools and hospitals. The goal is to help local farmers have enough economic support that will allow them to stay in business and continue to sell their crops in the community. By striving to give local farmers more opportunities to succeed, Phat Beets hopes to lower the dependency residents have on cheap, processed food because there will be more options to buy local, nutritious food.\n\nPhat Beets also makes it a point to connect “community and individual health with our food system.” They also aim to connect the community to food justice by focusing on groups that need aid, like residents suffering from obesity, and teaching them how to make healthy lifestyle decisions. In order to have a strong food system, programs like “Fresh Fellows” teach youth at risk of chronic diseases how to have a healthy lifestyle regardless of the challenges they face. Lastly, part of the Phat Beets strategy is to form community organizing like workshops and farmers’ markets, with the goal of fostering a sense unity and strength so that the community can come together to fight the issues affecting them, like “those affected by diet related diseases within the North Oakland Flatlands.\"\n\nAnother way that they are also working to promote food justice and make healthy food more accessible is by creating new methods of allowing sustainable food to be in the economy. For example, Phat Beets has worked toward passing policies that would allow residents to utilize public parks for food cultivation, including collaboration with the Edible Parks Task Force to create gardens at public parks. Furthermore, Phat Beets previously connected with local entrepreneurs to help boost the local economy by participating in The Kitchen Incubator program to help give small restaurant businesses a stronger chance of being successful. This program is intended to help create a profitable economic environment for sustainable food.\n\nPhat Beets has decided to take an open stance against gentrification, “a shift in an urban community toward wealthier residents and/or businesses and increasing property values”, because they believe they should fight intersecting social issues in order to allow food justice to thrive. Gentrification pushes residents out of their communities and makes it more difficult for them to have access to healthy, affordable food. So in order to strengthen food justice, Phat Beets believes it must also help fight gentrification. Phat Beets has stated that gentrification is the result of “a politically deliberate program set in motion by real estate companies, developers, big business, government officials and police.” Phat Beets believes one way gentrification could be alleviated would be if the City of Oakland provided monetary support for the community.\n\nPhat Beets released a “Statement on Gentrification” to elaborate on their gentrification position. In summary it says that if someone agrees with Phat Beets’ mission, then they are ultimately against gentrification because it forces out residents and therefore prevents low-income minority groups from having access to healthy, affordable food. Phat Beets believes the City of Oakland contributes to the perpetuation of gentrification because it decreases monetary support for North Oakland residents, while it still “selectively funnels funds into better transportation and subsidizes high-end business and housing developments.” Phat Beets does not support documentaries made by the Better Homes and Real Estate Company that promote NOBE (an acronym that stands for North Oakland, Berkeley, and Emoryvile) that state “these neighborhoods are being ‘discovered’” because it is an attempt to make the neighborhood more attractive to richer residents and businesses. Phat Beets understands that new individuals moving into Oakland cannot be blamed for gentrification, but it is important to still understand the systems that are allowing for gentrification and other injustices to continue.\n\nUrban gardens are generally created to make a positive contribution to their communities. However, some arguments have been made that urban gardens promote gentrification because they are placing their needs above those of the underrepresented groups in their community. Urban gardens could be used as a “gentrification tool” because their attractiveness might allure higher end businesses and richer residents to move into the area. This would help raise the cost of living and subsequently force the people that the community garden was attempting help out. Phat Beets stood by their belief when a local business, Grease Box, moved into their former farmer's market location, sparking public claims of displacement and gentrification from the organization toward the owner.\n\nSome supporters of urban agriculture, like the San Francisco Urban Agriculture alliance oppose such arguments because they believe that there are larger social and economic forces at play that cause gentrification. Patrick Crouch, an urban farmer and author, also believes that gentrification is directly influenced by government’s economic incentives to bring in more affluent people, and is not caused by community development. There have been instances of some urban gardens, like Georgia Street in Detroit, that are thought to help the community but not contribute to gentrification because of their location. Georgia Street is located far from high traffic areas that would make it more alluring for businesses to open.\n\nIn order to better deal with the contribution of gentrification urban gardening may have, the San Franischo Urban Agriculture Alliance and Crouch's Urban Garden, like Phat Beets, have decided to incorporate social justice into their organizations framework in order to “make sure urban agriculture is more than just a catalyst for gentrification.” This would allow urban gardens to be a positive contribution to the community because they are keeping its issues and needs in mind. Patrick Crouch suggests that understanding the community’s history and policies, supporting community leaders, and paying attention to the people’s needs will allow an urban garden to help combat gentrification from occurring.\n\nOne of the biggest platforms that Phat Beets Produce works on is gentrification as it relates to food justice. In fact, Phat Beets is one of the first organizations in the country to connect issues of food justice with gentrification, creating a model for other organizations around the country. Maurice, one of the founders had this to say about making those connections“A lot of organizations that have a lot more push and power are really interested by what we’re saying and they contact us from around the country. We’re influencing the way they do their work. We’re also pushing other organizations to start talking about these issues. We get to be the bad guys, we get to get shit on. But at the same time everyone else in the movement and in other movement have to move along with our rhetoric.” According to Phat Beets, gentrification is defined as, “When long time residents in low-income communities due to the migration of new more affluent residents and the rising housing costs associated with developments and businesses that cater to them.” Phat Beets Produce believes that gentrification has a huge potential to undermine their food justice work because it is displacing the low income colored communities that they are trying to give access to healthy foods. Phat Beets Produce also fears that gentrification could price their own organization out of the neighborhood because the rent prices in North Oakland where they operate from continue to increase. Phat Beets also highlights that gentrification is a structural rather than individual process and do not intend to criminalize their new neighbors. Although, gentrification has the potential to also help the organization, because new more affluent residents are moving into the area and giving them financial support, Phat Beets continues to fight gentrification in any way they can. One way they do so is by challenging the structures that encourages the movement of new more affluent families, such as certain economic and investment models.\n\nIn 2011, the foreclosure rate in Oakland was 1 out of 241 homes foreclosed, making Oakland’s foreclosure rates, one of the highest in California. These foreclosure rates and gentrification drive longtime residents out of their homes, an issue Phat Beets Produce makes a huge effort to fight. Phat Beets states that “Gentrification is a dynamic that emerges in poor urban areas when renovation, restoration, and residential shifts drives people out of the neighborhood.” One of the tactics used by Phat Beets is to address this issue of gentrification in Oakland with local realtors such as Linette Edwards. Realtors like Linette promote areas like Oakland through the term NOBE (North Oakland, Berkeley, and Emeryville) as an up-and-coming community, with new restaurants, walkability, and easy access to San Francisco. However, these new businesses according to Phat Beets are only increasing the appeal of higher income migrants and decreasing accessibility of those same resources to the poor. While promoting the development of the community may be seemingly good, Phat Beets understands this as a threat to the longtime members of the community. For example, new businesses can afford increased commercial rent and can cater to a more affluent base of consumers, displacing old businesses, and decreasing accessibility to those who can’t afford these new businesses. This new revitalization of the area, with new bars and cafes, is not always seen as friendly to longtime residents as new high-income residents are actually pushing them out through foreclosure, according to Phat Beets. Even more problematic, to Phat Beets Produce, realtors like Linette are using their gardens and markets as well as other neighborhood gardens to flip homes and further gentrify the neighborhood.\n\nOne of the most recent challenges has been displacement by other organizations. The once abandoned North Oakland building was supposed to open a healthy foods cafe to provide access to fresh food options to a community who otherwise did not have access to it. Phat Beets had also just opened up a Kitchen Incubator program that allowed low income Oakland residents to open up their own food business at a low price. However, when a new tenant arrived in 2013, Grease Box (A gluten free restaurant) things became problematic for the program. What was supposed to be a harmonious relationship, with Phat Beets Produce’s farmers market operating in the parking lot turned out to be very problematic according to Phat Beets. Just months after Grease Box moved into the building Phat Beets accused the owner of displacing not only its own programs but also low income Oakland residents in the process of gentrification. In a statement describing the situation Phat Beets commented that Grease Box is “part of the ongoing process of gentrification where historic Oakland residents lose houses, jobs, and opportunities to newer, wealthier incoming residents with greater access to resources.” According to Phat Beets, for these reasons, GreaseBox has shut down the Kitchen Incubator Program and has forced them to move locations to the Arlington Health Center.\n\nAccording to Phat Beets Produce the problem is that Grease Box is not just a threat to them, but it is a threat to the community overall. Phat Beets Produce has complained that many of the vendors in the Kitchen Incubator program have not been able to use the kitchen because of Grease Box’s owner’s Lizzy’s demand for a gluten free kitchen and health permits only allowing Grease Box employees to use the kitchen. Other vendors such as the one owned by Naimah Matthews have been displaced and were forced to pack their stuff and leave once Grease Box moved in, even though they had been cooking and selling food out of the cafe before Grease Box had even arrived.http://www.eastbayexpress.com/WhatTheFork/archives/2013/08/27/grease-box-phat-beets-and-the-g-word Phat Beets thinks this is also problematic for the community because historic residents are now being forced to move because their housing costs and property values are rising with new residents and businesses like Grease Box moving in. This has caused Phat Beets to spend their time, money, and resources to fight displacement instead of focusing on their food justice programs.\n\nThe basic leadership structure of Phat Beets Produce is highly dependent on the work of volunteers. The main five programs that Phat Beets Produce has are the farmers’ markets, Healthy Hearts Youth Empowerment, Beet Box Urban Community Sustained Agriculture, Get Organized! and Community Celebrates!. Currently, the main source of leadership and organization is the volunteer collective that consists of 8–12 members. Each member has to meet certain requirements to fulfill membership, including a 1-year commitment, participation in 80% of monthly meetings, and volunteering 4 hours every month. They also use a working group based model where different working committees are responsible for creating and leading their own program. Currently there are five committees: the Farmer’s Market Committee, Garden Steering Committee, CSA committee, and the Fundraising Committee. The current main leaders of the collective are Max Cadji, Brett Benner, and Toveo Hill.\n\nA major component of urban agriculture is actually getting the produce to the local residents. Besides beet boxes, farmers markets are the main source of this exchange in the community. Phat Beet Produce has two farmers’ markets in clinics and two community produce stands. The 4 different farmers markets located in: North Arlingon Medical Center, North Oakland Children’s Hospital, Farm Free Stand – Arlington Medical Center, and Saint Martin De Porres Community Produce Stand. The produce that is sold at these farmers’ markets comes primarily from small farmers and farmers of color. At the farmers’ markets, there are also vendors that sell already cooked food. In terms of future expansion, Phat Beets Produce plans to open a new farmer's market on June 14 of 2014. The location of this new farmers' market will be near the Destiny Arts Center in North Oakland.\n\nWill Scott, the President of the African American Farmer’s of California is one of the many farms that participate in the farmers’ markets. Even though the Scott’s Family Farm is based in Fresno, Will Scott makes the trip to Oakland in order to increase presence of farmers of color in our nation. One commentator in “The Disappearing Farmer” stated that there is, “loss of land by our farmers, African American farmers, who are now less than 2% in the country, and have been losing about a half million acres of land a year in this country. And there were some indicators that for every acre lost, there was a reciprocal loss of economic wealth in our community.” African-American history of agriculture in the United States is an important driving force for present-day farmers of color. Furthermore, throughout history, there has been a correlation between land ownership and power.\n\nPhat Beets was first started by Max Cadjii and Brett Brenner in 2007 at the St. Martin de Porres School, located at the school parking lot on 675 41st Street in Oakland. OBUGS, a garden organization partnered with Phat Beets to create a garden and produce stand that would make healthy food more accessible to children and residents. This produce stand is still available to students, so instead of kids rushing to the ice cream truck, they have various fresh and healthy produce they can choose from. Every Wednesday from September to June, Phat Beets comes to the school and supplies the children with fresh produce. To help the children develop leadership roles, the children help set up, prepare the vegetables, handle transactions, and are a part of food demonstrations. This is effective in helping teach the youth more about food justice.\n\nThe Oakland’s Children Hospital Farmer’s Market was started by Max Cadji, Dr. Jennifer Matthews, and Brett Brenner in June 2010. Max Cadji wanted to open up a new produce market and was able to collaborate with Dr. Jennifer Mathews to create a produce stand in the Hospital. This idea met the goals of Phat Beets by increasing healthy food accessibility to residents and of Dr. Mathews because it directly supports the patients of the Healthy Hearts Clinic, a child obesity clinic. Dr. Mathews realized that it was important to create a produce stand when she witnessed how difficult it was for her Healthy Hearts patients to buy the fruits and vegetable she prescribed because they were too expensive or far away.\n\nThe Oakland’s Children Hospital farmer’s market aim is to offer an extensive variety of fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, and other treats as cheaply possible. To make the produce as affordable as possible they offer $5 food vouchers (“carrot cash”) and accept food stamps in order to help get people more interested in exploring healthy food. Its location is also convenient because patients have to walk through the farmer’s market as they leave the hospital. Furthermore, the farmer’s market is on the same day as the Healthy Hearts Clinic, a pediatric program dedicated to preventing and treating childhood diet-related illnesses, so that the patients are more likely to visit the produce stand. This farmer’s market and Dover garden now offer a Healthy Hearts Youth Garden in partnership with the Healthy Hearts Clinic.\n\nOn July 3, 2010, Phat beets opened a new farmers market in the parking lot of Arlington Medical Center (on 57th and Market Streets) in collaboration with North Oakland Pediatrics to offer their community healthy food and resources. They ensure their produce is affordable food by keeping prices “low and having all vendors accept WIC vouchers.” Besides providing healthy, affordable food, there is also entertainment like live music, face painting; and educational components like health, anti-police brutality workshops and free cooking demos.\n\nPhat beets moved the North Oakland Arlington Center in June 2013 to 942 Stanford Avenue (at Lowell Street) to utilize an abandoned building at the corner of Stanford and Lowell. This building provides a “unique opportunity to expand the market, and to hold it at a visible space” that will be used as a community gathering area. The farmers market offers a healthy cafe and a kitchen that will be used as a “business incubator” for food entrepreneurs (see Community Healthy Food Business Incubator Kitchen Program section). The kitchen is intended to help boost the local economy, by giving disadvantaged residents the chance to create their own businesses.\n\nBeet Boxes are boxes that are packed with 11 to 14 organic and pesticide-free fruits and vegetables that were locally grown by small farmers. Small farmers are those whose farms do not exceed 40 acres in land. Local residents can purchase and pick up these boxes at one of Phat Beets Produce’s locations in Oakland. The Beet Boxes reflect the “Community Supported Agriculture” model. Community supported agriculture is an alternative economic model to increase self-sustainability and just food distribution in the community while improving the environment. The increased demand of Beet Boxes is a reflection of the growing interest in urban gardening and food justice in Oakland. According to the Urban Food Systems Coordinator, Max Cadji in 2013, “We started the Beet Box two years ago with five members and we now have we over 250 active members with about 125 boxes being delivered each week.” As of 2014, Phat Beets Produce delivers up to 180 Beet Boxes every week. On their website, Phat Beets Produce updates the different types of foods that will be in each Beet Box for that week. This community supported agriculture model is beneficial to both the farmers and the consumers. The farmers are able to earn money from their crops early in the season, which is important for maintaining a positive cash flows. Consumers benefit by obtaining fresh ingredients that are in season and become exposed to a wider variety of foods through the process. Some other community supported agriculture organizations in the East Bay include: Eatwell Farm, Eat Outside the Box, Farm Fresh To You, Full Belly Farm, Happy Child CSA, and Marin Sun Farms.\n\nIn 2009, Phat Beets Produce partnered up with the Children’s Hospital in Oakland to create an obesity prevention program for Oakland youth. Obesity is a growing health problem in urban communities where opportunity to exercise and access to healthy food is limited. According to a study conducted by Rice University in 2012, children that live in poorer communities are 30% more likely to become obese than their counterparts in wealthy neighborhoods. Some of the risk factors that contribute to childhood obesity include the prevalence of sugary and processed foods, television advertisements and media portrayal of fast foods, unsafe neighborhoods that discourage exercise, and lack of breastfeeding. Overall, a combination of lack of exercise and a poor diet leads to severe consequences in terms of this burden of chronic disease. Another important issue in urban communities like Oakland is the development and growth of food deserts in these regions. A food desert is an urban neighborhood without access to affordable and healthy foods. Hence, the residents only have fast food or convenience stores to fulfill their nutritional needs. Continued consumption of low-nutrition food contributes to a greater prevalence of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. According to the Economic Research Service from the USDA, there are 23.5 million people who currently live in food deserts. A disproportionate amount of these residents are low-income and under-resourced citizens. According to the USDA, the official definition of a food desert is “census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlet.” Low-income is a “poverty rate of 20 percent or greater or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the area median family income.” Low-access means that “500 people or 33% or of the tract population live more than a mile away from a grocery store.” The Federal government is working to reduce the number of food deserts in the United States. The 2011 budget included $150 million in private and public investments for programs that will promote healthy food alternatives in food deserts. \n\nIn order to combat the growing obesity problem and reduce food deserts, the Healthy Hearts Youth Empowerment program promotes healthy living practices by teaching youth how to create their own urban garden, grow their own food, and change their diets to improve overall health. The youth in the program are encouraged to learn how to cook by themselves and make conscious and healthy choices when selecting food for consumption. The underlying idea behind this program is to promote health education among the youth. By promoting a healthy eating lifestyle, the program hopes that the participants will be able to bring what they learned back to their own family and community. Each cycle of this program consists of a group of 8-12 students. In terms of community gardening, they have transformed the ¼ acre plot (approximately 10,000 sq. ft) in Dover Street Park into arable land. This urban garden has produced over 3000 pounds of produce every year. The produce is sold to local residents in the community through the Phat Beet Produce’s clinic based farm stands. In addition, this partnership has a “Fresh Fellows” food justice program that specifically targets teenagers who are at risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The “Fresh Fellows” program is dedicated to teaching the teenagers to be leaders in the food justice system. Over the years, this program has trained over 60 youth leaders. One of the participants in the 2011 summer session stated “Well I’m going to bring to my community to more gardens, activities with more peers, more hands on gardening activities because we don’t have enough of that. But I feel like I would take basically everything I learned here to my community and my family because I feel like if I could benefit from it then someone else can benefit from it. ” Urban gardening is positively correlated with health benefits in the community. Residents are more willing to eat the food they grow, benefit from the exercise of tending to gardens, and feel safe and involved in their community.\n\nThere is a growing trend of converting urban land into gardens or community space. In Richmond, the Richmond Greenway Project has transformed previously unused railroad land into a bicycle and pedestrian-safe community with plenty of open space. The purpose of this project is to provide residents easy access to the outdoors while promoting healthy exercising activities like bicycling. The land that was once occupied by the Atchison-Topeka and Santa Fe railroad has now been transformed into 3 miles of biking and walking trails, and over 32 acres of open space. \nHospitals, like Kaiser Permanente, are trying to integrate nature into their facilities. At the Oakland Medical Center branch, they have created a Serenity Garden that displays many plants native to the community, with the hope that the increase in nature will be beneficial and therapeutive to patients.\n\nIn 2014, Phat Beets Produce added another youth program focused on entrepreneurship and gaining work experience. The Phat Beetz Pickle Company is a joint cooperation between the “Fresh Fellows” and the Kitchen Incubator program. This pilot program goes toward developing the work skills of Oakland youth by providing job employment opportunities through the production and sales of pickles and jams. The pickles and jams are sold online, at local cafes, and at the Phat Beets’ farmers market. The goal is to make enough money through sales to fund the participants and the youth company. Furthermore, this program helps generate a source of finance for the participants and acts as a stepping stone to future employment opportunities. The goal is to make enough money with pickle company to fund youth.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, Phat Beets Produce launched the Community Healthy Food Business Incubator Kitchen Program to support local low-income vendors. With the support of the Alameda County Health Department, the collaboration aims to help local vendors and residents successfully start up their own business. It is specifically built to help people of color, the economically disadvantaged, and the under-resourced. The financial component of this project gives business one year’s worth of subsidized resources – including liability insurance, food safety training, kitchen equipment, lease space, and workshops focusing on financial literacy. The long-term goal of this program is to develop a strong marketing cooperative and community. In addition, the program tests out the implementation of the Cottage Food Bill that was enacted in January 2013. The Cottage Food Bill allows small business owners to produce certain non-perishable foods in home kitchens once they acquire a permit. Hence, small vendors would not have to rent or lease a place to sell their food. This would greatly reduce the start-up capital needed to create an entrepreneurship or small business. Vendors would be able to invest this capital into other areas of their business that lack funding. Ever since the bill passed in 2013, 1000 microbusinesses have developed to take advantage of this policy. However, one of the criticisms of this bill is the different permit fees based on location. For example, if one lived in Santa Clara Class A permits are $219 annually and Class B permits are $635, whereas in Alameda, Class A permits cost $162 and Class B permits cost $243. Class A permits allow businesses to directly sell to customers and Class B permits allow sales through a third party—a store or retailer. These differences in fee costs provide obstacles for small business owners to navigate through the system.</ref>\n\nThe primary purpose of the food business incubator kitchen program is to support small businesses and reinvest resources back into the local community. A major barrier for small vendors is the lack of capital resources and business knowledge. Hence, this program aims to provide support for first time entrepreneurs in the community. In the long term, the idea is that if more business and employment is created in the area, the community would be self-sustainable without interference from outside big businesses. As a result, there would be no need for residents to move out of the area.\n\nPhat Beets position on social issues stems in large part from the civil rights movement and political groups such as The Black Panther Party. Phat Beets incorporates the fundamental ideas of these movements and organizations into their own mission, such as the right to have equal access to food and education. The Black Panther’s Free Breakfast for Children Program is similar to Phat Beet’s farmer’s markets because they share the value that a community must have healthy and nutritious diets in order to perform at their best to improve their communities. Furthermore, The Black Panther Party, like Phat Beets, believes that “anti-hunger efforts and food-centered campaigns were driven by an implicit understanding of the power of food in battles over racialized definitions of personhood, a forum for both enforcing and resisting hegemonic authority.” In other words, these organizations believe that food programs are essential to battling unjust social conditions. Phat Beets continues to promote on food justice notions by providing workshops, like Food N’Justice workshops, to explain how health and food can be used as opportunities for social change.\n\nALBA (Agriculture Based Training Association), The People’s Grocery, OBUGS, St.Martin De Porress Elementary, The Healthy Hearts Clinic at the Children’s Hospital Oakland, Arlington Medical Center, The Dover St Neighborhood Group, Oakland Local.\n\nThe North Oakland Restorative Justice Alliance or council is made up of many different community organizations such as Bethany Baptist Church, the Bay Area Youth empowerment project and Phat Beets Produce. Phat Beets Produce and others suggest that the fight for food justice is beyond just giving access to fresh fruits and vegetables for people who would not otherwise have it. It is about making the community a safer place overall, where people can thrive and live their lives to the fullest extent. Therefore, the North Oakland Restorative justice council was founded to help the community deal and challenge both institutional and interpersonal violence. Their main goals are to promote urban gardening and greening, anti-displacement projects, campaigning, and promoting community safety with economic development, through the process of restorative justice. Restorative justice is a collective reaction to an offense in which the community or the groups of people involved get together to figure out what to do as a response, as well as figuring out the implications for the future. Restorative justice is centered around both rehabilitating the victim and the offender but also not criminalizing the wrongdoer and try to integrate them back into the community while simultaneously making them responsible for their actions. Some specific actions Phat Beets is taking to meet these restorative justice goals are creating programs for youth in which they can practice art and food production in public spaces and hosting restorative justice circles to help mitigate neighborhood crime and help colored communities who face displacement and racial profiling.\n\nPhat Beets understands problems in the community to be cyclical and highlights the connection of how food issues can affect housing through structural racism or gentrification. Dealing with community safety for Phat Beets Produce also means making sure that police are not racially profiling their members and their community. Maurice, one of the founders of the organization had this to say about the interconnectedness of food justice issues to much larger issues. “We’re not about just food justice. Food justice is our platform because we’re passionate about food. But anti-violence and restorative justice are just as important as food justice. As is racial, economic, and housing justice. Without an intersectional analysis, the organization cannot adequately address the intersectional nature of food injustice.”. Thus, Phat Beets strives to make connections between all of the inequality that may exist in the community as they see it all ties back to food justice issues.\n\nThe leading cause of death for men in Oakland is heart disease and for African American men like Ken Shandy, they are 20 times more likely to suffer from heart disease than white males. This accounts for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between whites and blacks. That is because African American men are more vulnerable to social conditions that lead to heart disease such as lack of access to healthy food, lack of safe green space to exercise, and hypertension, among other environmental factors. This lack access to healthy food, is one of the main causes for diet-related diseases in low income communities of color, some of these conditions include type II diabetes, heart disease, various forms of cancers and other preventable diseases. In low income areas diets that are affordable and accessible are generally high in refined grains, added grains, and added fats which might fill up someone’s stomach for a short time but are extremely nutrient poor, often leading to higher risk of disease and higher mortality. These nutrient poor diets have also been an independent predictor in many studies of obesity and metabolic syndrome.\n\nPhat Beets believes that these diets are not being consumed by choice, and that physical proximity to healthy food choices is a huge indicator in diet quality. In other words, the better access one has to supermarkets the more one will consume fresh fruits and vegetables. One of the ways Phat Beets attempts to combat these diet-related diseases is through food justice work, for example by coordinating the creation of produce stands and farmers markets to make fresh fruits and vegetables more easily accessible to historically marginalized groups. Ken Shandy, a longtime North Oakland resident, is the perfect example of how Phat Beets Produce aims to change lives. Ken Shandy suffers from heart disease and is working with SOS juice, Farms to Grow, and Phat Beets Produce to gain access to knowledge about food, how to live a healthy life, and gain access to fresh fruits and vegetables. His goal is to lose 250 pounds to better his life and the life of his son. To achieve his goal he is boycotting fast foods, juicing daily, and installing a 5,000 sq ft organic produce garden in an empty lot next to his house. With the help of Phat Beets Produce he is also receiving a weekly produce beet box each week for the next year to supplement his juicing from the garden. Ken is an example of a person in the community that would otherwise not be able to afford or have access to a health lifestyle. Ken not only seeks to change his life and his family’s through this project but also wishes to set an example to help prevent diet-related illness in his community. Most community members cannot afford organic produce and must resort to dangerous diets that include high fructose corn syrup and soy. Phat Beets attempts to assist its members to change their lifestyles and help get rid of high diet-related illness in the community, through urban organic gardening.\n\nOne of Phat Beets Produce’s prized programs is Decolonize your diet. This program strives to liberate community members and helps people claim back their culture through food. Decolonize your diet was first started on what they call, indigenous day, which is an alternative to Columbus Day as it counters the narrative of Christopher Colombus discovering the new world and bringing civilization to it. Phat Beets tries to encourage people in the community to go back to their roots and learn about what has happened throughout the history of colonization and how it has been manifested in their diets. Decolonizing your diet addresses the issue of food justice in how poor people and people of color are poisoned by the foods that are accessible to them. In addition, Phat Beets calls for a further analysis of food justice overall that in order to understand such phenomena as “food deserts,” and unequal health outcomes in low income communities of color their needs to be a focus and understanding of how and why this came to be. Phat Beets stresses that this can be achieved through studying histories of institutionalized racism and disinvestment from low income communities of color.\n\nThe organization does most of its urban gardening at Dover Park Garden, which is known as one of the country’s first and only city parks that have been transformed into an edible garden. This garden is connected to the Healthy Hearts Clinic 7. This is because at the children’s hospital or Arlington Medical center, where the clinic is located doctors often prescribe diets of fruits and vegetables for patients with diet-related illnesses who either can’t afford it, or do not have physical access to it. To make sure that at risk youth can have access to fresh produce, Phat Beets Produce has a program called “Beet Bux,” that provides free vouchers for these patients. The “Beet Bux,” are subsidized by the communities’ purchases of CSA boxes. In addition, Phat Beets Produce provides other access to free produce for those who cannot afford it. However, it’s not just about giving food away, Phat Beets produce makes it a point that along with giving away free food they also must achieve economic empowerment within the community so residents can afford their own produce or learn how to grow their own produce themselves. Using the Black Panther Party’s free breakfast for school children program as a model, Phat Beets produce gives away produce at the medical center once a week. The Black Panther Party is a grassroots organization that has been known to combat violence and poverty in the African American community and is an organization that influences Phat Beets to do their work. Using one of the Black Panther Party’s principles, Phat Beets gives away this produce with the understanding that individuals in the community, “cannot achieve their fullest potential for self determination and revolution without first eating a healthy meal.”\n\nOne of the biggest problems for Phat Beets, as with any small non profit organization is funding. Many of its programs are underfunded and under resourced from the very beginning, but somehow they are able to make things work with the support of the community. Another major issue is Phat Beets Produce’s rhetoric and how they talk about certain issues that can sometimes make their neighbors uncomfortable. This is because Phat Beets addresses some serious and controversial issues in our country such as issues based on race. While speaking of these types of issues has brought trust with organizations combating issues of race, their critique on the state of the country and its race relations has turned away some of its liberal supporters, as it is often politically charged. This has led to upsetting and alienating some of its original supporters which has the potential to limit their financial base and stunt their relationships with their neighbors. Phat Beets produce has received many angry emails and letters, and even cancellations of their CSA boxes due to their controversial stance on some issues such as gentrification. Some of the complaints mentioned that Phat Beets was becoming divisive when it came to issues on gentrification and was accusing rather than uniting the community, due to its extremely politically charged rhetoric. However, Phat Beets still believes that although they could be threatening their financial support not speaking about these controversial issues that low income communities of colors face everyday would be even more dangerous. They believe that even if the organization loses its funding, what’s more important to them is that they opened up the conversation in another direction and made people see another side of the issue.\n\n"}

{"id": "39051720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39051720", "title": "Kalu dodol", "text": "Kalu dodol\n\nKalu dodol (, Tamil: தொடோல்) is a sweet dish, a type of dodol that is popular in Sri Lanka. The dark and sticky dish consists mainly of kithul jaggery (from the sap of the toddy palm), rice flour and coconut milk. Kalu dodol is a very difficult and time-consuming dish to prepare. The Hambanthota area is famous for the production of this dish.\n\nKalu dodol is believed to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by Malay migrants, perhaps from Indonesia. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries.\nWith the introduction of artificial ingredients in recent times, the preparation of kalu dodol has occasionally deviated from the traditional recipes.\n\nKalu dodol, along with other traditional sweets, is commonly prepared and consumed in celebration of the Sinhala New Year. As the process of making the dish is difficult and time-consuming, nowadays most people don't make kalu dodol themselves, instead preferring to buy it from shops.\n\nThe Hambanthota area in southern Sri Lanka is famous for kalu dodol, and is sometimes referred to as the kalu dodol capital. The kalu dodol industry is a major source of income for many people in the area.\n\nThe kalu dodol shops in Hambanthota are frequently visited by pilgrims coming to visit the nearby holy town of Kataragama. In 2011, the Sri Lankan government allocated Rs. 134 million for setting up kalu dodol sales centres in the Hambanthota area, in an effort to develop the industry.\n\nThe main ingredients of kalu dodol are kithul jaggery (from the treacle of the Caryota urens plant), rice flour and coconut milk. Other ingredients such as cashews, cardamom and raisins may be added. It is dark brown in colour and is a thick, sticky and sweet jelly-like dish with a \"slightly granulated\" texture.\n\nTo make the dish, the kithul jaggery and thin coconut milk is mixed and boiled in a large pan until the mixture is reduced to half the original amount. The rice flour, thick coconut milk and the rest of the ingredients are then added. It is necessary to continuously stir the mixture while simmering, to prevent it from burning and sticking to the pan. The oil that floats to the surface of the mixture must also be repeatedly removed. Once the mixture becomes thick, it is poured into a tray, pressed, and left to cool. This labour-intensive process can take up to nine hours. The firm kalu dodol is cut into pieces before serving.\n"}

{"id": "39060718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39060718", "title": "History of breakfast", "text": "History of breakfast\n\nBreakfast is the first meal taken after rising from a night's sleep, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work. The Old English word for dinner, \"disner\", means to break a fast, and was the first meal eaten in the day until its meaning shifted in the mid-13th century. It was not until the 15th century that \"breakfast\" came into use in written English to describe a morning meal, which literally means to break the fasting period of the prior night; in Old English the term was \"morgenmete\" meaning \"morning meal.\"\n\nFrom evidence at Epipaleo sites in present-day Jordan, dating to before the discovery of agriculture, archeologists have recently found that the Natufian culture baked mixed-flour flat breads carefully made from wild einkorn wheat, wild rye, wild oats, lentils and club-rush tubers in tandoor-like stone ovens as well as on flat stones. Besides bread, these wild flours were made into porridge.\n\nFrom further archeology at Neolithic sites we know that there was an early reliance on cereal grains once agriculture had begun. Neolithic peoples used quern-stones to grind the hulled grains, then boiled them to make a kind of porridge. The domesticating of crops is thought to have begun in the Fertile Crescent around 7000 BC. Three of the eight so-called founder crops are cereals – emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, and barley. Rye and oats were cultivated in Europe starting in the early Neolithic in Anatolia before spreading to the rest of Europe in the Iron age and Bronze Age.\n\nPeasants ate a daily meal, most likely in the morning, consisting of beer, bread, and onions before they left for work in the fields or work commanded by the pharaohs.\n\nIn Greek literature, Homer makes numerous mentions of \"ariston\", a meal taken not long after sunrise. The Iliad notes this meal with regard to a labor-weary woodsman eager for a light repast to start his day, preparing it even as he is aching with exhaustion. The opening prose of the 16th book of The Odyssey mentions breakfast as the meal being prepared in the morning before attending to one’s chores. Eventually ariston was moved to around noon, and a new morning meal was introduced.\n\nIn the post-Homeric classical period of Greece, a meal called \"akratisma\" was typically consumed immediately after rising in the morning. Akratisma or ( \"akratismos\") consisted of barley bread dipped in wine ( \"akratos\"), sometimes complemented by figs or olives. They also made pancakes called τηγανίτης (\"tēganitēs\"), ταγηνίτης (\"tagēnitēs\") or ταγηνίας (\"tagēnias\"), all words deriving from τάγηνον (\"tagēnon\"), \"frying pan\". The earliest attested references on \"tagenias\" are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (\"staititēs\"), from σταίτινος (\"staitinos\"), \"of flour or dough of spelt\", derived from σταῖς (\"stais\"), \"flour of spelt\". Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistae mentions \"staititas\" topped with honey, sesame and cheese.\n\nRomans called breakfast \"jentaculum\" (or \"ientaculum\"). It was usually composed of everyday staples like bread, cheese, olives, salad, nuts, raisins, and cold meat left over from the night before. They also drank wine-based drinks such as \"mulsum\", a mixture of wine, honey, and aromatic spices. First-century Latin poet Martial said that jentaculum was eaten at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, while 16th-century scholar Claudius Saumaise wrote that it was typically eaten at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. It seems unlikely that any fixed time was truly assigned for this meal.\n\nRoman soldiers woke up to a breakfast of \"pulmentus\", porridge similar to the Italian polenta, made from roasted spelt wheat or barley that was then pounded and cooked in a cauldron of water.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages, breakfast was not usually considered a necessary and important meal, and was practically nonexistent during the earlier medieval period. Monarchs and their entourages would spend lots of time around a table for meals. Only two formal meals were eaten per day—one at mid-day and one in the evening. The exact times varied by period and region, but this two-meal system remained consistent throughout the Middle Ages.\nThe literal definition of breakfast is ‘breaking the fast’ of nighttime slumber, and many written accounts in the medieval period seem to reprimand eating in the morning.\n\nBreakfast was under Catholic theological criticism. The influential 13th-century Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas wrote in his \"Summa Theologica\" (1265–1274) that breakfast committed \"praepropere,\" or the sin of eating too soon, which was associated with gluttony. Overindulgences and gluttony were frowned upon and were considered boorish by the Catholic Church, as they presumed that if one ate breakfast, it was because one had other lusty appetites as well, such as ale or wine.\n\nBreakfast in some times and places was solely granted to children, the elderly, the sick, and to working men. Anyone else did not speak of or partake in eating in the morning. Eating breakfast meant that one was poor, was a low-status farmer or laborer who truly needed the energy to sustain his morning’s labor, or was too weak to make it to the large, midday dinner. Because medieval people saw gluttony as a sin and a sign of weakness, men were often ashamed of eating breakfast.\n\nNoble travelers were an exception, as they were also permitted to eat breakfast while they were away from home. For instance, in March 1255 about 1512 gallons of wine were delivered to the English King Henry III at the abbey church at St. Albans for his breakfast throughout his trip. If a king were on religious pilgrimage, the ban on breakfast was completely lifted and enough supplies were compensated for the erratic quality of meals at the local cook shops during the trip.\n\nIn the 13th century, breakfast when eaten sometimes consisted of a piece of rye bread and a bit of cheese. Morning meals would not include any meat, and would likely include ¼ gallon (1.1 L; 0.30 US gal) of low alcohol-content beers. Uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals.\n\nBy the 15th century breakfast often included meat. By this time, noble men were seen to indulge in breakfast, making it more of a common practice, and by the early 16th century, recorded expenses for breakfast became customary. The 16th-century introduction of caffeinated beverages into the European diet was part of the consideration to allow breakfast. It was believed that coffee and tea aid the body in \"evacuation of superfluities,\" and was consumed in the morning.\n\nTraditionally, the various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available fruits, cereal grains and vegetables, as well as milk and meat products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features milk, curd and whey products. A type of porridge is most commonly eaten. In the book \"The Bible cyclopædia (et al.)\" published in 1843, it was documented that during this time in the Arab world, Bedouins often utilized locusts mixed with butter for breakfast, spreading the mixture on unleavened bread.\n\nIn the book \"The Bible cyclopædia (et al.)\" published in 1843, it was documented that Egyptians were early risers that sometimes had a first meal consisting of coffee along with the smoking of a pipe, and did not eat breakfast until noon. At this time, it was documented that Egyptian breakfast foods included bread, cheese, eggs, butter, curds, clotted cream and stewed beans. In addition, fava beans (\"Ful Madamas\") are an established national breakfast dish.\n\nIn the Middle East region of Asia, Middle Eastern cuisine is popular. Iftar refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their sawm (fast) during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan, and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is done right after Maghrib (sunset) time. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims replace traditional breakfast with suhoor, an Islamic term referring to the meal consumed early in the morning by Muslims before sawm during daylight hours. The meal is eaten before fajr (dawn).\n\nIn Japan, it is common to eat Miso soup, and rice soup (porridge hybrid jook) for breakfast.\n\nIn the book \"The Bible cyclopædia (et al.)\" it was documented that circa 1843, poor Lebanese people would consume raw leeks with bread for breakfast.\n\nThe croissant appears to have originated in Vienna, Austria, in 1683.\n\nFrench breakfasts are often similar to what Americans call a continental breakfast. French breakfast pastries include apple turnovers, brioche, croissant and pain au chocolat. Croissants have been described as becoming a standard fare in French breakfast cuisine by 1875.\n\nThe word waffle derives from the Dutch word \"wafel\", which itself derives from the Middle Dutch \"wafele,\" and is likely the origin of the food as it is known today.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, some physicians warned against eating breakfast, because they said it was not healthy to eat before a prior meal was digested. By the 1550s, however, there were multiple sources that claimed breakfast was an important meal. For example, in 1551, Thomas Wingfield stated that breakfast was essential. In 1589 Thomas Cogan stated that it was unhealthy to miss breakfast in the morning. He was one of the first to claim that it was healthy for those who were not young, ill or elders to eat breakfast.\n\nThe full breakfast is a staple of British cuisine, and typically consists of bacon, sausages and eggs, often served with a variety of side dishes and a beverage such as coffee or tea. Prior to 1600, breakfast in Great Britain typically included bread, cold meat or fish, and ale. Tea, chocolate and coffee were introduced to Great Britain in the mid-1600s, and in the 1700s coffee and chocolate were adopted as breakfast drinks by the fashionable. Tea eventually became more popular than chocolate as a breakfast drink.\n\nThe first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar were indigenous peoples living in the northeastern part of North America. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region.\n\nWhile it has been a source of controversy where the lumberjack breakfast came from, the most cited source is that the lumberjack breakfast was first served in a Vancouver Hotel, in 1870. The breakfast consisted of eggs galore, assorted fried pork strips, slabs, slices, and flapjacks. It is said by Anita Stewart that the tradition of hearty cooking developed because of men needing the energy for manual labor.\n\nIn 1620, waffles were first introduced to North America by pilgrims who had lived in the Netherlands. Later pioneers consumed largely cornmeal-based breakfasts, and would also consume corn based meals such as oatmeal for dinner and lunch. Common breakfast products included corn pone, Johnnycakes, ashcakes, hoe-cakes, and corn dodgers. Ashcakes consisted of cornmeal wrapped in cabbage leaves cooked in the ashes of a campfire, while corn pone, corn dodgers, and hoe-cakes differed only in baking methods. After the Civil War, it became fairly common in America to eat sandwiches that were made of ham and eggs. These sandwiches were not strictly consumed in the morning. In 1897, the first true breakfast sandwich recipe was published in a cookbook. \nPopcorn cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s, which typically consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener. Cold breakfast cereal has been consumed by Americans since the late 1890s, and during the 1920s a considerable number of new cereals were marketed. The reason for this movement towards cold breakfast cereals was inspired by the Jacksonian-era Clean Living Movement (1830–1860). This movement focused on a lot of lifestyle changes, but specific to breakfast it claimed that eating bacon, eggs, pancakes and hot coffee was too indulgent. The first prepared cold breakfast cereal marketed to American consumers was created by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who introduced it in 1878 and named it granola. The product was prepared with baked wheat, oatmeal and cornmeal, and was the first brand-name breakfast cereal in the United States.\n\nCanned fruit juice became prominent as a breakfast beverage after the discovery of vitamins. Circa 1900, orange juice as a breakfast beverage was a new concept. The development of frozen orange juice concentrate began in 1915, and in the 1930s it was produced by several companies. Additionally, mass-produced tomato juice began to be marketed in the mid-1920s, and became a popular breakfast drink a few years thereafter.\n\n\n\n"}

It is commonly sold in the British port towns of Hartlepool, Kingston upon Hull, Wirral, Liverpool and Thurso. It is a popular item in fish and chip shops, and is consumed either as a snack or as an inexpensive substitute for fish in a fish and chip meal.\n\nThere are additional pattie variations such as the meat pattie (corned beef) and the cheese pattie (cheese and onion), although these are not as popular as the savoury version. In certain parts of the North East and Cumbria fish patties are available also known as fish fritters. These consist of a disc of minced fish sandwiched by two slices of potato (rather than mashed potato as in other patties) and covered in batter. Patties can be of various shapes but are usually round or rectangular. In Hull it may be consumed in a breadcake; this is known as the pattie buttie.\n\nWhen the patties were prepared on an industrial scale in Yorkshire, they were often made by women in white coats and white wellies. The women became known locally as \"Pattie Slappers\" and they had a reputation that you shouldn't argue with them. A study into the lives of the \"Pattie Slappers\" was created into a memory project with Heritage Lottery Funding in 2012.\n\nA version of the pattie appeared as one of the dishes served up in a heat of \"Masterchef\" in 2015, and Ricky Gervais tried one on the BBC programme \"The One Show\".\n\n\n"}

The traditional Jamaican dish is eaten in several Latin American countries that share a coast with the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIt consists of a soup made up of reduced coconut milk with different types of seafood (fish, crabs, small lobsters or shellfish), plantain, yam, tomato, onion and seasonings. Mackerel and salted mackerel is often used in the dish. Other fish are also used, including locally-caught fish, cod, salt cod, shad, other oily fish, red snapper, swordfish Pickled fish, bull pizzle and cassava. Traditionally, the dish is served with side dishes of dumplings or baked breadfruit.\n\nRun down is typically available in Jamaican restaurants, and is also a traditional Jamaican breakfast dish. It is a common dish in the Antilles, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela too.\n\nRondón originated in Jamaica and was exported to Latin America by the Afro-Jamaican immigrant workers who migrated in the early 19th century to build projects such as the Panama Canal and the Costa Rican railroads. The dish is unique to the island, which its population, having left their homes in Africa, Europe, and Asia, were forced to use the limited amount of goods (for example, fish and coconut milk) that were wildly available. Although most Jamaicans are of mixed African descent, the dish is not consumed on the African mainland nor on any other continent. It is now, however, consumed by small minorities on the island of Tobago as well as areas of South and Central America which have Jamaican expats.\n\n\"Rondón\" is a Jamaican Patois anglicism of the words \"run down\", which describes the \"runny\" or \"liquefied\" nature of the sauce. The name could also originate from the manner in which the fish is thoroughly cooked until it falls apart, or \"runs down\".\n\nSince rondón is a traditional dish shared by different countries, the ingredients may vary from region to region. However, coconut milk is an essential ingredient in all the variants.\n\nIn Nicaragua the meat used might be fish, beef, pork or even turtle meat—a common ingredient in Caribbean cuisine but also illegal in some countries—to which seasonings are added. It might include bell peppers, onion, bananas, cassava, elephant's ear and Argan. On the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, the ingredients include cassava, taro, yam, plantain and green bananas. The meat might be fish, lobsters or crabs and spices such as thyme, garlic, onions and yellow lantern chilli or \"chile panameño\", an important ingredient in Costa Rican cuisine. It can be served with flour dumplings. On the Colombian isle of San Andrés, the ingredients used are fish, snails, other seafood or pork. The vegetables include cassava, taro, plantain, potatoes and the spices used include basil, oregano, peppers, onion, garlic and poultry seasoning. In Panama, the seafood prepared with coconut milk can be served with rice, tostones or \"patacones\", and salad.\n\nIn coastal areas of Colombia, \"rundown\" refers to conch stew. This dish may be prepared with conch meat, salt pork, root vegetables, breadfruit and plantains cooked in coconut milk..\n\nIn Trinidad Grenada, and Barbados a similar dish that utilizes palm oil is referred to as \"oil-down\", which is generally prepared with salted beef or pork, breadfruit, palm oil and seasonings boiled in coconut milk until it reaches a thick consistency. This dish is similar to \"yumma\", a Koongo dish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39116001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39116001", "title": "Feu (food)", "text": "Feu (food)\n\nFeu (; also known as Lao beef stew, Lao beef noodle soup or feu noodle soup and sometimes spelled fer) is a long-simmered Lao stew or noodle soup most often made with meat and bones (beef or chicken), vegetables, and herbs. Feu may be served two ways, either as a stew along with steamed rice or as a noodle soup consisting of rice noodles. The English name for this Lao dish is \"feu\", a spelling derived from the Vietnamese phở. The soup is written as in the Lao script.\n\nWhen feu is served with noodles, its English name may be \"feu noodle soup\", \"feu with noodles\", or \"feu noodles\" to distinguish it from the stew itself called \"feu\" that is served with steamed rice.\n\nDepending on personal preference, a wide array of ingredients may be used. A whole onion, a head of garlic, and sliced ginger may be charred and then added to the broth to give it a more intense flavor and aroma. Whenever garlic is used, the Lao typically do not shy away from using a lot of it. Charred lemongrass, sliced galanga, the white bottom of green onions, fresh cilantro stems, and fresh Asian basil stems may also be added to the broth for an additional Lao flair. Celery stalks and optional carrots are sliced and then added to the broth to round out the flavors.\n\nOther ingredients that may also be added to the broth include Sichuan peppers, black peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves, cloves, coriander seeds, black cardamom, cinnamon, and fennel seeds for a fusion of Lao with Chinese flavors.\n\nSalt or fish sauce is also used in the broth along with sugar and sometimes soy sauce or oyster sauce as well. In Laos, beef feu may also include different cuts of beef and bones and sometimes tendons, tripe, and meatballs as ingredients. When making chicken feu, ingredients such as chicken skin, innards, and blood cake may also be used.\n\nRice stick noodles or broad rice noodles are typically used when making feu noodle soup.\n\nThe meat, bones, tendons and/or innards, onion, celery, ginger, and garlic are cooked first in the broth for up to several hours before the remaining herbs and spices are added to the broth and then allowed to simmer for an hour or more before adding additional seasonings such as sugar, salt or fish sauce, and sometimes soy sauce or oyster sauce before the broth is finished. Some of the vegetables and spices may be roasted or charred before adding to the broth to give it a more pronounced flavor.\n\nOptionally, the meat and bones may be browned, by baking in an oven or searing in a pot or wok, before adding to a pot of water to develop a richer flavor and darken the broth. Another optional technique to help remove impurities and produce a clearer broth is parboiling the meat and bones in boiling water for a few minutes, followed by draining out the water from the pot, and then rinsing the parboiled meat and bones with water before adding fresh water to the pot and then allowed to simmer. If a clear broth is desired, impurities that float to the top of the broth should be skimmed off while the broth is simmering.\n\nFeu may be served with or without noodles. If served without noodles, then feu is considered a stew and may be served with steamed rice. If noodles are used, they are cooked in a separate pot of boiling water and then put in a bowl. Thinly sliced raw beef or parboiled beef is also added to the bowl. The broth along with the stewed meat, vegetables, and sometimes bones are ladled into the bowl.\n\nUnique to Laos is the Lao use of fresh lettuce with raw, thinly sliced tomatoes as toppings in Lao noodle soups such as feu, which gives feu a Lao style jolt of color and freshness. The liberal use of fried garlic as a topping to the dish is also common in Laos. Mint leaves and Asian basil leaves may also be added on top of the sliced tomatoes or alongside them to give an additional contrast in shape, texture, and color as the Lao are known for their use of contrasting elements in their cuisine. Fresh cilantro and also thinly sliced green onions and white onions are also added as toppings. Fresh bean sprouts may also be added as a topping as is commonly done for another Lao noodle dish called khao poon.\n\nWhen feu is served with noodles, it is typical in Laos to serve it with a side of fresh Lao chili peppers, shrimp paste, a wedge of lime or lemon, Asian basil, mint leaves, cilantro, lettuce, and bean sprouts. Sugar, fish sauce, chili sauce, and hoisin sauce are also typically provided as condiments on the table.\n\nBeef, chicken, pork, seafood, vegetarian, and oxtail feu are typical variations in Laos. Rice stick noodles or broad rice noodles may also be added to feu. Because different spices, herbs, and vegetables may be used in Laos depending on personal preference, feu may exude a local Lao flare including the use of lemongrass, galanga, and a large amount of garlic in the broth and also the use of sliced raw tomatoes, lettuce, green onions, cilantro, bean sprouts, and fried garlic as toppings. Depending on the region in Laos, other fresh and raw vegetables besides lettuce and tomatoes may also be used as toppings. Feu may also take on additional flavors and aromas from adding ingredients introduced historically from China, France, and India. Salt, fish sauce, soy sauce, or oyster sauce may be used to season the broth in addition to using sugar. When making pork feu, thinly sliced fried pork belly may also be used as a topping.\n\n\n"}

Its preparation is not yet commercial in Nepal, however it is sold in restaurant that serve Newa cuisine. It is about 60% alcohol and can be bought in local Newari restaurants . CNN has noted it as being one of the \"50 most delicious drinks in the world\".\n\nAila is usually prepared by Newari women before any festival or socio-cultural event. Rice along with many other ingredients is mixed with \"Marcha\", a local organic fermenting compound, and fermented at least four to five days to ensure the preparation of a good quality Aila. Millet is used instead of rice for an even stronger flavor. The final product is obtained after distillation. This is done by using traditional clay and brass vessel designed specifically for this purpose. The raw fermented mixture is cooked over a wood fire stove. Temperature of flame and cooling water are the two factors controlling the quality of this beverage during distillation.\n\nConsumption of alcohol is not just allowed but generally encouraged in Newari culture. This is a religious practice promoted by Tantric traditions. According to the Tantric practices, foods are divided into three groups. These food groups are, \"mamsa\" (meat), \"matsya\" (fish) and \"madya\" (alcoholic beverage).\nIt is believed that offering alcohol would satisfy the Tantric Gods who in turn grant followers with good luck.

The drink and brand were created by Jonnie Shearer around 2004. In April 2013 part of the advertising campaign for Pussy was banned in the UK by the Advertising Standards Authority for being sexually explicit.\n\nPussy is made from carbonated water, sugar, grape juice, and a mixture of herbs and other fruit. Its caffeine content comes from guarana. Pussy is advertised as \"100% natural\" as it does not contain artificial additives.\n\nShearer came up with the idea of a natural energy drink after leaving university in 2004. Inspired by the Virgin brand name of Virgin Group, Shearer decided to name his drink Pussy. \n\nShearer launched the company in 2006, and started marketing Pussy in 2007. Initially Shearer ran the company from his bedroom, and delivered the drinks to clubs and bars himself. By the summer of 2011 Pussy was sold in 3000 shops in the UK, including Tesco and Selfridges, and exported to 18 countries, with sales of up to 200,000 cans per month. By April 2012 sales had increased to 500,000 a month.\n\nToday, the company generates approximate revenue of $14.6m and employs 94 people. \n\nIn the winter of 2012 Pussy Drinks Ltd started a UK advertising campaign with two styles of posters used on billboards and trailers. The first advert features the word \"Pussy\" in large lower-case letters above the phrase \"The drink's pure, it's your mind that's the problem.\" with a picture of a can to the right. The second advert featured the word \"Outrageous.\" in large letters above the phrase \"An energy drink that actually tastes good.\" with a picture of a can to the left.\n\nThe ASA received 156 complaints about the posters of which six issues were considered. The ASA accepted that people would see the word \"pussy\" as a slang term for vagina. The ASA suggested that Pussy Drinks Ltd were aware of the double meaning and played upon it in the first poster, referring to secondary meaning which was not \"pure\" and was a \"problem\". As such the poster was deemed sexually explicit and offensive. The ASA also ruled that older children would be aware of the double meaning, the poster was unsuitable to be placed where children might see it. Similar complaints about the second poster were disallowed, as were complaints that the first poster was offensive to religious people. Two of the issues were upheld, and the ASA banned the first poster.\n\nPussy Drinks Ltd responded by claiming to use the Oxford English Dictionary meaning of the word \"pussy\", and that the brand name was influenced by a vagina. They feigned innocence and questioned why people would assume a vulgar meaning of the word. They also asked why religious people would be offended as the ancient Egyptians worshipped cats. Richard Branson compared the ASA's banning of one Pussy advert to the banning of the Sex Pistols in the 1970s, saying that the ban would increase brand exposure and sales, a process known as the Streisand effect.\n\nSince 2009 Pussy has been endorsed by two-time World Superbike champion Troy Corser, who sometimes promotes the drink on his headgear.\n\n"}

The word codice_1 is also used in languages influenced by C, such as Java.\n\nIn C, codice_1 is a storage class (not to be confused with classes in object-oriented programming), as are codice_4, codice_5 and codice_6 (which are also reserved words). Every variable and function has one of these storage classes; if a declaration does not specify the storage class, a context-dependent default is used:\n\nIn these languages, the term \"static variable\" has two meanings which are easy to confuse:\nVariables with storage class codice_4, which include variables declared at top level without an explicit storage class, are codice_1 in the first meaning but not the second.\n\nThe codice_1 keyword when prefixed while declaring a variable or a function can have other effects depending on where the declaration occurs. \nA variable declared as codice_1 at the top level of a source file (outside any function definitions) is only visible throughout that file (\"file scope\", also known as \"internal linkage\"). In this usage, the keyword codice_1 is known as an \"access specifier\".\n\nSimilarly, a static functiona function declared as codice_1 at the top level of a source file (outside any class definitions)is only visible throughout that file (\"file scope\", also known as \"internal linkage\").\n\nVariables declared as codice_1 inside a function are statically allocated, thus keep their memory cell throughout all program execution, while having the same scope of visibility as automatic local variables (codice_5 and codice_6), meaning remain local to the function.

Throughout the 20th century, there was a huge increase in global production, mainly due to a rise in available, developed land throughout Europe, North America and Africa.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, various kinds of bread are made, all sourdough, the differences depending mainly on the type of flour used. Loaves sold in supermarkets are not packed, however, when the loaves are being sold cut in half, shops are required to wrap them in a plastic bag. Non-sourdough sliced bread is called \"toustový chléb\" (toast bread) and is used only for making toasts.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Danish bakers in the larger towns baked fresh bread in the morning. This bread, called \"morgenbrød\", made primarily from wheat and intended for the rising bourgeoisie, was baked into various shapes and with a variety of seasonings. Since then, this freshly baked bread has been produced in every Danish baker's shop, along with a variety of other breads. This decentralised form of baking bread alongside the more modern industrialised production of bread seems to be characteristic of the Danish bread sector. Consumption, to a great extent, has switched from rye bread to wheat bread.\n\nIn France, pan bread is known as \"pain de mie\" and is used only for toast or for making stuffing; standard bread (in the form of baguettes or thicker breads) has a thick crust and often has large bubbles of air inside. It is often baked three times daily and is sold totally unwrapped for a crisp crust. Some fancy breads contain walnuts or are encrusted with poppy seeds.\n\nGermany prides itself on having the largest variety of breads worldwide. More than 300 basic kinds of bread are produced with more than 1,000 types of small bread-rolls and pastries. It has been estimated that the basic kinds of bread are so widely varied by more than 16,000 local bakeries that more than 1,000 different breads have been presented at a 2005 Cologne bread show. Germans are worldwide the biggest consumers (per capita) of bread, followed by Chile. In 2012 there were 13,666 bakeries in Germany, but the number has been steadily declining, mainly in favour of supermarkets. 3090 different kinds of bread are listed in the German Bread Registry. Popularity of kinds of bread: mixed bread (wheat and rye) 31.8%, toast bread 21.6%, bread with grains and seeds 14.8%, brown bread 11.5% \n\nFinland and Russia both have dark sourdough breads made of rye. Traditional Finnish rye bread is disc-shaped, with a hole in the center for easier storing. These breads have a rougher composition and a stronger taste than wheat bread, and can thus be stored for longer periods. Some families have leaven cultures, handed down from one generation to the next, that they use for baking these breads. Bread is made from all four of the cereals grown in Finland: wheat, rye, barley and oats; these are usually ground into various grades. Rye bread can be either light or dark in colour, depending on the type of flour mixture used. A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. Some of the breads are thinner, multigrain types, such as elongated \"sekaleipä\". \"Vesirinkeli\" (water rings) are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread, which resemble bagels. The potato, although a late introduction to Finland in the early 19th century, features heavily in food culture and has found its way into many kinds of bread.\n\nWith the settlement of Iceland about 800–900 AD, grain, in the form of barley, was brought, cultivated and used for bread and porridge. Grain cultivation is thought to have been abandoned before 1600 due to harsher climatic conditions, and, subsequent to this, most grains such as barley and rye were imported. The scarcity of grain was overcome in different ways in different parts of the country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using dulse (\"Palmaria palmata\"; in Icelandic, \"söl\"), Iceland moss (\"Cetraria islandica\"; in Icelandic, \"fjallagrös\") or Irish moss (\"Chondrus crispus\"; in Icelandic, \"fjörugrös\") in compotes and breads. It was not until the 18th century that it became common practice to make leavened rye breads; sourdough was mostly used. Rye breads baked in hot springs are a popular item today, and are served for local consumption as well as for tourists. In general, stock fish (\"harðfiskur\") was served as a bread substitute, eaten with butter on the side with almost every meal. Today, it is a popular snack that has found a new target group within the sports food market because of its high-protein and favourable amino acid content. Most types of breads available in other Western countries are now also available in Iceland, either baked in Iceland or imported. Everyday bread is mostly made by industrial bakeries or at the local bakery. Of the bread types currently available, \"flatbrauð\" (flatbread) and \"laufabrauð\" (leaf bread) have the longest history. Iceland's First and oldest bakery is Bernöftsbakari founded 25. September 1834.\n\nBecause of its long history of regional political division, Italy specializes in many different kinds of bread, reflecting its great regional variation and widely different breadmaking recipes and traditions. In general, rolls are typical of the northern regions, while large loaves are typical of the southern regions. Bread often has a small quantity of olive oil, butter, or rendered lard mixed into the dough to make it softer and more palatable. Traditional rustic breads include \"sfilatino imbottito\" (a stuffed bread roll) and \"pizza bianca\" (a flat white bread). \"Focaccia\" is quite popular in Italy and southern France. In Provence, it is known as \"fougasse\" or \"fouace\", with the former becoming increasingly common. Fougasse can now be bought all over France. It is usually seasoned with olive oil and herbs, and often either topped with cheese or stuffed with meat or vegetables. Focaccia doughs are similar in style and texture to pizza doughs. \"Pane in cassetta\" and \"pan carré\" are low grade factory produced convenience foods sold in all Italian supermarkets. They are very light, contain preservatives (e.g. ethyl alcohol) and have a very long shelf life (often more than a month).\n\nIn Ireland it is traditionally held that the end of a loaf of bread (the \"heel\" of the loaf) is the best part of the loaf. Other stories and myths surround this piece of the bread in Irish mythology. Irish soda bread, developed to make the most of the soft wheat grown in Ireland, is unusual for a European bread in that it is a quick bread, using the reaction of buttermilk and baking soda rather than yeast to rise. Another traditional Irish bread is barmbrack, a yeasted bread with added sultanas and raisins, customarily consumed at Halloween. Potato bread is also traditional in Ireland, especially in Ulster.\n\nMany new types of bread have reached the markets in Norway in recent years. A high percentage of people reported regularly eating bread types such as spelt, speciality, gourmet, and fibre/bran bread, as well as ciabattas and baguettes, although very few reported doing so on a daily basis. Norwegian bakers now have competition from abroad. The wholegrain bread from local bakers must give way to huge lorry loads of baguettes and frozen dough offering cheaper products. Flatbread is still a very popular bread type.\n\nBroa de Avintes, also known as Boroa of Avintes, is a farmhouse bread of Avintes, a parish of Vila Nova de Gaia. It has a long tradition in Portugal and is widely consumed in northern part of the country. Folar is a traditional Portuguese bread served at Easter. The recipe varies from region to region and it may be sweet or salty. Portuguese sweet bread is a bread made with milk, sugar and/or honey, eggs, yeast, flour and sometimes lemon peel to produce a subtly sweet lightly textured loaf or rolls.\n\nIn Spain, traditional bread or \"pan\" is a long loaf, similar to the French baguette but wider. One can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries, where there is a large assortment of bread. A smaller version is known as bocadillo, an iconic piece of the Hispanic cuisine. In Spain, especially in the Mediterranean area, there have been guilds of bakers for over 750 years. The bakers guild in Barcelona was founded in 1200 AD. There is a region called Tierra del Pan (\"Land of the Bread\"), located in the province of Zamora, where economy was in the past joined to this activity.\n\nIn Sweden, during the transition to a modern urban and industrialised society in the 19th century, bread types changed when large industrial bakeries introduced new soft bread. From the early 1920s, these were often sweetened. From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variation decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s, and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. Many older bread types still exist alongside the newer varieties.\n\nBread is an integral part of the Turkish cuisine and eaten very commonly. According to Guinness World Records, Turkey has the largest per capita consumption of bread in the world as of 2000, with 199.6 kg (440 lb) per person; Turkey is followed in bread consumption by Serbia and Montenegro with 135 kg (297 lb 9.9 oz), and Bulgaria with 133.1 kg (293 lb 6.9 oz).\n\nAside from the common bread that is shown in the photo, bazlama, gözleme, lavaş, pide, simit, and yufka are popular varieties. In particular, a variety of pita traditionally eaten during Ramadan is called Ramazan pidesi.\n\nThere is a wide variety of traditional breads in Great Britain, often baked in a rectangular tin. Round loaves are also produced, such as the North East England speciality called a stottie cake. A cottage loaf is made of two balls of dough, one on top of the other, to form a figure-of-eight shape. A cob is a small round loaf. There are many variations on bread rolls, such as baps, barms, breadcakes and so on.\n\nThe Chorleywood process for mass-producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide. Mass-produced sliced white bread brands such as Wonderloaf and Mother's Pride have been criticised on grounds of poor nutritional value and taste of the loaves produced.\n\nBrown bread is seen as healthier by many, with popular brands including Allinson and Hovis. Artisanal baking has also seen a resurgence since the 1970s. Rye bread is mostly eaten in the form of Scandinavian-style crisp bread, such as that produced by Ryvita in Birmingham. Malt loaf is a dark, heavy and sweet bread. The popularity of Indian cuisine in Britain means that Indian breads such as naan are made and eaten there. Continental varieties, such as baguettes (also known as \"French sticks\") and focaccia are also made. The consumption of bagels is no longer restricted to the Jewish community.\n\nWales has a sweet bread called bara brith, which includes fruit in the recipe.\n\nIn Scotland a bread called plain bread is also eaten. These loaves are noticeably taller and thinner, with burned crusts at only the top and bottom of the loaf, and with a much firmer texture than English and American pan bread.\n"}

Although yeolmu radish (young summer radish) has small and thin taproots that do not have much use, its thick and abundant green leaves are constantly used throughout spring and summer to make \"yeolmu-kimchi\". \"Yeolmu-kimchi\" is popular in the summer and is often eaten with cold noodles.\n\nIn preparation, all the withered and rugged leaves are removed from the yeolmu radish. The roots remain uncut and the ends are simply trimmed. With a knife, the thick roots are gently scraped and all the soil is removed from the young radish. Afterwards, it is sprinkled with salt water. Green onions are cut diagonally and the garlic and ginger are mashed. The red pepper is sliced into small bits.\n\nIn the immersion process, the yeolmu is slightly washed and cut into pieces convenient for eating. Afterwards, the red pepper, the mashed garlic, the ginger, the green onions and shrimp sauce are mixed together with the young radish. At the end, a small amount of salt water is added to the mixture.\n\nDue to the softness and flavor of the leaves, they are the primary ingredients in many foods rather than the roots (the white radish). The leaves are alkaline foods rich in fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and low in calories. When picking out yeolmu, young, small and thin ones are recommended over the aged yeolmu, which tend to be thicker. It is recommended that Yeolmu is eaten as soon as possible due to the fact that it withers quickly. Any leftovers are stored in refrigeration.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, Yeolmu Kimchi was voted as people's favourite type of Kimchi (excluding Napa Cabbage Kimchi, which is the most commonly eaten type of Kimchi) in an online poll. In the poll, which involved a total of 3532 bloggers, Yeolmu Kimchi received 875 (24.8%) votes. Dongchimi came 2nd with 13.9% of the votes.\n\n"}

{"id": "39382303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39382303", "title": "Soylent (meal replacement)", "text": "Soylent (meal replacement)\n\nSoylent is a brand of meal replacement products available in the United States, named after the food product in the science-fiction novel \"Make Room! Make Room!\" Soylent was introduced in 2014 after a crowdfunding campaign that generated nearly $1.5 million in preorders.\n\nRosa Foods, Soylent's producer, says that the formulation that uses genetically modified food is based on recommendations of the National Academy of Medicine. They established an FDA nutrition facts label and said the product meets the criteria for some health-related claims. Rosa Foods also states that Soylent includes all of the elements of a healthy diet, without excessive amounts of sugar, saturated fat, or cholesterol. \n\nIn January 2013, software engineer Rob Rhinehart purchased 35 chemical ingredients—including potassium gluconate, calcium carbonate, monosodium phosphate, maltodextrin, olive oil—all of which he deemed to be necessary for survival, based on his readings of biochemistry textbooks and U.S. government websites. Rhinehart used to view food as a time-consuming hassle and had resolved to treat it as an engineering problem.\n\nHe blended the ingredients with water and consumed only this drink for the next 30 days. Over the course of the next two months, he adjusted the proportions of the ingredients to counter various health issues and further refined the formula. Rhinehart claimed a host of health benefits from the drink and noted that it had greatly reduced his monthly food bill, which fell from about US$470 to $50, and the time spent behind the preparation and consumption of food whilst providing him greater control over his nutrition.\n\nSoylent is named after a food in Harry Harrison's 1966 science fiction novel \"Make Room! Make Room!\" In the novel, most types of \"soylent\" are made from soy and lentils. The word also evokes the 1973 film adaptation \"Soylent Green\", in which the eponymous food is made from human remains. Rhinehart also says he chose the name, with its morbid associations, to pique curiosity and deeper investigation, since the name was clearly not chosen with a traditionally \"flashy\" marketing scheme in mind.\n\nIn 2013, a community of people interested in making their own Soylent emerged online, attracted by the ability to customize nutrition precisely to each person's unique needs. Another software engineer, Nick Poulden, founded the web site diy.soylent.me (now www.completefoods.co), where users shared the results of their own tinkering with the Soylent recipe. Users could enter a nutritional profile and select a recipe, and the web site would calculate exact proportions of each ingredient to yield the desired intake of each nutrient. Zach Alexander, a former professional cook, made a Soylent formula mostly from ingredients available at grocery stores rather than laboratory supply houses, which he calls Hackerschool Soylent.\n\nRhinehart's blog posts about his experiment attracted attention on Hacker News, eventually leading to a crowdfunding campaign on Tilt that raised about $1.5 million in preorders aimed at moving the powdered drink from concept into production. It became one of the most funded crowdfunding projects ever accomplished. After the campaign, Soylent had venture capital financing for a seed round of $1.5 million to further develop proof of concept. Media reports detailed how operations began for Rosa Foods in April 2014, using a relatively small $500 system to ship the first $2.6 million worth of product. In January 2015, Soylent received $20 million in Series A round funding, led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nPrior to June 2015, Soylent was only available for purchase and shipment to people in the United States. On June 15, 2015, the shipping of Soylent to Canada was introduced at the same price in U.S. dollars as for U.S. customers. Expansion to European countries is a stated future goal. In October 2017, Canada disallowed further shipments of Soylent due to a failure to meet Canadian food regulations on meal replacements.\n\nIn July 2017, Soylent was sold offline for the first time at 7-Eleven stores around Los Angeles. By April 2018, Soylent was sold in over 8,000 7-Elevens around the United States and it is planned to be sold in Walmart.\n\nSoylent Powder is a powder that must be mixed with water to make a drink. The formulas for versions 1.0–1.8 have been published and are freely available. Since version 1.2, all versions have been vegan (i.e., containing no eggs, dairy, or other animal-derived substances).\n\nSoylent Drink, originally called Soylent 2.0, is premixed Soylent with various flavorings added, sold in a bottle.\n\nSoylent Cafe is Soylent Drink mixed with caffeine, L-theanine, and different flavorings. Soylent Cafe was originally called \"Coffiest\", after an extremely habit-forming drink in the 1952 science fiction novel \"The Space Merchants\", by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth, which gets every customer \"hooked for life\".\nSoylent Bridge is a smaller version of Soylent Cacao. At 180 calories, it is intended more as a snack than a complete meal. Each bottle contains 15 grams of protein and 10–15% of most vitamins.\n\nSoylent Bar was Soylent in the form of a solid, edible bar. It was discontinued in October 2016 after reports of gastrointestinal problems.\nThe makers of Soylent say it contains all the nutrients necessary for a healthy lifestyle. There may be social drawbacks of living on a Soylent-only diet, since some critics have said that it comes at the expense of the pleasures from eating and sharing food.\n\nSome people have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms from consumption of Soylent. Speculation on the cause of such symptoms sometimes centered around the amount of dietary fiber contained in the product, which is known to cause such symptoms when diets are abruptly altered to increase amounts of fiber consumption. Later versions of the product lowered the amount of fiber content, but this did not stop the reports of gastrointestinal problems. The lower fiber content of the product led to additional criticisms of not containing an adequate amount, compared to daily recommendations, leading some to utilize fiber supplementation.\n\nAs of October 24, 2017, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is blocking sales of Soylent from Canada on the premise that the label on Soylent does not meet the CFIA requirements to be listed as a meal replacement. Shipping Soylent to Canada has been blocked by the CFIA until Rosa Foods makes changes to its products; Canadian shipments first began in June 2015.\n\nOn August 13, 2015, nonprofit environmental and corporate social responsibility watchdog As You Sow filed a notice of intent to pursue a lawsuit against the makers of Soylent, claiming that Soylent did not adequately label its product given the levels of lead and cadmium present in the drink. The basis for the lawsuit lies in California's Proposition 65, a law that requires additional labeling for food products containing trace amounts of certain substances.\n\nAlthough Soylent contains levels of lead and cadmium far below the national safety levels set by the FDA, it does contain 12 to 25 times the level of lead and 4 times the level of cadmium allowable in a product without additional labeling as specified by Proposition 65. A lawyer who has worked on settlements of Proposition 65 suits described the case as \"alarmist\", as the levels are well below FDA limits of what is allowed in food products. However, as Soylent is marketed as a complete meal replacement, many customers consume the drinks three times a day, equating to 36 to 75 times the lead and 12 times the level of cadmium without the Prop 65 label. As You Sow believes these levels may be harmful. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, and even at low levels is linked to nerve damage, lower IQ, and reproductive problems including decreased sperm count. Cadmium is also a toxic heavy metal and has been linked to kidney, liver, and bone damage.\n\nSoylent's website displays the Proposition 65 warning required by California. Rosa Foods published the position that the levels of heavy metal content in Soylent \"are in no way toxic, and Soylent remains completely safe and nutritious\". Rosa Foods also published an infographic and spreadsheet based on an FDA study of heavy metal content in common foods, comparing two selected example meals to servings of Soylent with a similar amount of caloric intake. Both of the company's chosen comparison meals include high levels of cadmium and arsenic, along with levels of lead similar to those of Soylent; although one of them includes tuna and the other includes salmon, providing over 97% of the arsenic in each proposed meal, with spinach providing 74% of the cadmium in the higher-cadmium meal and fruit cocktail providing 71% of the lead in the higher-lead meal.\n\nOn October 12, 2016, the company announced it would halt sales of the Soylent Bar due to reports of gastrointestinal illness, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The company asked customers to discard any unconsumed bars and said it would offer full refunds. On October 21, 2016, the company triggered a product recall, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced it had commenced a food safety investigation.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, the company also halted sales of Soylent Powder. The company said tests on the bar had come back negative for contamination, but also said that some powder users had reported similar stomach-related symptoms from consuming the powder.\n\nThe company initially suspected soy or sucralose intolerance. However, on November 7, 2016, Soylent instead blamed algal flour for making people sick, and said it planned to remove algal flour from future formulations of the powders and bars, which it did in the next formulation version 1.7 introduced on December 15, 2016. The drink-based products use algal oil, not algal flour, so were deemed to be safe for users.\n\nTerraVia, the supplier of Soylent's algal ingredients, published a fact sheet in response to media coverage for its algal flour.\n\nRhinehart called the flavor of the original versions \"minimal\", \"broad\" and \"nonspecific\". \nSoylent 1.0 contains soy lecithin and sucralose as masking flavors and to adjust appearance, texture and smell.\nBefore version 1.4, vanillin was included as an ingredient for flavoring.\n\nDylan Matthews of \"The Washington Post\" noted in 2013 that Soylent fulfills a similar need as medical foods such as Abbott Laboratories's Jevity, but for a much lower cost.\n\nReviews on the taste of powdered Soylent vary. One reviewer said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" with the \"rich, creamy, and strangely satisfying\" flavor, and another likened it to that of a vanilla milkshake with the texture of pancake batter. Negative reviewers said it tasted \"like someone wrung out a dishtowel into a glass\", said \"my mouth tastes hot and like old cheese\", or that it was \"purposefully bland\", \"vile\" and made the taster \"gag\" and compared the taste to \"homemade nontoxic Play-Doh\".\n\nFarhad Manjoo of \"The New York Times\" said he \"found Soylent to be a punishingly boring, joyless product\". Chris Ziegler of \"The Verge\", who experimented with subsisting only on Soylent for almost a month, said that although he liked and \"never really tired of the flavor\", he still concluded that \"Soylent isn't living, it's merely surviving\", and described the apple he ate at the end of that period as \"my first meal back from the abyss\" and the best he'd ever had in his life. Adrian Chen of \"Gawker\" said he \"was having trouble getting it down\", and eventually \"dumped the whole thing in the sink\".\n\nBoth Manjoo and Ziegler said they had experienced some gastrointestinal problems from drinking it. Lee Hutchinson of \"Ars Technica\" also reported a brief period of \"adaptation gas\" at the beginning of a four-day experiment.\n\nAmongst the new flavors, Mocha has been described as similar to a \"caffeinated Nesquik drink,\" and Nectar has been described negatively as tasting like \"lemon aspartame.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Other stalls may offer pomfret, batang. or garoupa. While fish heads or the whole fish may be used, some diners prefer having just fish slices. The fish soup is made out of either fish stock or actual bones, water, oil, yam, and milk, with vegetables and select fruits.\n\nThe noodle in the soup is often bee hoon, although a healthier alternative except for irritable bowel syndrome sufferers would be spaghetti made from brown rice. Another noodle variant would be fried noodles. Additional ingredients include eggs, anchovies, pepper, salt, and alcoholic products such as brandy, Chinese wine, or cognac, chilli slices, fried shallots, and fish roe. For the vegetarian version of the dish, fish meat is substituted with tofu.\n\nThe fish is boiled and added to a bowl of fish soup. The fish may also be fried. The soup is boiled for about twenty minutes, though a broth made from fish or pork bones boiled for several hours is sometimes used as a base. The dish is served hot.\n\nGrace Chen of \"The Star\" writes that fish soup bee hoon is \"to Singaporeans what the char kway teow is to Penangites\". Catherine Ling of \"CNN\" describes fish soup bee hoon as one of the \"40 Singapore foods we can't live without\". Jin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon was named the best fish soup bee hoon store in Singapore by \"Time Out Singapore\" in 2012.\n\n"}

It is mainly headquartered in Dubai, UAE as Foodonclick.com Campus.\n\nYemeksepeti entered the market in Greece in 2013 by investing in local company Click Delivery S.A., operating the website clickdelivery.gr.\n\nYemeksepeti also entered the market in Bulgaria and Romania in 2016 by investing in bgmenu.com in Bulgaria and quicky.ro and oliviera.ro in Romania.\n\nIn May 2015 Yemeksepeti was sold to the German-based Delivery Hero for $589 million (£378 m). Founder Nevzat Aydin paid out $27 million to 114 workers as a profit-sharing bonus, reported to be worth around $237,000 (£152,000) per employee. The bonus is worth roughly 150 times their monthly wage, which is between $1,000 to 2000 per month.\n\nThe company operates as an online real-time intermediary between the ordering user and the delivering restaurant where he/she can use the website as an up-to-date directory to browse different food delivery options in each listed neighborhood and place an online.\n\nThe user has the option to check menus either by cuisine, location, restaurant name or special deals that are on, or make a self-customized order and place it in advance.

{"id": "39561009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39561009", "title": "Infobox", "text": "Infobox\n\nAn infobox is a template used to collect and present a subset of information about its subject, such as a document. It is a structured document containing a set of attribute–value pairs, and in Wikipedia represents a summary of information about the subject of an article. In this way, they are comparable to data tables in some aspects. When presented within the larger document it summarizes, an infobox is often presented in a sidebar format.\n\nAn infobox may be implemented in another document by transcluding it into that document and specifying some or all of the attribute–value pairs associated with that infobox, known as parameterization.\n\nAn infobox may be used to improve the appearance of an article on Wikipedia; they are used on similar articles to ensure consistency of presentation by using a common format. Originally, infoboxes (and templates in general) were used for page layout purposes. An infobox may be transcluded into an article by specifying the value for some or all of its parameters. The parameter name used must be the same as that specified in the infobox template, but any value may be associated to it. The name is delimited from the value by an equals sign. The parameter name may be regarded as an attribute of the article's subject.\n\nOn Wikipedia, an infobox is transcluded into an article by enclosing its name and attribute–value pairs within a double set of braces. The MediaWiki software on which Wikipedia operates then parses the document, for which the infobox and other templates are processed by a template processor. This is a template engine which produces a web document and a style sheet used for presentation of the document. This enables the design of the infobox to be separated from the content it manipulates; that is, the design of the template may be updated without affecting the information within it, and the new design will automatically propagate to all articles that transclude the infobox. Usually, infoboxes are formatted to appear in the top-right corner of a Wikipedia article in the desktop view, or at the top in the mobile view.\n\nPlacement of an infobox within the wikitext of an article is important for accessibility. A best practice is to place them following \"disambiguation\" templates (those that direct readers to articles about topics with similar names) and maintenance templates (such as that marking an article as unreferenced), but before all other content.\n\nBaeza-Yates and King say that some editors find templates such as infoboxes complicated, as the template may hide text about a property or resource that the editor wishes to change; this is exacerbated by chained templates, that is templates transcluded within other templates.\n\nAs of August 2009, English Wikipedia used about infobox templates that collectively used more than attributes. Since then, many have been merged, to reduce redundancy. As of June 2013, there were at least transclusions of the parent template, used by some, but not all, infoboxes, on articles.\n\nThe name of an Infobox is typically \"Infobox [genre]\", however widely used infoboxes may be assigned shorter names, such as \"taxobox\" for taxonomy.\n\nAbout 44.2% of Wikipedia articles contained an infobox in 2008, and about 33% in 2010. Automated semantic knowledge extraction using machine learning algorithms is used to \"extract machine-processable information at a relatively low complexity cost\". However, the low coverage makes it more difficult, though this can be partially overcome by complementing article data with that in categories in which the article is included. The French Wikipedia initiated the project \"Infobox Version 2\" in May 2011.\n\nKnowledge obtained by machine learning can be used to improve an article, such as by using automated software suggestions to editors for adding infobox data. The iPopulator project created a system to add a value to an article's infobox parameter via an automated parsing of the text of that article.\n\nDBpedia uses structured content extracted from infoboxes by machine learning algorithms to create a resource of linked data in a Semantic Web; it has been described by Tim Berners-Lee as \"one of the more famous\" components of the linked data project.\n\nMachine extraction creates a triple consisting of a subject, predicate or relation, and object. Each attribute-value pair of the infobox is used to create an RDF statement using an ontology. This is facilated by the narrower gap between Wikipedia and an ontology than exists between unstructured or free text and an ontology.\nThe semantic relationship between the subject and object is established by the predicate. In the example infobox, the triple (\"crostata\", type, \"tart\") indicates that a crostata is a type of tart. The article's topic is used as the subject, the parameter name is used as the predicate, and the parameter's value as the object. Each type of infobox is mapped to an ontology class, and each property (parameter) within an infobox is mapped to an ontology property. These mappings are used when parsing a Wikipedia article to extract data.\n\nMany Wikipedia infoboxes also include microformat markup, making the text rendered on the page readable by software.\n"}

It is available in many countries across the world in various pack sizes. It is Pernod Ricard's best selling brand by volume. It is a blend of grain spirits and imported Scotch malts. It is commonly available in 1 L, 750 ml, 375 ml and 180 ml bottles and also available in 90 ml and 60 ml bottles. The brand is named after a species of deer famous for its antlers, that is also featured in its logo. It is produced in several company-owned as well as bottler-owned distilleries. It was the first whisky brand launched in India that did not use any artificial flavours.\n\nPernod Ricard has identified Royal Stag along with Seagram's Imperial Blue, Seagram's Blenders Pride, Chivas Regal and Seagram's 100 Pipers as the company's five core brands to build its spirits business in India. Royal Stag sold 12.3 million cases in 2011, toppling Absolut Vodka, to become Pernod Ricard's biggest selling brand in its global portfolio of alcoholic beverages. Royal Stag sold 18 million cases in 2016.\n\nSeagram’s Royal Stag was launched in 1995. The brand redefined the spirits space by not using molasses but choosing instead to pioneer grain spirit blended with Scotch malts. It is named after a deer species known for long antlers. \nIt is the first whisky brand launched in India which did not use any artificial flavour. The whisky is a blend of grain spirits and imported Scotch malts. Seagram's global business was jointly acquired by Pernod Ricard and Diageo in December 2000. The two companies later split Seagram's business based on the previously announced framework agreement signed between them.\n\nIn the calendar year 2001, Royal Stag was selling over 125,000 cases per month and sold approximately 1.75 million cases in 2002. The brand's annualised sales during the 2004 calendar year crossed 3 million cases, and increased to nearly 4 million cases in 2006. Royal Stag was ranked second among Indian spirits brands in Impact International's 2008 list of \"Top 100 Brands at Retail Value\" with a retail value of US$505 million. The brand reported sales of 8 million cases in 2009 and nearly 10.6 million cases in 2010.\n\nRoyal Stag sold 12.3 million cases in 2011, toppling Absolut Vodka which sold 11.3 million cases, to become Pernod Ricard's biggest selling brand in its global portfolio of alcoholic beverages.\n\nPernod Ricard launched a premium version of Royal Stag, called Royal Stag Barrel Select in December 2011 in India, Gulf and a few other Asian markets. In the Indian whisky market, Barrel Select is positioned between the deluxe and premium segment occupied by the company's Royal Stag and Blenders Pride brands respectively. United Kingdom-based branding and packaging consultants CARTILS developed the strategic positioning, branding, bottle shape, packaging and mono carton for Barrel Select. CARTILS felt it was necessary to retain brand familiarity whilst elevating Barrel Select to a more premium level than Royal Stag, to avoid portfolio cannibalisation. The Barrel Select bottle has rectangular shape similar to Royal Stag, but it has been tapered. The bottle also features a dominantly positioned, gold two-tone illustration of the stag that is part of the Royal Stag logo.\n\nRoyal Stag is placed in the deluxe segment of the Indian whisky market and is priced to target the upper middle class aged 25–40 years. The brand's main national competitor, at its price point, is United Spirits Ltd's McDowell's No.1 whisky. Royal Stag also faces competition from Radico Khaitan's 8 PM Royale, Mason & Summers' \"Royal Crown\", United Spirits Ltd's Royal Mist whiskies and Allied Blenders & Distilleries (ABD)'s Officer's Choice Black. Pernod Ricard has identified Royal Stag along with Imperial Blue, Blenders Pride, Chivas Regal and 100 Pipers as the company's five core brands to build its spirits business in India. 5 brands have been divided in 2 categories, Chivas Regal and 100 Pipers come under \"lifestyle business \" category while the other brands, including Royal Stag, are designated as India-made foreign liquor (IMFL). It is marketed in 1 L, 750 ml, 375 ml and 180 ml bottles and also available in 90 ml and 60 ml bottles.\n\nAdvertising alcoholic beverages is banned in India as per the \"Cable Television Network (Regulation) Amendment Bill\", which came into effect on 8 September 2000. To circumvent the ban liquor manufacturers use surrogate advertising or develop associate properties. Royal Stag uses three themes – Mega Movie, Mega Music and Mega Cricket – to promote the brand. According to Seagram India's vice-president of marketing Bikram Basu, \"We've developed Royal Stag Mega Cricket and Royal Stag Mega Movies to promote the brand\". Mega Cricket sells cricket gear, and sponsors cricket events, and Basu claims that Mega Movies sponsors \"around 8–10 national releases of Hollywood movies every year.\" The brand often uses cricketers and Bollywood stars in its advertising. The brand's slogan is: \"It's your life, make it large\".\n\nIn 2006, a Royal Stag advert featuring Harbhajan Singh without his turban, with his hair tumbling down over his shoulders, outraged orthodox Sikhs, who burnt effigies in the city of Amritsar. Sikh clergy and its representative body, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) demanded an apology from Singh and demanded that Pernod Ricard India withdraw the ad, which the SGPC termed, an \"offensive representation which has hurt the feelings of Sikhs.\" Singh later apologised saying, \"I apologise. In case I have hurt the feelings of my people, it was really not my intention.\"\n\nA Royal Stag ad in 2011 featuring Harbhajan Singh, showed him opting to not work in his father's ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. The commercial ends with him asking the viewer, if with his achievements, \"Have I made it large?\" Royal Stag's rival, United Spirits Ltd's McDowell's No. 1 Platinum whisky mocked the ad in its commercial featuring Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The ad showed Harbhajan look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father's factory, asking if he had \"made it large\", only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Dhoni then tells the viewer, \"\"Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar\"\" (If you want to do something in life, then forget large, do something different ). The ad is considered to be a rare example of a spoof in surrogate advertising. \"The Economic Times\" quoted an industry official as saying, \"It is in bad taste, this type of advertising has never been used in the Indian liquor industry.\" Harbhajan served a legal notice to United Spirits Ltd on 18 July 2011 claiming that the commercial mocked him, his family and the Sikh community. The notice was sent to Vijay Mallya, UB Executive vice-chairman SR Gupte, President & CFO Ravi Nedungadi, Deputy President Harish Bhat and Executive VP (Corporate Affairs) Nandini Verma. It was sent by Avtar Kaur, Harbhajan's mother, through his lawyers, Dewani Advocates & Consultants. Kaur stated these kinds of advertisements brought \"disunity and friction\" in the Indian cricket team and could be termed \"anti-national\". The notice also demanded that the company publicly apologise to the family \"through widely-read newspapers as well as television channels prominently\", remove the advertisement within three days of receiving the notice and compensation of . The United Breweries Group withdrew the ad on 22 July 2011 stating that had done so \"in the interest of the game of cricket\" and fearing that the commercial could be \"misused by vested interests to further their own agenda\". The company also stated that the view of the management was that there was no maintainable case.\n\nIn 2002, Seagram signed eight cricketers to endorse Royal Stag, including Harbhajan Singh (India), Marvan Atapattu (Sri Lanka), Wasim Akram (Pakistan), Glenn McGrath (Australia), Jonty Rhodes (South Africa), Mervyn Dillon (West Indies), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), and Andy Flower (Zimbabwe). The campaign was handled by Ogilvy & Mather. Seagram spent on this promotion. Following this contract, in 2004, Pakistan Civil Court ruled that Wasim Akram had hurt sentiments of Muslims and was fined 25,000 Pakistani rupees (£238) and ordered to apologize the nation. While Akram's lawyer maintained stand that Akram had never appeared in any advertisement of alcoholic product.\n\nOther cricketers that have featured as brand ambassadors or have appeared in Royal Stag advertising include Gautam Gambhir, Jonty Rhodes, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ricky Ponting and Yuvraj Singh.\n\nThe brand's first TV commercial with Saif Ali Khan as brand ambassador, aired in 2007. The campaign was developed by creative agency Ogilvy & Mather. It also featured cricketers Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa. According to Bikram Basu, vice-president, marketing, Seagram India, \"The TVC [television commercial] intends to further strengthen the brand's positioning of \"Make it Large\". The campaign defines the larger than life attitude associated with Royal Stag. It targets the party loving youth of the country, who aspire to make it large in every aspect of their lives and communicates the brand message in a truly fast-paced and international way.\"\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Pernod Ricard India announced that it had signed Shahrukh Khan, for an undisclosed amount, as the brand ambassador for Royal Stag, for a period of one year. The company said that Shahrukh would work in tandem with Saif Ali Khan, who has been the brand ambassador since 2007. In April 2013, social activist T Satish Kumar and student leader Banoth Amru Naik, from the Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh, filed a complaint with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) against Telugu film actor Mahesh Babu for endorsing Royal Stag. The annulment of the agreemenet would result in Sri Lanka Cricket losing its rights to organise matches at the stadium.\n\nIn 2014 Pernod Ricard India announced its signing of Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor as brand ambassadors.

Maitin, a United Breweries technician who oversees all the liquor blends for the company, Royal Challenge is a grain based whisky, blended with Scotch malts and Indian malts. In an article for \"The Wall Street Journal\", reporter Eric Felton states that, \"About 12% of the blend comes from real malt whiskies: some of it made in India, some actual Scotch. The rest of the mix is a neutral spirit distilled from molasses. (It's much easier and cheaper to grow sugar cane than barley in India.) That means that, strictly speaking, Royal Challenge, like most Indian \"whisky\", is actually a rum flavored to pass as whisky.\" The manufacturer has refused to state the percentage of Scotch whisky used in the blend. In the United States, Royal Challenge is referred to as \"spirit whisky\". Besides India, Royal Challenge is sold in several other countries including the Middle East and the United States.\n\nRoyal Challenge was originally manufactured by Shaw Wallace and launched in India in the early 1980s.

In December 2003, Royal Challenge launched a new advertising campaign, \"What's life without Royal Challenge\". The new campaign sought to portray the Royal challenge drinker as a \"young contemporary urban male who exudes relaxed confidence\".

Although it is commonly believed that Oyster ice cream was invented in 1842, this is false; as first lady of the United States Dolley Madison's favorite flavor of ice cream was said to be oyster, and even the pilgrims at Plymouth ate oyster ice cream. Described as having a savoury taste, the ice cream flavour has been offered at a number of oyster festivals.\n\nIt was previously thought that eating oysters and ice cream together would be no good for one's health; some investigators in the 1930s claimed that this belief was unfounded. Oyster ice cream was already in existence as early as 1824, when a recipe for it was given in Mary Randolph's cookbook, \"The Virginia Housewife\". The ice cream was also supposedly the favorite flavor of Dolley Madison, and was eaten at the White House. In the past, when oyster ice cream was first introduced, it was deemed a luxury food that only the \"upper classes\" could indulge in, because ice was scarce and difficult to find back then.\n\nAccording to Spanish-born chef José André, oyster ice cream is made by \"gently heating oysters and cream\", before freezing the product. Robert Brantley, an ice cream researcher, describes oyster ice cream as \"[e]ssentially [...] frozen oyster chowder [...] served [...] unsweetened\". Oyster ice cream is said to have a savory taste, as opposed to a sweet one.\n\nLorraine Eaton of \"The Virginian-Pilot\" wrote that one of her colleagues at work \"had nearly thrown up\" after tasting Eaton's homemade oyster ice cream; others had favorable criticism for the ice cream flavour.\n\nMention of oyster ice cream is made in Mark Twain's novel \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\". The ice cream flavour was well-liked by the author. One tale, though deemed a myth, has it that oyster ice cream was \"George Washington's favorite\".

It is the first single malt whisky to be made in India. \"Amrut\" (अमृत) or \"amrita\" is a Sanskrit word which can be translated as \"nectar of the gods\", \"nectar of life\", or \"drink of the gods\". The company translates it as \"Elixir of Life\". The brand became famous after whisky connoisseur Jim Murray gave it a rating of 82 out of 100 in 2005 and 2010. In 2010 Murray named Amrut Fusion single malt whisky as the third best in the world. John Hansell, editor of American magazine \"Whisky Advocate\", wrote that \"India's Amrut distillery changed the way many think of Indian whisky – that it was, in the past, just cheap Scotch whisky blended with who knows what and sold as Indian whisky. Amrut is making whisky, and it's very good\".\n\nAmrut Distilleries sells Amrut single malt whisky in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nAmrut Distilleries Ltd was founded in Bangalore, Karnataka in 1948 by JN Radhakrishna Rao Jagdale. The company initially manufactured Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), and mainly supplied it to the Canteen Stores Department, as well the states of Karnataka and Kerala. The current main distillery was built in 1987. It is located on a site in Kambipura. Radhakrishna Jagdale's son Neelakanta Rao Jagdale, joined in 1972. Radhakrishna died in 1976, and his son assumed the role of chairman and managing director of the company. The company faced difficulties until the 1990s, as good equipment was not available locally. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \"The alcoholic beverages industry was not a priority in the country. Although we received help to a certain extent from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) Mysore, we had to find our own ways to learn about improved distilling methods\".\n\nIn 1982, Jagdale had decided to create a premium whisky from barley blended with malt, while most distillers in India were manufacturing whisky using molasses. Amrut Distilleries began using locally grown barley, in addition to molasses, and launched Prestige Blended Malt Whisky in the Canteen Stores Department in 1986. The first batch of single malt whisky was ready within 18 months. Because India had no culture of consuming single malt at the time, the company did not consider bottling it as a single malt. Instead, the whisky was blended with alcohol distilled from sugarcane to produce MaQintosh Premium Whisky. Initially, Amrut aged malt whisky for around a year before blending it. However, due to changing customer preferences, less malt whisky was being added into blended variants. The company discovered that hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during ageing, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 11–12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that one year of barrel-ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland. Jagdale felt that \"the taste profiles were much better, almost matching some of the 12-year-old [Scotch] whiskies\". The company then decided to launch their whisky in the European market.\n\nIn 2001, Neelakanta Rao Jagdale asked his son Rakshit Jagdale, who was pursuing an MBA course in Newcastle, England at the time, to investigate the potential of exporting their products to that country. Consultants Tatlock and Thomson Ltd of Scotland were hired to help hone the company's processes at their Bangalore distillery. Amrut Distilleries conducted blind tests of their single malt whisky in Scotland, where most consumers said they liked the drink and compared it to Speyside single malts.\n\nThe whisky, under the brand name Amrut Single Malt Whisky, debuted in Glasgow, Scotland on 24 August 2004. The company faced difficulties convincing European distributors and consumers to try the product, as most believed that a good single malt could not be produced in India. According to head of international operations Ashok Chokalingam, the initial strategy of offering the product in restaurants was dropped, as \"the resources needed are too high, both financial and human\". They switched their focus to retailers and bars. Following the UK launch, the brand spread across Western Europe and the Scandinavian countries within two years. Amrut single malt whisky was launched in South Africa in 2008 and Australia in August 2009.\n\nOn 4 February 2010, Amrut Distilleries held a tasting session in Bangalore to launch their single malt whisky. The brand began retailing in Bangalore the same month. Domestically, it continued to be available only in Karnataka until November 2013 when it was launched in Mumbai. The company went with a Scottish launch for marketing reasons. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \"From a marketing perspective, we thought if our product had to pass the test, why not do so in the toughest location. Scotland is the home of Scotch. If they acknowledge our single malt, then that's good enough for me\". The company also feels that \"the high entry costs and complex excise laws in different states are a deterrent to further expansion in India\". The brand was launched in North America in April 2010. Purple Valley Imports is its distributor in the United States.\n\nAmrut single malt whisky is manufactured at Amrut Distilleries' main distillery located on a site in Kambipura, a village on State Highway 17. The distillery was built in 1987. Amrut single malt whisky is made from barley, and for some variants, peated barley. Barley is procured from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, while the peated barley is imported from Scotland. Peat is a fossil fuel traditionally used in Scotland to dry malted barley before distillation. It imparts a distinct smoky flavor to whisky. Barley strains, cultivated in Haryana and Punjab, produce smaller grains with more flavors. The manufacturing process involves the use of six 10,000-litre stainless steel fermenters, two unique conical 5,000-litre copper Pot stills with copper condensers and new and used ex-Bourbon barrels. The water used in the manufacturing process is transported to the distillery by truck from a well, away, in a pesticide-free agricultural area owned by the company.\n\nMalted barley is mashed with water and put into the stainless steel fermenters, which are water-cooled to prevent their temperature from exceeding , as \"Lactobacillus\" bacterial growth starts at . The fermentation process lasts six days and uses commercial distillers yeast. The fermented wort is then pumped into a 5,000-litre Indian-made semi-conical wash still, where it undergoes slow distillation for 14 hours. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, says that this allows for \"more reflux, more contact time with the copper\". The spirit is then distilled again in Scottish-style, but Indian-made, 5,000-litre copper spirit still with a boil ball. This produces spirit between 68% and 70% abv. If the spirit is diluted to 62.8%, each distillation run makes enough to fill 20 barrels. The whisky is aged in a mix of new oak and used Bourbon barrels imported from the United States. The distillery initially tried importing staves to save money, but abandoned the practice due to the smell of the barrels. It has also used its own rum and brandy barrels to finish its single malts. The Amrut Intermediate Sherry variant is aged in Sherry casks from Spain and Portugal. Amrut Distilleries has a cooperage on site to handle repairs.\n\nThe duration of barrel-ageing for Amrut single malt whisky is much lower than that of Scotch whisky, due to India's hotter climate. The hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that one year of barrel-ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland. The whisky is generally aged for four-and-a-half years, although it may be higher for some variants. Bangalore, where the distillery is located, experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The city is situated at an altitude of 3000 feet above sea level and usually enjoys a moderate climate throughout the year. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 12 °C (54 °F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 34–35 °C (<100 °F). As a result of these conditions, whisky is ready to be bottled after 4–5 years of barrel-ageing. According to Kumar, the whisky starts \"reaching its peak in four years\", after which it has to be tasted regularly because \"by five years it starts to get too much tannin\". The fraction lost to evaporation during aging, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 11–12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. Most of the angel's share is water due to Bangalore's dry climate.\n\nThe company decided against using computers and automation in their distillery in favour of providing more jobs to people. The distillery employs 450 people. Most of the staff at the distillery involved in bottling and packaging are women. The distillery produces 4 million cases of liquor a year, of which about 25% are blended whisky and around 10,000 cases are Amrut single malt.\n\nAmrut single malt whisky is sold in 11 variants. Apart from the ones listed below, Amrut whisky is also sold in the Amrut Indian Single Malt Whisky 46%, Amrut Peated Indian Single Malt Whisky 46%, Amrut Cask Strength, Amrut Peated Indian Single Malt Whisky Cask Strength, Amrut Portonova, Amrut Single Cask and Amrut 100 variants. Amrut Distilleries does not state the age of its single malts on the bottles because the company fears that consumers who do not know about the brand or the faster maturation process in India, would mistake it for a young whisky, and not be willing to pay a higher price.\n\nAmrut Fusion was launched in 2009. It is produced using 25% Scottish peated barley and 75% unpeated Indian barley. According to Neelkanta Jagdale, \"We did not want to pass it off as Scotch whisky, which it isn't. The USP of Fusion was its Indian origin. That is another reason we never seriously considered giving it a foreign name\".\n\nAmrut Intermediate Sherry was launched at Whisky Live Paris on 25 September 2010.. The spirit used in the product is matured in either ex-Bourbon or new casks, and then in Sherry casks imported from Spain and Portugal. According to head of international operations Ashok Chokalingam, \"In our belief, it is not all about the influence of Sherry in the whisky. It is about the balanced profile of the whisky – to see how the Sherry butts can complement the whisky rather than dominating it\".\n\nAmrut Kadhambam is aged in various casks, which each impart unique characteristics to the product. \"Kadambham\" is a Tamil word meaning mixture.\n\nAmrut releases a limited edition of the Two Continents variant, usually every two or three years. The Second Edition used second-fill Bourbon casks and was bottled at 50% abv, while the First Edition was matured in ex-grain casks and bottled 46% abv. The Second Edition of 1,260 was released in October 2011.\n\nAmrut Greedy Angels was a limited edition 50% abv, 8-year-old single malt whisky released in April 2013. Amrut Distilleries claims that it is the oldest Indian whisky ever produced. Its name comes from the term angels' share, the portion of whisky lost during maturation. The eight-year maturation in Bangalore resulted in a high evaporative loss of 12% per annum, or a total loss of 274 litres of spirit over eight years, from the two Bourbon casks the distillery had used. When filled in 2004, the casks held approximately 360 litres of spirit. Only 144 bottles or 86 litres of whisky were released worldwide. Greedy Angels was dedicated to celebrate the 60th birthday of Amrut Distilleries chairman and MD, Neelakanta Jagdale.\n\nAmrut Double Cask was a limited edition of 51 cases released in March 2010.\n\n\n"}

A Tribunal of Inquiry, often simply called a tribunal, is a powerful type of statutory inquiry whose procedures are governed by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 as amended. An Oireachtas inquiry is a less powerful non-statutory inquiry controlled directly by the Oireachtas (parliament). A 2013 proposal to strengthen the power of Oireachtas inquiries was defeated at a referendum. The Law Reform Commission published a report in 2005 examining the operation of public inquiries and recommending changes. A commission of investigation is a different form of inquiry, with evidence generally given in private; provided by the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to address scandals relating to medical care and child abuse.\n\nTribunals have been held to address many political controversies, increasing in frequency since the Beef Tribunal of the early 1990s. While they have been the subject of many dramatic revelations in Irish politics, they have also become known for running long beyond their intended length – the extreme case being the Mahon Tribunal (previously the Flood Tribunal) which began in 1997 and issued its final report in 2013.\n\nThe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 was enacted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland before the setting up of the Irish Free State and as such remains in the Republic of Ireland. It has, however, been amended since by several Acts of the Oireachtas. The chair of the inquiry is mandated by the Oireachtas (following resolutions in both the Dáil and the Seanad) to carry out the inquiry into matters of urgent public importance by a Warrant of Appointment. The terms of reference of the inquiry are given as part of that warrant.\n\nTribunals of Inquiry are established by the Oireachtas where the evidence of malfeasance might not be enough to secure a criminal conviction, but where public policy requires answers. Critics of the system say that tribunals: are relatively toothless; may give witnesses immunity that they would not obtain from a court; allow legal representation to all parties, resulting in a higher final cost to the State than the cost of the original malfeasance; and that they can delay difficult political decisions. The Comptroller and Auditor General published a report in 2008 into the cost of Tribunals of Inquiry and making recommendations. It noted that 50%–85% of the cost of recent tribunals had been legal fees for third parties, as distinct from administration and the tribunal's own legal fees.\n\nTribunals of Inquiry are invested with the powers, privileges and rights of the High Court. It is not a function of a Tribunal to administer justice; their work is solely inquisitorial. Tribunals are required to report their findings to the Oireachtas. They have the power to enforce the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Tribunals may consist of one or more persons, though the practise has been to appoint a Sole Member. Tribunals may sit with or without Assessors (who are not Tribunal members). Sittings are usually held in public but can, at the Tribunal's discretion, be held in private.\n\nNon-tribunal official inquiries, and subsequent reports, include:\n\n"}

Sairme is at an elevation of in a gorge cut by the Tsablaristskali River. Summers are moderately warm with an average July temperature of 17 °C and winters are mild with an average January temperature of –1 °C. Precipitation totals annually. Sairme mineral water is used for drinking and bottling. There is a sanatorium in Sairme.\n\nThe first mention of the waters Sairme was found in the sources of the 1890s. According to popular legends among the people, two brothers - the hunters who were pursuing the trail of a wounded deer found water Sairme. Water flowed over the stones red with oxide and all around it was white with salt. Deer often came here for salt and water. They called the water Sairme because of their number (the origin of the name comes from the Georgian word ირემი, which in translation means \"deer\").\n\nShepherds also paid attention to this area because of the amazing events. They noticed that in a place that was at a distance of about 3 km from the source of deer, grass was steady green, the snows never lie, and the earth was already dry in a few minutes after the rain. The veil of mystery of a magic glade was filmed in the 20th century when geologists discovered hot mineral water in the land.\n\nThe first attempt of a scientific study of water Sairme is associated with the name of Baghdad doctor Kelenjeradze. In 1912 while still a student, he took a sample for analysis to St. Petersburg. The first chemical analysis of mineral water was held by professors of Petersburg Military Academy. They were vividly interested with a sample sent from the possession of Eristavi in Petersburg. In subsequent years Latvian scientist Robert Kuptsis studied the mineral waters Sairme. On the orders of Emperor Nicholas II he studied mineral waters of the Caucasus, particularly Georgia.\n\nThe use of Sairme water began in 1893. Mineral water was mainly poured predominantly in the barn, where it was brought by horses. For the first time they began to pour the water on the factory rules in 1945. In 1954 the construction of the plant was completed. Since that time 400,000 untreated water in liter bottles were released. Later the plant was equipped with a water production system, which changed little by little and become more modernized.\n\nDuring the collapse of the Soviet Union and the introduction of socialist system the work of the plant was stopped.\n\nSince 1998, after the privatization, they began a modernization of the plant and care for the return of the popularity and their consumers; the interior and facade of the building was updated.\n\nSince 2010 there have been significant changes in the factory Sairme: a complete re-inventory was made; a mineral water bottling mechanism has changed; the plant was equipped with automated manufacturing facilities and computer technology. The laboratory was completely renovated and water quality is regularly tested there, the process of casting a bottle is also strictly controlled.\n\nSairme flows in several streams/water well in the resort and nearby territories. They differ from one another in their chemical composition and healing properties.\n\nCurrently two types of water are bottled:· \nThe water is rich in calcium bicarbonate, which strengthens the skeletal system and helps to stop the inflammatory process. Carbonated mineral water is used for restoring the function of the liver, urinary tract, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. It promotes the breakdown of harmful substances formed as a result of metabolism.\n\nSairme Springs – (not carbonated) is used in medical procedures as well as in cosmetology.\n\nThe massive deposits of tufa are located in the field which creates the basis for anticline Sairme. Water mineralization changes from 1.6 g/L (≃ 1.6 oz/cu ft) (borehole in Namarniskhevi at a distance of from the central sources) to 9.5 g/L (≃ 9.5 oz/cu ft) (borehole #4). The output of the spring is variable. This source is also the basis for the operation of the resort Sairme for prophylaxis and a wide range of diseases treatment purposes.\n\n"}

It has subsequently been launched in many other countries. Coca-Cola Life tried to co-exist with Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero in the Argentine and Chilean market, but it has been slowly removed from those markets due to its low reception from customers..

The commercial shows the parents going through common hardships of young parenthood, such as getting little sleep, having a toddler make a mess in the house, etc. Toward the end of the commercial, the father closes his eyes and takes a long drink from a Coca-Cola Life bottle. He opens his eyes, and while still drinking, his wife shows him a \"positive\" pregnancy test result.

Paul John is made from Indian malted barley and, for some variants, imported Scottish peat, distilled in traditional copper pot stills and then matured in Charred American Oak Casks. \n\nPaul John Single Malt Whisky was first launched in the year 2012 in the United Kingdom. Following the overwhelming response & appreciation from Whisky Connoisseurs and Whisky Lovers in the UK, Paul John Single Malt was introduced all across Europe including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Poland, Belgium and Scandinavian countries where Single Malt whiskies are consumed with a passion. Among the non- European markets, Paul John Single Malt Whisky is available in USA, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and India. In India, Paul John Single Malt Whisky was successfully launched initially in Goa in the year 2013 followed by the launch in Bangalore in the year 2015. And now it is available in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chandigarh, Hyderabad ( Telangana ), Chhattisgarh, Daman, Assam, Pondicherry, Karnataka, Kerala markets as well.\n\nJohn Distilleries have aggressive plans to extend the footprint of Paul John Single Malt Whisky in other European markets such as Greece and a few eastern European countries.\n\nJohn Distilleries is based in Bangalore, but its single malt distillery is located in Goa. The distillery has two sets of Indian-made copper pot stills (wash and spirit) that can produce 6000 litres daily. Maturation takes place in a climate-controlled underground cellar that has around 10,000 barrels. The company had been making blended whisky since its foundation in 1996, but decided to manufacture single malt whisky in 2008 in an attempt to enter the premium end of the market. Master distiller Michael D'souza chose to use Indian ingredients in the making of the single malts, to give the whisky characteristics of its country of origin. The wash he created had an abv of 5%, lower than the standard 8% for most whisky. This creates a sweeter flavour in the final product. The whisky is put in the casks at 55% abv, but the alcoholic strength increases as it ages due to the heat, giving the final product an abv of 57%. Goa features a tropical monsoon climate, and being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, with day temperatures of over 35°C (95°F) coupled with high humidity. The monsoon rains arrive by early June and last till late September. Goa has a short winter season between mid-December and February. These months are marked by nights of around 21 °C (68 °F) and days of around 28 °C (84 °F) with moderate amounts of humidity. The hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during aging, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 8-10% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. This leaves a hogshead with only 150 bottles left in it, after three years, compared to around 350 in a Scotland. Michael D'souza describes it this way, \"Whisky matured at these temperatures simply cannot be aged for the kind of time expected with Scotch, even trying to mature our whisky for just 10 years would leave barely a bottle of liquid in the barrel. Fortunately, the heat actually speeds up the maturation process considerably. As a result, whisky that has been matured for just 4-5 years – as is the case with Paul John Edited and Brilliance – is equivalent to a Scotch that has been aged for around 15 years\".\n\nThe first bottling of Paul John whisky, branded \"Paul John Single Cask 161 Whisky\", was officially launched on 4 October 2012 at the Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, England. It was a non-peated whisky single cask whisky, made from Indian malted barley distilled twice in traditional copper pot stills, aged for an unspecified period in first-fill charred American casks. It was bottled at cask strength: 57% abv and 150 bottles were made from the cask. It sold exclusively through the Whisky Exchange priced at £60 for a 700 ml (70 cl) bottle. Whisky connoisseur Jim Murray gave it 94.5 points and the \"Liquid Gold\" award in his Whisky Bible. The brand's second release, also in 2012, was \"Paul John Single Cask 163 Whisky\" having 57% abv and priced at £60. Following the single cask release, Paul John released two single whiskies in May 2013. They were branded Paul John Single Malt Whisky Brilliance and Paul John Single Malt Whisky Edited. The company plans to focus on single malts, while also releasing occasional single casks and are also planning special releases. Presently the flagship expressions of Paul John whisky include Paul John Brilliance, Paul John Edited and Paul John Bold as well as Select Cask Classic and Select Cask Peated. It occasionally releases special editions such as Kanya by Paul John and has released a limited edition, Mars Orbiter, as well. The single malts are now available across 38 countries in the world and have won over 200 prestigious international awards as well.\n\nAs of May 2017, John Distilleries had a malt production capacity of 60,000 liters per month.

Indonesian dictionary describes \"bumbu\" as \"various types of herbs and plants that has pleasant aroma and flavour — such as ginger, turmeric, galangal, nutmeg and pepper — used to enhance the flavour of the food.\"\n\nIt is a characteristic of Indonesian cuisine and its regional variants such as Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Padang, Batak and Manado cuisines. It is used with various meats, seafood and vegetables in stews, soups, barbecue, sotos, gulais, and also as an addition to Indonesian-style instant noodles.\n\nIndonesians have developed original gastronomic themes with lemongrass and galangal, cardamom and chilies, tamarind and turmeric. \n\nUnlike Indian cooking tradition that favoured dried spice powder mix, Indonesian cuisine is more akin to Thai, which favour the use of fresh ingredients. Traditionally, this mixture of spices and other aromatic ingredients are freshly ground into a moist paste using a mortar and pestle. \n\nThe spice mixture is commonly made by slicing, chopping, grinding, beating, bruising, or sometimes burning the spices, using traditional cooking tools such as stone mortar and pestle, or a modern blender or food processor. The bumbu mixture was usually stir fried in hot cooking oil first to release its aroma, prior to adding the main ingredient (meats, poultry, or fish).\n\nThe main function of \"bumbu\" is to add flavour and aroma, but prior to the discovery of refrigeration spices were used as preservatives. Garlic, shallots, ginger and galangal have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives.\n\nKnown throughout the world as the \"Spice Islands\", the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to world cuisine. Spices such as \"pala\" (nutmeg/mace), \"cengkeh\" (clove), \"daun\" \"pandan\" (Pandan leaves), \"kluwek\" (Pangium edule) and \"laos\" (galangal) are native to Indonesia. It is likely that \"lada hitam\" (black pepper), \"kunyit\" (turmeric), \"sereh\" (lemongrass), \"salam koja\" (curry leaf), \"bawang merah\" (shallot), \"kayu manis\" (cinnamon), \"kemiri\" (candlenut), \"ketumbar\" (coriander), \"jahe\" (ginger) and \"asam jawa\" (tamarind) were introduced from India or mainland Southeast Asia, while \"daun bawang\" (scallions) and \"bawang putih\" (garlic) were introduced from China. Those spices from mainland Asia were introduced early, in ancient times, thus they became integral ingredients in Indonesian cuisine. While the New World spices such as chili pepper and tomato were introduced by Portuguese and Spanish traders during the age of exploration in the 16th century. List of spices used in \"bumbu\" are:\n\nIndonesian cuisine also recognize various types of sauces, condiments and seasonings, some are basic seasonings, some are indigenously developed, while another was influenced by Indian, Chinese and European sauces, such as:\n\nRecently there are some additional foreign sauces and seasonings that has been included into Indonesian kitchen and sometimes used as condiment, such as:\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine there are myriad variations of bumbu spice mixture, divided according to each recipes and each regional cuisine traditions.

{"id": "39850424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39850424", "title": "Thalassery cuisine", "text": "Thalassery cuisine\n\nThalassery Cuisine refers to the distinct cuisine from Thalassery town of northern Kerala, that has blended in Arabian, Persian, Indian and European styles of cooking as a result of its long history as a maritime trading post.\nThalassery is known for its biryani (in local dialect, biri-yaa-ni). Unlike other biriyani cuisines Thalassery biryani uses Kaima/Jeerakasala rice instead of the usual basmati rice. The influence of Arabian/Mughal culture is evident, especially in the dishes of the Muslim community, although many have become popular among all communities.\n\nThalassery also occupies a special place in the modern history of Kerala as the pioneer of its bakery industry, since the first bakery was started by Mambally Bapu in 1880 and the western style cakes were introduced in 1883.\n\nThere are broadly two classes of the non-vegetarian cuisine in Kerala; \"Malabar cuisine\" which is from North Kerala and \"Syrian Christian cuisine\" which is from the South (Travancore and Kochi regions). \nThe two are clearly distinct from each other; the former has Mughlai-Arab, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Jewish and French influences and the latter includes a mix of Kerala traditional dishes rich in coconut as well as various recipes of Syrian, Dutch, Portuguese or British origin. \n\nMost dishes of Malabar cuisine, including Thalassery biryani, involve frying in ghee; there are sweet and spicy variants and they are predominantly non-vegetarian.\nSome typical examples include Ari pathiri, Chatti pathiri, Coin porottas, Kallummakaya fry, Arikkadukka and Biryanis with chicken, mutton, prawn, fish, egg as well as Sweeteners such as Aleesa , Kadalapparippu ada and .\n\nBiryani is traditionally seen only as an \"occasional\" serving and not as staple food.\nBreakfast dishes include Pathiri, Orotti etc. The sweeteners are mostly used as snacks to be consumed in the afternoon or early evening.\nBiryani was introduced into the region due to the Islamic influence and the recipe gradually evolved into Thalassery biryani.\n\nThalassery Falooda is a regional variant of the Persian dessert. This is a cocktail of fruit salad, dry fruits such as black current, pista, cashew, almond (badam), rose milk and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe Asian Green Mussel (Perna viridis) cuisines are favored in Thalassery dishes. \nThe mussel is called Kallu-mma-kaya (fruit on the stone) or kadukka. They grow on rocks in contact with the sea. Other dishes include Kallummakaya porichathu (fried mussel), Arikkadukka (Stuffed-in-shell mussel, steamed and fried), Kallumakkaya Ularthiyath or Mussel Stir Fry, Kallumakkaya Varattiyathu, mussel pickles. Elambakka (clams) are also popular. \nThe green mussel's popularity led farmers to employ aquaculture in local rivers to increase supplies. Thalassery natives are known for their generous hospitality towards guests.\n\nAnother Thalassery dish is Kozhi-kkalu, made of sliced and fried tapioca. \nPappadam-Pazham kuzhakkal, Aval um Poriyum kuzhakkal are other popular dishes.\n\nMuttamala, Taripoli, Pazham nirachatu (fried banana filled with grated coconut sugar or jaggery), Unnakaya, Kaayi pola, Chatti pathiri and Ari pathiri are other local dishes. Porridges such as Mutaari kachiyatu (ragi porridge), are popular.\n\nMuttamala and Muttasirka are a traditional sweet made using egg, where Muttamala is yellow noodle-like made of egg yolk and Muttasirka is white-colored and made of egg white. Typically, Muttamala is spread over pieces of Muttasirka, and they are further adorned with cherries.\n\nUnnakkai (ഉന്നക്കായ്‌) also known as Unnakaya, Unnakka, Kaai Ada, and Kaai Porichathu, is a spindle-shaped sweet dessert made of plantains. It is a famous Malabar snack often served at weddings, iftar parties and other festivities.\nIt is prepared by stuffing plantain with flavored coconut (and optionally with egg) and fried in ghee.\n\nChatti pathiri is similar to Lasagne where layers of spiced (masala) beef or chicken mixture are placed between layers of egg dipped pancakes and baked in oven. It is especially served in Malabar Muslim weddings and reception parties.\n\nThalassery biryani () is a rice-based dish blended with spices and chicken. As it is the only biryani recipe in Kerala cuisine, it can also be called \"Kerala biryani\".\n\nThe main difference between Thalassery biryani and other biryanis is that it uses only Khaima/Jeerakasala ricea short-grain, thin rice which is also called biryani rice in Kerala. The dish does not use basmati rice. Biryani is an exotic dish of Mughal origin, but this variant is an indigenous recipe of Malabar. It is a symbol of the cultural amalgamation of Mughal and Malabari cuisines. The Mughals brought the cuisine of biryani from Samarkand, and later variations of biryani developed in different parts of India. Thalassery biryani may have come to the region because of the influence of the Muslim rulers of Mysore and Arkot.\n\nThalassery biryani is a cultural embodiment and is reminiscent of foreign influences in Malabar; it is a reminder of the Mughal-Arab cultural influence in North Kerala due to the trade that lasted for many centuries before the 1900s and the emigration to the Middle East of locals from the 1970s onwards. Thalassery sea port was an export trade centre for spices where a convergence of European, Arab and Malabar cultures occurred.\n\nThe name \"Thalassery biryani\" (, , , , ) originates from Thalassery, a town in the coastal Malabar region in North Kerala, India. The word \"biryani\" is derived from the Persian word \"biryān (n)\" () which means \"fried\" or \"roasted\". Biryani was believed to have been invented in the kitchens of the Mughal Emperors; Thalassery biryani is one of many ways of preparing biryani dishes. In the local dialect-Malayalam, there is a small variation in pronunciation. It is called biri-yaa-ni instead of bir-yani\n\nThalassery biryani is an ample insignia of the Islamic cultural influence in the region. The dish is a traditional Mappila or Malabar cuisine. Ancient written recordsexcept for a few treatise by historiansciting the origin of Mappila's (Malabar Muslims) are rare. The mythology about the conversion of the last Chera Emperor (Cheraman Perumal)Rama Varma Kulasekhara Perumalto Islam from Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur) by Malik Deenar and subsequent conversion of Perumal's sister and nephew residing in Dharmadam(a village located north of Thalassery) is generally believed to be the origin of Islam in North Malabar. Perumal is believed to have left Kerala from an erstwhile feudal province in the region named \"Poyanad\" (Poya Nadu-'The province from where he left') which lies in between Thalassery and Kannur taluks (Governed by local chieftains named Randuthara Achanmar before 1947). Perumal's nephew Mahabali, is believed to be the first Ali Raja of the Arakkal kingdom (The Sultanate of Lakshadweep and Cannanore)the sole Muslim kingdom of Kerala. The Arakkal Kingdom controlled Dharmadam until the formation of Kerala state on 1 November 1956. The legend showcases that these incidents had a significant influence in introducing Islamic culture in Thalassery. In the ancient period ThalasseryAn erstwhile port town in North Malabar was geographically in the convergence point of three regional provinces Chirakkal, Kottayam and Kadathanad. It was also the end point of the 'Perya pass' coming from the eastern hilly areas of Coorg and Wayanad making it an important trade center of spices in Malabar. The Arab traders, the Arkot rulers and the invasion of Sultanate of Mysore were the other important factors which introduced and developed various Islamic culture in the region.\n\nDuring the Muslim holy month of Ramzan, Malabar dishes are made in abundant varieties. The Muslim community of Malabar differs culturally; the lifestyle of the trader communities near the coastal towns differs from that of the farming communities in the inland and hilly areas; Malabar cuisine varies throughout the region. In the modern era as communication improved exponentially, the differences of culture between coastal and hilly area became inconspicuous resulting in the amalgamation of food culture within the Muslim community in Malabar .\n\nThe Mughlai cuisine had a significant influence upon Malabar recipes. Mughali recipes including Biryani, Kebab and Naan spread throughout India. The ingredients included rice, maida, wheat and there was extensive use of ghee (clarified butter) and oils for preparation. Sweet delicacies were made from jaggery (unrefined sugar). Most of these dishes are non-vegetarian; chicken, mutton, lamb and beef are used but pork is not consumed due to religious regulations. Dish range from mild to extremely spicy, and the dishes have distinct aromas.\n\nThe practice in Islamic food culture is that the non-vegetarian dishes are required to be \"Halal\" compliant, such foods are supposed to be consumed by Muslims as a religious directive. The Malabar Mappila dishes are preferred by some societies to be compliant with the 'Halal' method of food processing.\n\nThalassery biryani uses a unique, fragrant, small-grained, thin rice variety named or . This rice even though small in size, is different from the common small rice used in many Indian rice dishes. Kaima/Jeerakasala is not round unlike these common smaller variants and the fragrance of Kaima/Jeerakasala is another distinct feature. Other kinds of rice that could be used are Jeera rice, Jeerakasemba or small Bangladeshi biryani rice. The rice is white, short (small) grained, thin (not plum), but it is the aroma of these rice varieties which make then distinctive. \nThe recipe and cuisine of Thalassery biryani has clear conspicuous differences with other biryani variants. The Kaima/Jeerakasala rice does not need pre-soaking, water is only used to clean the rice. After adequate boiling there should not be any water remaining in the cooking dish as it should have been evaporated completely. This is a major difference from other rice preparation, in which water has to be drained off after cooking.\n\nThe blending of ghee rice with masala is done by the \"dum\" process (A method of cooking by sealing a lid tightly and placing hot charcoal on it). The biryani masala and ghee rice are arranged in layers inside the dish. Meat is cooked with masala on slow fire; it is layered with rice and the lid of the container is sealed with Maida dough or a loin cloth. Hot coal or charcoal is placed then above the lid. Thalassery biryani is a \"Pakki-Biryani\". There are two types of biryani; \"Pakki\" and \"Kacchi\", In Pakki style, the ghee rice is added to the fully cooked chicken-masala mix and then cooked by the \"dum\" process; where as in Kacchi style the ghee rice is added to the half cooked chicken and then cooked till it is fully cooked or the dum process is used.\n\nSpecially dressed chicken is poured into the masala dish. The chicken is slowly cooked in the masala, and gets blended well with the juices of masala and spices. The Thalassery biryani recipe has additional distinct features; unlike other biryanis it is not oily because of the dum process used for preparation. A unique blend of spices is added and the Kaima rice also adds a unique flavour. No oil is used to make the chicken, which is added raw into the masala mix.\nFor the recipe, see \n\n\nCommon side dishes served with Thalassery biryani are Coconut-Mint chammandi (Biryani Chutney), South Asian pickle and Raita. After the meal, hot lime-black tea (known among the Muslim community as 'Sulaimani') is served; this adds a special taste after the main course and is an aid to digestion. Lime tea is a common \"afters\" in the Malabar region, especially with a rice based main-course.\n\nFried Indian anchovy or smelt can be served as a starter if required and this is garnished with chopped onion, curry leaves and lime juice squeezed over it. Fried chicken in smaller pieces is also seen in some fiestas as accompaniments or as starters.\n\nDaahashamani water, a medicated herbal water, is preferred to be used when drinking water with biryani. Daahashamani is an ayurvedic medicine and natural thirst reliever and digestive aid prepared by mixing dry ginger, cardamom, cloves, coriander seeds, mimosa catechu, sapanwood, vetiver, puncturevine and sandal wood, it is usually available in local markets.\n\nThe dish is popular and is often served in Malabar in weddings and other celebrations and parties. Biryani is an unavoidable dish for the Muslim community. Even though Sadya is the traditional cuisine for Hindu weddings in the region, Some Hindus and Christians often serve biryani, mainly because it is easier to prepare than other main course dishes and it is a complete food that avoids the extra effort of making curry.\n\nThe dish is rich in nutrients as it is a rice-spice dish. It is high in proteins and carbohydrates, and is also a source of minerals and vitamins. Nutritional value (According to U.S Dept. of Agriculture) of the spices is mentioned in the notes. The dish contains unsaturated and saturated fats; the saturated fat can be reduced by adjusting the quantities of hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati) and ghee.\n\nThe Malayalam movie, \"Ustad Hotel\" is based on the preparation of Malabar biryani. The film is about a restaurant that specialises in Malabar cuisines that were made without adulteration and according to traditional recipes. The film narrates that customers choose this restaurant for the authenticity of the dishes.\n\nThe fictional restaurant depicted in the film is a prominent destination for food lovers as the cuisine is based on genuine Malabar recipes. The restaurant serves their flagship dish-Thalassery biryani to all customers who reach there for the first time. The story depicts these customers as admiring the dish from the first time itself and whenever they come back to the city they choose this restaurant and order this biryani The story depicts the importance of fiesta in Malabar culture. The choice of making \"the recipe of Malabar biryani\" as a theme for a blockbuster film shows how elegantly the dish is perceived in Malabar region and throughout Kerala.\n\n\n\n"}

It is ground meat, usually pork, wrapped in rice paper and deep-fried.\n\nThe main structure of a roll of \"chả giò\" is commonly seasoned ground meat, mushrooms, and diced vegetables such as carrots, kohlrabi and jicama, rolled up in a sheet of moist rice paper. The roll is then deep fried until the rice paper coat turns crispy and golden brown.\n\nThe ingredients, however, are not fixed. The most commonly used meat is pork, but one can also use crab, shrimp, chicken, and sometimes snails (in northern Vietnam), and tofu (for vegetarian \"chả giò\"- 'chả giò chay'). If diced carrots and jicama are used, the stuffing is a little bit crunchy, matching the crispy fried rice paper, but the juice from these vegetables can cause the rolls to soften after a short time. If the rolls are to be stored for a long time, mashed sweet potato or mung beans may be used instead to keep the rolls crispy. One may also include bean sprouts and rice vermicelli. Eggs and various spices can be added to one's preference. Sometimes, the ingredients can include julienned taro root and carrots if jicama cannot be found. Taro roots give it a fatty and crunchy taste.\n\nChả giò rế is an uncommon kind of \"chả giò\" (nem) that uses \"bánh hỏi\" (thin rice vermicelli woven into a sheet) instead of rice paper. The stuffing inside the roll is the same as normal \"chả giò\", and the roll is also deep fried. The sheets of \"bánh hỏi\" are narrow, and the rice vermicelli strands are brittle, \"chả giò rế\" rolls are often small and difficult to make. They are only seen at large parties and restaurants.\n\nThe most interesting part in \"nem\" recipe is that it varies on different families and also different regions of Vietnam. No recipe is official. It depends on the custom of eating of each family. Therefore,in some ways the \"chả giò\" made by the wives show their cares for their own family.\n\n\"Chả giò\" can be eaten by itself, dipped into \"nước chấm\" or \"nước mắm pha\" (fish sauce mixed with lemon juice or vinegar, water, sugar, garlic and chili pepper), or served with rice vermicelli (in \"bún chả giò\").\nUsually it is served with a dish of \"rau sống\" ( raw vegetable) containing several kinds of vegetable such as lettuce, coriander, etc.\n\nThere can often be confusion as to what exactly is meant by \"nem\" depending on the circumstances. In Vietnam, there can be confusion between northerners and southerners because northerners tend to use the term \"nem\" to refer to a variety of different rice paper rolls containing meat, including \"gỏi cuốn\", which Northerners call \"nem cuốn\" (often referred to in western restaurants as \"salad rolls\"). The southerners, however, tend to adopt a more precise definition of \"nem\", using the word \"nem\" to only refer to ground meat food items like \"nem nướng\" (literally \"grilled sausage\", a minced pork sausage mixed infused with crushed garlic and fish sauce and then grilled).\n\nFurther confusion can occur outside of Vietnam because the English translation of \"chả giò\" varies according to restaurants' menus, \"chả giò\" is often confused with other dishes such as egg rolls or salad rolls. As \"chả giò\" made with rice paper can easily be shattered when fried, and also stay crispy for only a few hours, restaurants outside of Vietnam have adopted wheat flour sheet to make \"chả giò\", in place of rice paper, thus blurring the difference between \"chả giò\" and the Chinese egg roll.\n\n\n"}

There are some variations and depending on the recipe one could also use flour mixed with cream instead of roux, add some bright beer or thickened with egg yolk.\n\nThe famous German poet Theodor Fontane wrote about the Spreewaldsauce: \n„Das wäre kein Spreewaldsmahl, wenn kein Hecht auf dem Tisch stände, und das wäre kein Hecht, wenn ihn nicht die berühmte Spreewaldsauce begleitete, die mir wichtig genug erscheint, um hier das Rezept in seinen äußersten Umrissen folgen zu lassen.

After this \"tripartite garment\" (upper part, belt, lower part) the cake was named.\n\nAs the name derives from the tripartite piece of clothing, it also consists of three parts or layers: the upper layer is made of creamy stirred egg yolk with butter, sugar, vanilla pudding and beaten egg whites which are finally folded into the batter. The middle layer (the \"belt\") consists of a kind of custard which in addition to butter, egg, sugar and milk does also contain quark and vanilla flavouring. The cake base lastly is either a yeast dough or a sponge cake. After these three layers are assembled the cake is baked, then cut into rectangular pieces and served with coffee. \nThe above depicted is the recipe for the traditional Dresdner Eierschecke but there are also some variations and refinements of this recipe, e.g. the addition of raisins, almonds or Streusel or even the coating of the whole cake with chocolate.\n\nAnother variation is the Freiberger Eierschecke, which is much flatter than the Dresdner Eierschecke and contains neither quark nor raisins. It has a very interesting legend which implies that the quark which was originally meant for baking had been used to build the city wall of Freiberg in the 13th century. To compensate for the alleged loss of flavour, more egg, sugar and even for the first time raisins were used.\n\nThe famous German author Erich Kästner once said: \"Die Eierschecke ist eine Kuchensorte, die zum Schaden der Menschheit auf dem Rest des Globus unbekannt geblieben ist.\" \"(The Eierschecke is a type of cake which to the detriment of humanity remained unknown to the rest of the world)\", and Martin Walser says in his book \"Die Verteidigung der Kindheit\" (The defence of the childhood): \"Eierschecke gibt es außerhalb Sachsens nur ersatzweise und innerhalb Sachsens nirgends so gut wie im Toscana.\" \"(There are only substitutes of Eierschecke outside of Saxony and inside it is nowhere better than in the Toscana (referring to the Café Toscana in Dresden))\"\n\n\n\n"}

The dish was first conceived in the late 1990s by street vendors in Mexico. Tostilocos are now commonly sold by street vendors, stadium vendors, and at Mexican juice bars in both Mexico and the Southwestern United States.\n\nThe original Tostilocos were created in Tijuana, Mexico. The original mix contained tortilla chips, cueritos, cucumber, jícama, rueditas (little wheel-shaped pieces of fried flour), Japanese peanuts, lime juice, chamoy, and hot sauce.\n\nThe word tostilocos is a combination of the name of Tostitos-brand tortilla chips and the Spanish word \"loco\", meaning \"crazy\". So the name essentially means \"crazy chips\" or \"crazy Tostitos\".\n\nThe usual way of serving tostilocos is by cutting open a bag of tortilla chips lengthwise and adding chamoy, lemon juice, and if desired, Valentina hot sauce. After this, pigskin is added. Most often cucumber and jicama are the next toppings, but one can add any fruit desired. The finishing touches are Japanese peanuts and tamarind candies. The candies vary. The resulting concoction is eaten with a fork straight out of the bag, which is the original and most common way. However, vendors have also used Styrofoam plates or bowls.\n\nTostilocos is generally a \"no rules\" type of dish, so the ingredients may vary depending on personal taste. Besides the ingredients mentioned above, some vendors also use nacho cheese, shredded cheese, sliced pickled jalapeños, and chopped mango bits. The base chips can be any flavor of tortilla chips. Tostitos brand tortilla chips are the most commonly used (hence the name), but any brand of tortilla chips works equally well. Some vendors also use different kinds of chips, such as Fritos corn chips, Doritos, or hot Cheetos.\n\nOne variation of the Mexican dish comes from the Philippines where they add SPAM or Hot Dogs.\n"}

It was developed by the Borden Company in 1930, and is known today in the dairy industry as the \"rotary milking parlor\".\n\nThe Rotolactor was the first invention for milking a large number of cows using a rotating platform. It was invented by Henry W. Jeffers. The Rotolactor was initially installed in a \"lactorium,\" a building specifically designed for milking cows, in Plainsboro, New Jersey. The rotating mechanical milking machine was first used by the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy and was put into operation on November 13, 1930.\n\nJeffers conceived the idea for the Rotolactor in 1913 as a cost-cutting and labor-saving method for milking a large number of cows. Development of the project was put on hold during World War I. In 1928, the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy was purchased by the Borden Company, and Rotolactor development resumed in earnest. Borden provided $200,000 in 1929 for building the Rotolactor at the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy farm.\n\nThe first line of the Abstract of the 1930 Cow Milking Apparatus (Rotolactor) patent starts: \"The object of this invention is to provide an apparatus whereby an indefinitely large number of cows may be milked successively and largely automatically...\" \n\nThe Rotolactor (\"roto\" + \"lactor\" ium) was a large rotating \"merry-go-round\" style platform for holding 50 cows. The machine brought the cows into position for milking with automatic milking machines. The rotating platform machine was sixty feet in diameter and made one complete revolution about every twelve and a half minutes, which was the time required to prepare and milk each cow.\n\nThe first step for each new cow was receiving a bath. They were bathed with warm water and automatic showers, supplemented by two men using pressure hoses, who \"devote their attention to the cleansing of udders and flanks.\"\n\nThe next operator prepared the udder for the milking. Then the teat-cups of the automatic milking machine were attached to the cow's udder. The cow was then milked for the twelve and a half minutes during the Rotolactor's one-time complete rotation. The teat-cups would then be detached at the end of the twelve and a half minute rotation. The cow would then step off the platform and return to the barn to her stall.\n\nThe milk was drawn by a vacuum to sealed glass containers above the cow's head. It was then transported in pipes to weighing and recording apparatuses. Then it was piped to another room where the milk was cooled and bottled. This was faster and more efficient than the methods previously used. Human hands never touched the milk, and the milk never came into contact with air, which was important to prevent premature spoiling. The Rotolactor could milk the Walker-Gordon dairy's 1,680 cows three times daily. This produced 26,000 quarts of milk.\n\nThe August 1931 issue of the \"American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health\" described the Rotolactor as an advance in cleanliness and hygiene for milk production.\n\nThe Rotolactor and the Walker-Gordon farm in Plainsboro became popular tourist attractions, showcasing the unusual and modernistic features of the dairy. The farm building in Plainsboro containing the Rotolactor had an observation room to accommodate visitors, including large groups of school children.\n\nA 1930 film was titled: \"New Jersey. 'The Rotolactor' - hygiene's latest - automatically washing and milking 50 cows at one time in 12 1/2 minutes - inaugurated by Mr. Thomas Edison.\"\n\nThe Rotolactor was also featured at the 1939 New York World's Fair in the Borden’s exhibit.\n\nThe dairy operation at the Walker-Gordon farm ended on June 18, 1971.\n\nAs of 2013, a working Rotolactor is open to the public as a part of the \"Dairy Adventure\" tour at Fair Oaks Farms in Fair Oaks, Indiana.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2013, Black Dog was reported to be the world's fastest growing Scotch whisky by volume, according to International Wine and Spirits Research (IWSR). The whiskies used in the blend come from Scotland. Black Dog Scotch Whisky sold in India is bottled in Parmori District Nasik in Maharashtra, by importing the undiluted spirits from Scotland, a strategy that avoids the import duties imposed on liquor imports to India that are bottled prior to import. (Import duties may be as high as 150% for liquor bottled prior to import, but only about 30% when bottled in India.) The brand's main competitors outside the Diageo family are Ballantine’s Finest Blended Scotch, 100 Pipers Blended Scotch, both owned by Pernod Ricard and two expressions from the Teachers' family, Teacher’s 50, a premium 12 year old Scotch whisky, blended and matured in Scotland but bottled in India starting August 1997 to celebrate India’s 50 years of independence and Teacher's Highland Cream, both owned by Beam Suntory.\n\nThe Black Dog brand of Scotch Whisky was first blended and bottled in Scotland in 1883 by James MacKinlay, a second generation blender of the Leith-based family of Scotland to meet an order placed by Herbert Musgrave Phipson, owner of Phipson & Co. Wine Merchants from Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He was assisted in this task by Walter Samuel Millard (1864–1952), a 19-year old British employee of Phipson- who was responsible for dispatching the consignment back to India- arriving in 1884. The brand was named Millard Black Dog and legend has it that he named it after his favourite salmon fishing fly, known as the Black Dog.\n\nMcDowell & Co (now known as USL) and United Distillers formed United Distillers India Limited in 1992, creating India's first joint venture in the alcoholic beverages industry. It began bottling operations in Nashik to produce Black Dog for the Indian market.\n\nIn April 2004, it was reported in the media that USL (then named McDowell & Co) was planning to sell Black Dog in Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Black Dog had been sold in Pakistan during the British Raj, prior to the Partition of India. In October the same year, it was reported that McDowell & Co was negotiating with a company in Pakistan to manufacture Black Dog. According to Vijay Rekhi, then managing director of McDowell & Co, and then President of the UB Group's spirits division, \"It will only be a small set-up as just 3 per cent of the Pakistani population is permitted alcohol consumption. But we are looking at the opportunity as we are trying to widen our footprints in the SAARC region.\" Rekhi also stated that bottling was already underway in Sri Lanka and the company was looking to expand to Bangladesh, Malaysia and Myanmar.\n\nBlack Dog Scotch Whisky is available in four variations:\n\nThe Black Dog range of Scotch Whiskies have won gold medals at several spirits competitions including The Monde Selection in 2006 and the World Spirits Awards in 2011 for the Black Dog Aged 12 Years and the Monde Selection, World Spirits Awards and the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 2011 for the Black Dog Aged 18 Years.

Likely introduced to Naples from the northern Italian city of Genoa during the Renaissance, it has since become famous in Campania and forgotten elsewhere.\n\nThe sauce is unusual for the long preparation time used to soften and flavor the onions.\n\nDespite its name, which means \"in the style of Genoa,\" Genovese sauce is a principal pasta sauce of Naples and an important part of its culinary history, having been introduced to the city in the 15th or 16th centuries. The sauce may have been brought by Genovese immigrants or merchants, at a time when Genoa and Naples were two of Italy's most important ports. It could also be referring to its inventor's name, since Genovese is a widespread surname in Campania. Genovese sauce is now unknown beyond Campania.\n\nThe sauce's use of onions may reflect a French influence, and resembles Boeuf à la mode. During the mid 19th century, ‘Salmon in Hollandaise and Genovese sauce’ was served in the Grand Véfour restaurant of the Palais-Royal in Paris as a luxury dish.\n\nGenovese sauce is not to be confused with Pesto from Genoa and Liguria, nor with Salsa Genovese, a red wine and vegetable condiment for fish, nor with the \"sauce génevoise\" from Lake Geneva, again served with fish.\n\nGenovese sauce is prepared by sautéing either beef, veal or pork in a large number of onions, for at least two but as many as ten hours. The onions are typically accompanied by minced carrots and celery in what is sometimes known as a \"mirepoix,\" and the sauce may be additionally seasoned using garlic, marjoram, and either bacon, prosciutto or lard.\n\nThe slow cooking of the onions is especially important for the sauce's flavor, and is facilitated by incremental additions of white wine, stock, or both. The sauce and accompanying pasta can be served with the meat from the sauce or separately, garnished with tomatoes, and topped with Parmesan or provolone cheese.\n\nLarge, cylindrical pasta like rigatoni, ziti or candele are favored because they can hold the rich sauce.\n\n"}

It is a flagship brand of the company and is manufactured at their Bangalore facility. In \"Khoday Distilleries Limited vs. The Scotch Whisky Association and Others\", Peter Warren, an employee of Khoday, told the Supreme Court of India that the brand name Peter Scot was made up using his father's first name, \"Peter\", and his nationality, \"Scot\". Another factor in choosing the name was due to the British explorer, Captain Scott, and his son Peter Scott. Although the name \"Scott\" is spelt with two t's, it is phonetically the same as the word Scot. The brand's main competitors are Pernod Ricard's Blenders Pride and United Spirits Limited's Royal Challenge.\n\nKhoday India Limited (KIL) began producing Peter Scot whisky in May 1968, and registered the trademark in 1974. In 1986, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) moved the Assistant Registrar Trademarks for cancellation of the Peter Scot trademark. The SWA claimed that the name was deceptively similar to 'Scotch', which allegedly lead consumers to believe that the product had a Scottish connection. The Registrar ordered the deletion of the Peter Scot trademark in 1989. However, the decision was reversed several times, until a single-judge bench of the Madras High Court, followed by an identical order from the Division bench of the same Court ruled in favour of the SWA. The Court ruled that \"the adoption of a name which indicates the geographical region even when the goods had no connection with that place, was itself dishonest\". KIL appealed the 12 October 2007 high court order in the Supreme Court, arguing that SWA had knowledge about registration of the trademark as early as September 1974, but had waited for more than 12 years to move the Registrar. On 27 May 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of KIL, allowing it to keep the Peter Scot trademark.\n\nIn its judgment, the Supreme Court considered the tests applied by courts in England, Australia and the United States regarding the deceptive similarity of goods. The Court also referred to a passage in \"Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names\" and ruled that, \"the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation and the customers are generally educated persons which are all matters to be considered\". It also held that \"where the class of buyers is educated and rich, the test to be applied is different where the product would be purchased by the villagers, the illiterate and the poor\". The Court reached the conclusion that the trademark concerned a class of buyers who were expected to know the value of money, the quality and content of Scotch whisky and the difference in the process of manufacture, the place of manufacture and their origin. The judgement also stated that \"the Trademark Registrar as well as the high court failed to apply the consumer's knowledge test to the issue and hence arrived at a wrong conclusion\". The SWA described the Supreme Court verdict as \"inexplicable\". The SWA petition seeking a review of the judgment was dismissed by the Supreme Court in February 2009.\n\nKhoday began exporting Peter Scot to Italy in October 2007.\n\n"}

The colour may range from yellow to light brown.\n\nIn Indonesia, amplang is traditionally associated with Samarinda, the capital city of East Kalimantan, since the amplang cracker home industry has thrived in the city since the 1970s. Traditionally amplang was made from \"ikan pipih\" or \"ikan belida\" (\"Notopterus chitala\"), however since this freshwater fish has become scarce, amplang makers replaced them with \"ikan tenggiri\" (wahoo) or \"gabus\" (snakehead). From Samarinda, the popularity of this savoury fish cracker spread to other cities in the Borneo island, such as Balikpapan, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, and even to neighbouring Sabah in Malaysia.\n\nAmplang is often sought as \"oleh-oleh\" (foodstuff gift or souvenir) by those who visited East Kalimantan. Today, amplang made by home industries in Kalimantan has been widely distributed, available in marketplaces and supermarkets in Indonesian cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and Medan.\n\nAmplang is commonly produced by home industries in Samarinda, East Kalimantan in Indonesia. Other than Samarinda, amplang production centres also can be found in Balikpapan, Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan.\n\nIn neighbouring Malaysia, amplang is also produced in the east coast of Sabah, Malaysia.\n\nToday, the makers of amplang in East Kalimantan produce the snack not only with a fish flavor, but in a variety of flavors such as crab and seaweed. Nevertheless, the original amplang kuku macan remains the most popular.\n\n"}

The bar's owner laid out fixings for patrons, who put sandwiches together.

It was one of the two controversial carnivals of the 1880s and 1890s, the other being the annual masked ball, held in the spring. The carnival was an annual event with different themes. It was held particularly for the students of the four branches of architecture, painting, sculpture, and engraving of the École des Beaux-Arts. It was considered a \"riotous Saturnalia\". The girls accompanying the students for the carnival painted their bodies and wore costumes over them which would eventually come off during the wild revelry. The first ball was held in 1892 in Montmartre. It was modest when compared with later ones, and it was considered a success, though it was immediately put into the hands of organizers.\n\nThe second event was a costume ball held 9 February 1893 at the Moulin Rouge; along with merriment and drinking. Nude models walked about as living paintings and a nude woman was noted to be standing on a table at midnight. A lawsuit arose thereafter. Sarah Brown (née Marie or Marie-Florentine Roger or Royer), who posed as an atelier model, was arrested and fined for nudity after the Bal des Quat'z'Arts carnival in 1893. This led to student rioting in the Latin Quarter. Later, when her whereabouts could not be determined, it was conjectured that she had committed suicide.\n\nStarting in 1900, the theme became singular – ancient – drawing on Greece and Homer. The theme was documented in invitations, programs and posters. The 1913 theme was “The Barbarians”, 1914 was Homer’s Greece, 1920 was “Ancient Egypt”, 1921 was “Carthage”, and 1927 was “The Khmers”. Badges made of tinplate or bronze were made to identify the members of the committee responsible for organising the ball.\n\nMonths were spent in the creation of floats and in the costuming of students and models. The favorite wit of the different ateliers was given the task of painting the banner of the atelier, which was carried at the head of the several corteges. Special instructions were issued to the different ateliers while preparations were in progress, such as this one from the ball of 1899:\n\nThe four different ateliers each created various floats and corteges. Prizes were given for the most successful interpretations. A jury composed of painters and sculptors reviewed the costumes as each person entered the ball. If someone did not achieve the appropriate artistic standard, they were turned away. Tickets were not transferable. It was difficult for someone who was not an enrolled student in one of the four ateliers to enter the ball. The ball featured a procession of moving tableaux. When dawn approached the students formed a huge circle to watch the dancing that began in the morning hours. When the dance ended, there would be a shout, \"Long live the Quat'z' Arts!\" The ball closed at about seven in the morning. It was followed by a procession through the Latin Quarter, finally reaching the Louvre where a general romp would occur. The march would resume over the Pont du Carrousel, until the Théâtre de l'Odéon was reached, where the attendees would disband.\n\nIn 2012 the Bal des Quat'z'Arts was revived on the initiative of Nicolas Bourriaud when director of the École des Beaux-Arts.\n\n\nhttp://www.4zarts.org/\n"}

Often served as a spicy side dish, it is also a popular as an afternoon or evening snack.\n\nGiven that its main ingredients are seasonal vegetables, Singju has many variations. However, there are two main types: Veg (vegetarian) and Non-Veg. \n\nThe veg version of this dish is mainly reserved for ritual occasions where there meat/fish consumption is prohibited.  Non-Veg is the more popular version, and includes the traditional fermented fish, Ngari.\n\nManipur, being one of the most ancient independent kingdoms of South Asia, before becoming a part of India in 1949, has many distinctive local customs and traditions, owing to various influences throughout time. The word \"Singju\" comes from two words - \"\"Manaa-Masing\"\" and \"\"Suba\"\". \"\"Manaa-Masing\"\" means green vegetables and \"\"Suba\"\" means combining. Therefore, in rapid pronunciation the word \"\"Manaa-Masing\"\" drops to \"\"Sing\"\" and the word \"\"Suba\"\" transform to \"\"Ju\"\" for the better pronouncement. As a result, the word, \"Singju\" was born.\n\nSingju is a versatile dish that may be made vegetarian or non-vegetarian. There are two distinct ways to prepare singju.\n\nA veggie singju is mainly served in ritual feasts of the Meitei which are observed at home courtyards or shrine yards, or community complexes. It can be eaten at family homes too, but typically people prefer the non-veg versions in a non-ritual context.\n\nIn this form of the dish, the main ingredients are perilla seeds (\"thoiding\" in Meitei), chanaa powder, salt, chillies and various green leafy vegetables (compatible vegetables are listed below).\n\nA non-veg version of singju is mainly eaten at home, and widely sold in restaurants all over Manipur, and in some other areas of India as well. The tag \"non-veg\" is because of the use of the fermented fish ingredient Ngari. Because of this, it can not be served at ritual feasts of the community, which must be vegetarian.\n\nIn this type, the main ingredients are Ngari (a Manipuri form of fermented fish), salt, chillies and green leafy vegetables (compatible vegetables' list are listed below).\n\nAny vegetable can be used to make singju, but some are more popular than others. \nPopular additions include:\n\n\nMorok Metpa or Ametpa is another singju like dish. \"Morok\" means chilli and \"Metpa/Ametpa\" meaning crush. It is traditionally eaten along with daily meals at home but are not served at rituals. Like singju, it can be prepared in two ways, veg and non-veg, the former is usually eaten during the mourning period until the shraddha ceremony or on days when people skip any type of fish/meat due to religious beliefs. It is usually made by frying red chillies, chives and onions as opposed to the usual steamed or roasted fermented fish and chillies eaten everyday.\n\n"}

Double Seven was launched at the annual trade fair at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi as a gift by the then ruling Janata Party.\n\nIn 1977, the Morarji Desai government asked Coca-Cola to hand over the controlling stake of its Indian operation to Indian investors as per the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. This would have meant that Coca-Cola might have had to share the secret Coca-Cola formula with its Indian partners. Coca-Cola refused and was asked by the government to cease its operations in India.\n\nDeveloped to fill the void left by Coca-Cola, Double Seven was manufactured and marketed by Modern Food Industries, a government-owned company. The formula for the concentrate of Double Seven was developed at Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. Despite government backing, Double Seven could not dominate the Indian soft drinks market. The main competitors to Double Seven were Campa Cola, Thums Up, Duke's, McDowell's Crush and Double Cola. Double Seven also had a Lemon-lime flavoured soft drink known as \"Double Seven Tingle\".\n\nIn 1980, Prime Minister Desai lost the support of parliament and resigned, leading to elections that returned Indira Gandhi to power. Double Seven, which was named after the year in which she lost power, lost further share of market as her government was not interested in supporting a product which reminded them of 1977.

The inlet is wide and deep.\n\nThe South Lake Worth Inlet, at coordinates , is bordered on the north by the town of Manalapan and on the south by the town of Ocean Ridge. Ocean Inlet Park, owned by Palm Beach County, extends from the ocean to the lagoon on the south side of the inlet, and covers .\n\nIn the mid-19th century Lake Worth Lagoon was a fresh water lake with no connection to the ocean. After the Lake Worth Inlet was cut near the north end of the lagoon in 1866 (with intermittent closures and re-openings until 1886), the lagoon became increasingly brackish. Development around the lagoon polluted it, as well. By 1913 residents of the area were discussing opening another inlet from the south end of the lagoon to help flush polluted waters into the ocean. The State of Florida created a taxing district for the South Lake Worth Inlet in 1915 (the taxing district was abolished in 1996, and Palm Beach County assumed responsibility for maintaining the inlet). Construction of the inlet began in 1925. The new inlet was completed in 1927 at a cost of $225,000, and was wide and deep (below mean low water).\n\nAs happens generally to inlets on the Florida east coast, the predominantly southward longshore drift caused sand to accumulate against the north jetty of the inlet, and eventually spill over into the inlet and into the Lake Worth Lagoon. The same process also caused erosion of the beach south of the inlet. The height of the inlet jetties was raised, and, in 1937, a sand transfer plant (the first such plant anywhere) was installed on the north jetty to pump sand past the inlet. The transfer plant pumped an average of sand past the inlet in the next five years. The transfer plant was shut down during World War II due to fuel shortages, and sand again accumulated in the inlet and the lagoon. Following World War II, sand transfer was resumed, and dredging of the accumulated shoals in the inlet and the lagoon began. In 1967 the south jetty was extended and a curved extension was added to the north jetty. The sand transfer plant was upgraded in 1948, 1967 and 1998, and rebuilt in 2011.\n\nState Road A1A crosses the inlet on a fixed-span bridge above the water. The depth of the inlet is between and . The inlet was never intended for navigation, but is used by recreational boaters. The inlet has a reputation of being dangerous due to shoaling, strong currents and close clearances. There were more than 46,000 boat trips through the inlet in 2006. Seven boats required rescue in the inlet that year. \n"}

{"id": "40749661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40749661", "title": "Lhakar", "text": "Lhakar\n\nLhakar (Standard 'white Wednesday' or 'pure dedication') is the self-reliance Tibetan movement which appeared after the Tibet uprising against Chinese rule. The movement is based on a non violence strategy, applied through social, cultural, and economical activities.\n\nThe Lhakar movement stems from disagreements on the historic, cultural and political status of Tibet, as either an independent country, or as an integral part of the country of China. In 1950, a Chinese military invasion led by Mao Zedong invaded and subsequently took control of Tibet. Since then Tibet has officially been under the Chinese government and Tibetans are classified as one of China’s 56 recognized ethnic groups.\nHowever tensions between China and Tibet have gradually increased since that period as groups within Tibet wish to be independent from China. These tensions took form through rebellious acts. During the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s Tibet’s struggle for independence took the form of armed resistance. Then, from the 1980s,resistance was transformed into a non-violent, clergy-led protest, until 2008, where a new type of resistance took place, street protests.\nIndeed, after the Tibet uprising in spring 2008 the Chinese authorities increased their military presence in that region. In response to China’s military enforcement, the Tibetans have adapted their forms of resistance, hence the birth of the Lhakar movement.\nInspired by nonviolent methods, such as Mahatma Gandhi’s, the Lhakar movement has been encouraging the affirmation of Tibetan cultural identity, and this has been visible predominantly from 2008 to the present. Since then, Tibetans have been doing things such as wearing traditional clothes, or speaking Tibetan language. Beginning as a campaign to take simple and practical actions on Wednesdays (the Dalai Lama's soul day), to assert Tibetan cultural identity has evolved into a widespread non-cooperation and self-reliance movement inside Tibet. A growing number of Tibetans are eating only in Tibetan restaurants and boycotting Chinese businesses on Wednesdays. Lhakar makes use of low-risked, sustainable socio-economic activities to try to initiate change.\nOn November 6, 2010, in Dharamshala approximately 50 monks and nuns started protests in order to demand Chinese respect toward freedom of the Tibetan language. However, it was mainly on November 9, 2010, in Dharamshala, that this protest expanded- around 700 Tibetan monks and nuns, the majority being from Sershul Monastery, were a part of this. They were then stopped by security forces in the Tibetan region of Zachukha during their march towards Sershul. The purpose of this long march was, according to the protesters, to demand ‘freedom, ‘equality’ and more importantly ‘freedom of language’.\n\nThese protests were triggered by the event of Chinese authorities confiscating boxes containing money from voluntary fine operations that had taken place among the Tibetan population. Those were completed as an act of punishment for those who spoke Drak kay, which is a mix of the Chinese and Tibetan languages. Chinese authorities were against this; however, with the protests for the return of those boxes, the punitive practice was discontinued by the Chinese authorities.\n\nLhakar's strategy is based on nonviolence. That strategy is applied along three main lines: De-collectivization, weaponization of culture, and non cooperation.\n\nIn their fight for human rights and independence, Tibetans have routinely used the most visible form of resistance also known as streets demonstrations. In response to attempts by China to stamp out what they consider as general public disorder, Tibetans adopted a strategy of de-collectivization.\nIndeed, through personal actions such as wearing traditional clothes, eating Tibetan food, listening to Tibetan radio, teaching their native language at home, many Tibetans began to use their individual space to assert a cultural identity that they consider to have been suppressed for decades. In a politically charged period, cultural rituals became political actions, because they gave Tibetan people a non Chinese identity. Emphasizing individual acts of resistance rather than public acts of protest, Lhakar has decentralized the resistance. Through de-collectivization of activism, Lhakar wishes to sustain the Tibetan struggle by empowering the individual.\n\nDisempowering usual perceptions of culture, Lhakar started to use art, literature, poetry and music as a tool to gain greater political rights. They are using aspects of traditional Tibetan culture, such as expressing their faith in the Dalai Lama, and love of their homeland. Songs with politically charged lyrics or music videos with images of the Dalai Lama became more widely circulated and known. This upsurge in the public consumption of Tibetan music and poetry has spawned a modern renaissance in art and literature across the plateau. I has been asserted that through these activities, Tibetans are rediscovering \"how culture can save politics, instead of politics to save culture\". \n\nThe Lhakar movement is encouraging the revival of public enthusiasm for studying Tibetan.\nIn various parts of Tibet, elders and children take pledges to speak pure Tibetan, shedding Chinese terms from their vocabulary. Their pledge is as follows:\n<poem>\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will speak pure Tibetan in my family.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will speak pure Tibetan whenever I meet a Tibetan.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will remind myself every day that I am a Tibetan till I die.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will wear only Tibetan traditional dress, chuba, every Wednesday.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will speak only Tibetan every Wednesday.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will learn Tibetan language.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will stop eating meat and only eat a vegetarian diet and gain more merit every Wednesday.\"\n\"I am Tibetan, from today I will only use Tibetan and speak Tibetan when I call or send a message to Tibetans.\"\n</poem>\n\nIn Sertha in Kham, elders hand out free dictionaries to youngsters. Writers and musicians in eastern Tibet, many of whom preferred the dominant Chinese language as their artistic medium, now compose and perform in Tibetan. In restaurants and cafes, the owners serve customers only when they order in Tibetan. Weibo users tweet in Tibetan every Wednesday; Renren and Facebook users regularly post images and poems that carry political messages. Social networks contribute to spreading knowledge about Lhakar\nAlso, the Dalai Lama is one of the creators of The Lhakar Diaries, a blog and Facebook group that chronicles a group of young Tibetans' quest for culture reckoning as they pledge to participate in Lhakar and record their experiences.\n\nNon cooperation refers to an undeclared and peaceful boycott that Tibetans have used towards Chinese businesses and institutions. This action is inspired by Gandhi's non cooperation actions during the Indian struggle for independence.\nMarkham.\nAnother case of non violent and non cooperative action happened in Markham (in eastern Tibet), where Tibetans consider to have won an unprecedented victory in their fight for civil rights.\nThe residents of Markham petitioned and protested against Zhongkhai co’s company, claiming that mining operation caused a big loss in the area : poisoning of the local water, deterioration(yaks and sheep began losing their hooves), and death (humans and cattle). Considering the petition unsuccessful, they organized on May 16, 2009, a sitting down. Approximately 500 Tibetans linked arms and sat down blockading the only access road to the mining site. Chinese authorities sent up the police to clear up the situation. They asked the Tibetans to move, announcing they would shoot those who wouldn’t disperse. Eventually nothing happened to the Tibetans. On June 8, 2009 the Chinese authorities agreed to cease the mining operation of the company.\n\nNo losar. \nIn 2009, many Tibetans inside and outside Tibet refused to celebrate Losar (the Tibetan new year). Instead they choose a commemorative silence for those killed during the Tibet uprising. Tibetans refused to enjoy and to take part in the celebrations. In some areas (Amdo and Kham), a privately circulated leaflet said :\n\"“During the incidents on March 10, thousands of fellow Tibetans were arrested and sent to prison, thousands of fellow Tibetans suffered from persecution, thousands of fellow Tibetans disappeared; we Tibetans living our quiet and simple lives, if you have a conscience, if you want to live a life sharing joy and sorrows, then we ask you to do the following two things: don’t indulge in singing and enjoyment; don’t light firecrackers or fireworks. Hopefully everyone will be able to follow these two requests, helping us to commemorate the dead and pray for the living!”\"\nAnother leaflet content for No Losar stated: \n\"“Brothers and sisters, monks and ordinary people of the three Tibetan provinces (Amdo, U-Tsang and Kham) of the same root and family, we have to unite, resist together, never ever give in to those invading our homeland. The people of the three provinces must stand together through thick and thin, never forget the fellow compatriots that have been shot dead, they did not die for their own benefits but because they fought for freedom and justice. Thus, as Tibetans, we cannot celebrate Losar…”\"\nThe local authorities saw the 'No Losar' movement as act of severe separatism and proceeded to make arrests of people considered to be involved. Also, they tried to maintain the celebrations with diverse means, for example by making Tibetans sign papers on which were attested they would not refuse to take part in celebrations for Losar. Despite these measures, since 2009 the movement was repeated annually, including in 2013 when a silent commemoration was held.\n\nTibetan Poetry: This Year, No Losar\nBy Chad med sha\nTranslated by High Peaks Pure Earth\n<poem>\n\"\"Last year was washed by blood,In Lhasa, countless compatriots,were fallen under a piercing arrow\"\"\n\"\"this year, no Losar for us,In Sichuan, countless people,buried under the earth\"\"\n\"\"This year, no Losar for us , there is only the word “no” on your lips.We are speechless\",\"\n\"\"You are filled with anger, we have no bitterness.For the sake of the deceased valiant heroes\"\"\n\"\"Let us offer our regrets.For the deceased people, Let us make offerings.\"\"\n\"\"Therefore, This year,how can Losar be celebrated?Unequivocally!

You have not tread the modern path,\"\n\"\"Mind is filled with sadness and suffering,therefore, because of our anguish,\"\"\n\"\"Let’s not partake in Losar this year.\"\"\n</poem>\n\nThe vegetable shops.\nThe boycott of the vegetable shops seems to be what represent the most the non-cooperation tactic in the lhakar movement.\nFor many years, Tibetans in Nangchen (Chinese: Nangqen) had been buying vegetables at what they considered as astronomical prices from Chinese grocers. In early 2011, a group of Tibetans started to boycott Chinese vegetable shops, since they stopped buying vegetables in Chinese groceries. Many Tibetans, followed the example, leading Chinese groceries to closure. Another consequence observed was the development of Tibetan vegetables sellers.\n\nMore\n\nIn Nangchen country, Tibetans have taken diverse Lhakar Pledges resolving to boycott Made-in-China products, Chinese stores and institutions. In some Tibetan restaurants in Zorge, Sichuan province, the orders are only taken in the Tibetan language. Monks in Sershul Monastery, Sichuan province, seeking to protect their mother tongue, prohibit the use of the Chinese language by fining one yuan for every Chinese word said.\n \nFrom the point of view of its proponents, the Lhakar movement is perceived as a threat by the Chinese authorities. Indeed, given that they would not have control over the actions relating to that movement, they have been subject to accusations of intensified repression inside Tibet, especially on non violent actions. For example, in Sershul (eastern Tibet ) a Tibetan woman was arrested for wearing the chuba ( traditional Tibetan dress) on a Wednesday. Also, Tibetans were detained for participating in a preserving language group and others for having promoted vegetarianism - ( see Buddhist vegetarianism ).\nHowever, Tibetan people feel like such actions will not succeed in stopping Lhakar, as Lhakar is a concept.\n\"\" The essence of Lhakar is not in the chuba one wears but in the intention with which one wears it. The real Lhakar is a movement of the mind, and therefore invisible and untouchable to any number of troops, tanks, or bullets. \"\" Tenzin Dorjee said.\nMoreover,they believe such reactions from China will strengthen the movement:\n\"\"China's heavy-handed crackdown on people speaking Tibetan, wearing certain clothes, or going vegetarian – a reflection of its declining confidence and growing insecurity – will backfire on the regime and end up strengthening Lhakar in the long run.\"\" Tenzin Dorjee added.\n\nChabdak Lhamo Kyab\n\"Main article:\" \nChabdak Lhamo Kyab is a popular Tibetan language professor, deputy of Tibetan's Parliament in Exile, as well as writer and poet. He is also a member of the Tibetan Writers Abroad PEN Centre. Known for his support of Tibetan independence, he has been involved in Tibetan politics since a young age: publishing at least seven works on Tibet, as well as poetry. In June 2012, he gave a conference on the Lhakar movement.\n\nTenzin Dorjee\nTenzin Dorjee is a writer, activist and musician. He is the Executive Director of Students for a Free Tibet, a global grassroots network of students and activists. He is also known for his blog posts on the official Lhakar website, and for being the chair of the Lhakar Awards Committee.\n\nAccording to China, Tibet has never been recognised as an independent state by any government of any country. However the remarkable achievement of social and economic progress by Tibet since the peaceful liberation (1951), the purpose of the “Tibetan people’s uprising movement” is to create crisis in China by “staging co-ordinated sabotage activities”) including self-immolation (more than 130 since 2008) and boycotts. They consider the Dalai Lama as the leader of this movement involving his Dalai clique. China’s government feels disappointed in assuring that western media outlets are based on “distorted facts and unfounded claims” and are also ignorant of the obvious truths.\n\nIn order to promote the Lhakar movement in exile, there are several external groups supporting the movement. These include the group Students for a Free Tibet.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, Tibetans and supporters from New York City joined a flash mob in New York's famous Grand Central Terminal to highlight the staggering number of self-immolations: 107 in total, in protest against Chinese rule. Groups of students, monks, children, businessmen, and activists recently arrived from protesting in Beijing, and ex-political prisoners froze in place mimicking the pose of the iconic Olympic athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith who shocked the world with their stance of solidarity during the 1968 Olympic Games.\n\nShortly after the group entered Grand Central Terminal, members of the Tibetan community of New York City and New Jersey dropped a banner reading “One World One Dream Free Tibet” off the two adjacent staircases looking over the Terminal.\n\nThe right of Tibet to be Tibetan was a dominant theme of the European wing of the international Solidarity with Tibet Day, held in early March 2013. Several members of the Flemish Voorpost nationalist organization took a prominent part in the demonstration in Brussels, and were accompanied by nationalists from several other European nations on the day. There were also demonstrations in Copenhagen, Prague, Helsinki, Deggendorf, Berlin, Paris, Hamburg, Budapest, Dublin, Warsaw, Lublin, Lisbon, Bucharest, London, and Edinburgh. The international demonstration was created after the March 1959 crushing of the Tibetan independence movement by the Communist regime in China. The demonstration demanded that the legitimate head of state of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, be returned to his position; that Tibet be given self-determination and that there be respect for human rights and religious freedom in that country.\n\nOn June 24–28, 2013, a pledge to protect the cultural heritage of Lhasa was introduced. Over 100,000 people across the world had signed the Save Lhasa petition, urging UNESCO's World Heritage Committee to protect Tibet's capital Lhasa and its cultural heritage, from Chinese construction activities.\n\nProtests also took place outside UNESCO offices in France, New York and New Delhi, demanding UNESCO's World Heritage Committee to include Lhasa in the World Heritage in Danger List. But UNESCO is yet to take any action. Until they meet those demands, pressure is still on.\n\nLeaders of the G20 countries met in Russia on September 5 and 6, 2013, to discuss international financial and economic issues. To Lhakar, it represented an opportunity to highlight the self-immolation protests in Tibet, and also to persuade the group of world leaders to unite for Tibet. On the eve of the G20 summit, Tibetan NGOs urged G20 leaders to also tackle Xi Jinping about his party's 60-year occupation of Tibet and human rights abuses.\n"}

Old French \"jambon\" is attested since the 13th century and is derived from Old French \"jambe\" (\"gambe\" in Old North French) which in turn is derived from the Late Latin \"gamba\", meaning 'leg/hock of a horse/animal', which can ultimately be traced to Greek \"kampe\" meaning 'a bending/a joint'.

The etymological root of \"grace\" is the Latin word \"gratia\" from \"gratus\", meaning pleasing. Gracefulness has been described by reference to its being aesthetically pleasing. For example, Edmund Burke wrote:\n\nThe difficulty in defining exactly what constitutes gracefulness is described in this analysis of Henri Bergson's use of the term:\n\nGracefulness is often referenced by simile, with people often being described as being \"as graceful as a swan\", or \"as graceful as a ballerina\". The concept of gracefulness is applied both to movement, and to inanimate objects. For example, certain trees are commonly referred to as being \"graceful\", such as the \"Betula albosinensis\", \"Prunus × yedoensis\" (Yoshino cherry), and \"Areca catechu\" (betel-nut palm).\n\nGracefulness is sometimes confused with gracility, or slenderness, although the latter word is derived from a different root, the Latin adjective \"gracilis\" (masculine or feminine), or \"gracile\" (neuter) which in either form means slender, and when transferred for example to discourse, takes the sense of \"without ornament\", \"simple\", or various similar connotations. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary remarks of gracility, for example: \"Recently misused (through association with grace) for Gracefully slender.\" This misuse is unfortunate at least, because the terms \"gracile\" and \"grace\" are completely unrelated: the etymological root of \"grace\" is the Latin word \"gratia\" from \"gratus\", meaning pleasing and nothing to do with slenderness or thinness.\n\n"}

It is often served as dessert or snack, for supper, for tea time, anytime of the day; however, it is a popular choice for breakfast for those who prefer sweet treat instead of its savory counterpart bubur ayam.\nIt is sometimes referred to simply as \"ketan hitam\" or \"pulut hitam\", meaning \"black glutinous rice\", while \"bubur\" means porridge in Indonesian and Malay. In most parts of Indonesia, glutinous rice is called \"ketan\", while in Malaysia and also Sumatra in Indonesia, it is called \"pulut\". Slightly different names may be used in different regions of Indonesia, such as \"ketan item\" in Javanese areas, and \"bubuh injin\" or \"bubuh injun\" in Bali. Other than porridge, black glutinous rice is also can be made into fermented delicacies called tapai.\n\nThe most basic variant of bubur ketan hitam only consists of black glutinous rice porridge sweetened with palm sugar. While coconut milk, pandan leaves and a pinch of salt might be added to give aroma. However, in most part of Indonesia, bubur ketan hitam is always served with \"kacang hijau\" (mung beans), and accompanied with bread. This black glutinous rice and mung beans combo is often simply called as bubur kacang hijau. Sometimes, a more fancy restaurant's variant is served with additional toppings, such as slices of baked or fried banana, or cinnamon powder.\n\n"}

{"id": "40977498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40977498", "title": "Snake soup", "text": "Snake soup\n\nSnake soup () is a popular Cantonese delicacy and health supplement in Hong Kong, which contains the meats of at least two types of snakes as the main ingredients. The soup tastes slightly sweet because of the addition of chrysanthemum leaves and spices, while the snake meat in the soup is said to resemble the texture and taste of chicken meat.\nSnake soup is usually served in specialised stores known as \"Snake King\" or \"Shea Wang\" (literal meaning: an expert in cooking snakes), mostly located in Shum Shui Po and Kowloon City, in fall or winter season for approximately $60 HKD ($7.75 USD) per bowl.\nOriginated centuries ago during the Era of Warring States, snake soup has been lauded in Chinese culture for its alleged medicinal benefits and high nutritional value. However, there are concerns in recent years that the snake soup industry in Hong Kong is on the decline because soup makers have few people to pass on their skills.\n\nSnake soup has been considered a delicacy in Chinese culture for over two thousand years. Pre-Qin's Shanhaijing recorded that inhabitants in Guangdong province started to consume snake soups; and the eating culture was widely popularised in China at the end of Qing Dynasty. Snake soup was regarded as a “high-status” dish because of its varied ingredients and complicated preparation, it was the symbol of wealth, bravery and respect; and was only served to certain officials and celebrities.\n\n“Snake King Lam” was the first store specialising in selling snake soup in Hong Kong, which was set up on Bonham Street 110 years ago, but has relocated to Hillier Street in the same district. The snake-soup industry reached its golden period in the 1980s when there were over 100 eateries that prepared snake soup. Some stores in Hong Kong even had to open new branches to cope with the high demand.\n\nNowadays, the number of stores specialising in snake-soup has dropped down to 20 because of food price inflation and soaring rent. More importantly, it is also difficult for snake-soup makers to find successors. Fewer people enter the profession because of perceived hardship, danger and difficulty involved in the process, which requires frequent contact with venomous snakes. Moreover, severe supply problems caused by bureaucracy involved in snake importation are matched by the erratic pattern of demand from customers.\n\nTypical snake soup recipe calls for at least two types of snakes whose flesh is shredded into thread-like wires, boiled with chicken, pork bone, lean meat, fish maw, fungus, ginger, lemon leaves and other spices for flavour. The mixture is stewed for over six hours to turn into a thick soup, seasoned with salt pepper and dark soy to taste. Most importantly, a thickener, typically corn starch or water caltrop paste, is added, making it a thick soup (\"羹\") with a transparent appearance, rather than broth (\"湯\"). More elaborate snake soup preparations involve additional ingredients such as pork chops, and herbs and spices, including star anise. \n\nThe breed of snake used in cooking varies from place to place but water snake and python snake are popular choices. Chinese cobra, Banded krait, Indo-Chinese Rat Snake, Tri-rope beauty snake and Hundred-pace viper are commonly used in snake soups. At many restaurants that serve snake soups, customers are able to choose, according to their preference, live snakes to be prepared.\n\nSnake meat is light pink in color. On a par with fish, snake meat tastes much richer and is chewier than the former.\nRamy Inocencio of CNN describes that \"Minced dark mushrooms, finely julienned chicken, fragrant chopped ginger and other herbs and spices fill out the recipe, making for a hearty broth. It tastes like chicken too – though a tad tougher.\"\n\nTraditionally, the snake soup is served with very thinly-shredded lemon leaves and chrysanthemum flowers to dilute the saltiness. Nowadays, it is usually served with an addition of pepper, vinegar and thin fried doughs to enrich its flavour and texture. While eating with crab claw chrysanthemums is proposed as the best choice. However, due to the limited supply of crab claw chrysanthemums, it is replaced by boltonia.\n\nIt is believed in old Chinese medical books that snake soup has a number of medicinal benefits, including the cure of bodily ailments, blood nourishment, improvement of skin quality and increase in one's qi or energy levels. It is also widely believed among the Chinese people that snake soup is a \"warming\" food, which heats up the body (or gives it yang which can balance the \"cooling\" yin during the winter season.\n"}

Commonly confused with the snow cone, the ice of a sno-ball is fine and fluffy; while a snow cone's ice is coarse, crunchy, and granular. Moreover, in a snow cone the flavored syrup sinks to the bottom of the cup; while in a sno-ball the ice absorbs the syrup.\n\nSno-balls are a seasonal treat as they are generally sold only from roughly March to October, but Sno-La Snowballs is open year round. They are vended from \"sno-ball stands\" throughout New Orleans and in other parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nBefore the 1930s ice was manually scraped from a block of ice, producing a coarser, crunchier version of the sno-ball. In 1933, Ernest Hansen began work on an ice-shaving machine; and by 1934, he had invented the first motor-driven ice-shaving machine. For two years, Hansen kept the machine within his family, making sno-balls for only his children and relatives. In 1936, Ernest and his wife Mary took their machine to the streets of New Orleans and opened Hansen's Sno-Bliz. The business ran discontinuously for the following two years because Mary needed to care for her children. In 1939, they opened the shop and remained in business for the next 67 years.\n\nBy this time, grocer George Ortolano had invented his own ice-shaving machine, which he later called the Sno-Wizard. Ortolano redeveloped his wooden machine into one made of galvanized metal after he began receiving requests from people who wanted to use his machine to start their own businesses. Soon thereafter, he drew up blueprints for his machine and set his product into automated production. Ortolano's Sno-Wizards are now the primary sno-ball machines used in Louisiana and throughout the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe following list contains many of the sno-ball flavors available at sno-ball stands around New Orleans.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41043381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41043381", "title": "Batak cuisine", "text": "Batak cuisine\n\nBatak cuisine is the cuisine and cooking traditions of Batak ethnic groups, predominantly found in North Sumatra region, Indonesia. Batak cuisine is part of Indonesian cuisine, and compared to other Sumatran cuisine traditions, it is more indigenously preserved. One characteristic of Batak cuisine its preference to andaliman (\"Zanthoxylum acanthopodium\") as the main spice. That is why andaliman in Indonesia sometimes dubbed as \"Batak pepper\".\n\nBatak people are majority Christian — unlike neighboring Muslim-majority ethnic groups such as Aceh and Minang — Batak people are not restricted to Islamic halal dietary law. Many of the Batak's best meals are made of pork as well as dishes made from unusual ingredients, such as dog meat or blood, however there are also halal batak dishes, mostly chicken and freshwater fishes.\n\nBatak culinary centers are located in towns of Batak highlands, such as the town of Kabanjahe and Berastagi in Tanah Karo area. While some towns around the Lake Toba offers freshwater fish dishes such as carp arsik. The North Sumatran capital of Medan is also a Batak cuisine hotspot where numerous of \"Lapo\" (Batak eating establishments) can be found, yet the city is also a culinary center of halal Malay Deli as well as Chinese Indonesian cuisines. Outside its traditional lands in North Sumatra, Batak cuisine can also be found in \"Lapo\" in Jakarta, as well as most of the Indonesian major cities.\n\nCooking traditions in many parts of Sumatra often demonstrates foreign culinary influences; such as Minang, Malay and Aceh cuisines featuring typical curry-like dishes heavily influenced by Indian and Arabic cuisines. Batak cuisine however, retain its indigenous Austronesian cooking traditions; such as cooking meats (especially pork) along with its blood. Similar dish can also be found in Filipino cuisine, such as dinuguan. However, since many tribes of the archipelago have converted to Islam, the non-halal dishes such as those using pork, dog meat, or blood, has been abandoned, and now only survive in non-Muslim areas, such as Batak lands.\n\nRegional differences between Batak and Acehnese culinary influences, among others, are characterized by the choice of spices; curry leaves or andaliman. Coastal Acehnese people using curry leaves (\"Murraya koenigii\") as the main spice, while the Batak people prefer andaliman. Regions that use andaliman as main spices starting from the Gayo highlands in Central Aceh continue to the southeast up to Berastagi in Tanah Karo in North Sumatra.\n\nThe most widely used spice in Batak cuisine is andaliman and \"batak onion\" (chives), they are commonly used for all types of arsik. The most common Batak spicy sauce is called arsik — it is a Batak sauce made from the mixture of andaliman, turmeric, garlic and candlenut. There are many unique spices used in Batak cuisine recipes. Sambal Tuktuk for example use a mixture of andaliman and other spices. Other spices commonly used in Batak cuisine includes kaffir lime, Indonesian bay leaves, coriander, onion, garlic, chili pepper, pepper, lemongrass, ginger, galangal and turmeric.\n\nFor many centuries Batak tribes has led a relatively isolated way of life and maintained their ancestral belief systems. As the result a lot of the indigenous elements of their culture still survive, including their culinary arts. Today majority of Batak tribes are Christian, for example Batak Toba, Karo, and Pakpak. Pork and dog meats are commonly consumed. Dog meat is usually called B1, derived from \"biang\", Batak word to refer a dog, while pork is often called B2 from \"babi\". Pork (B2) or dog meat (B1) are usually cooked in its own blood, spiced and seasoned as saksang, or grilled as panggang.\n\nHowever, there is also Muslim Batak tribes, such as Mandailing Batak tribe. They apply Islamic dietary law which only allows halal food and forbid consumption of pork, dog meat, and blood.\n\nPopular Batak pork dish are saksang, fried cutlets sauteed pork in thick spicy blood sauces and \"Babi Panggang Karo\" (karo roast pork) — often shortened to BPK — which is locals' favourite and has become nationally famous through \"Lapo\" Batak restaurants nationwide. BPK consists of roasted pork slices with three accompaniments: a bowl of broth made from the essence of boiled pig’s bones, a platter of porcine blood cooked with pepper and chili, and a saucer of extra-hot chili sauce.\n\nAnother common meat consumed in the Batak cuisine is buffalo meat, beef and chicken. Manuk Napinadar is a grilled chicken smothered in chicken blood itself, spiced with andaliman and garlic powder. Ayam Tasak Telu is one of popular chicken dish in Batak cuisine. \"Tasak telu\" literally means “cooking three times,” and consists of three dishes: the first part is boiled chicken< the second part is a sauce made of finely-ground corn kernels, spices and the remaining stock from the boiled chicken, the third part is an assortment of chopped vegetables and spicy coconut.\n\nSince the Batak tribes live in the interior of North Sumatra, freshwater fish that live in rivers or Lake Toba is commonly consumed by locals. Carp usually cooked as Arsik or Dengke Mas na Niura, the fish is not cooked, but just seasoned and flavored in heavy spices. In addition to carp, catfish and tilapia are also consumed, usually cooked as Na Tinombur.\n\nBatak dishes sometimes use unusual meats such as dog meat (B1 or \"biang\" ) cooked as saksang or roasted as panggang.\n\nOne unusual notorious dish is Pagitpagit that has distinctly pungent aroma. The ingredients include a brew of cassava leaves, \"santan\" (coconut milk), \"rimbang\" (a bitter but non-toxic variety of the nightshade family), flowers of some locally-available plants and some arsik sauce, pork or beef meat, mixed with additional unusual substance — juice from a cow’s cud, food that has been digested and regurgitated.\n\nAnother exotic and rare ingredients is \"kidu\". It is the Karo word for white, plump grubs or insect larvae found in sugar palm trees. The kidu-kidu sausages are named as such because they look similar to the grubs. The grubs are lightly fried to make the outer skin crispy while keeping the inner part juicy, and then briefly cooked in a boiling arsik sauce.\n\nFor the Batak community, \"tuak\" (palm liquor) is not just for drinking binges. The beverage is mandatory at celebrations, and drinking \"tuak\" has become something of a tradition. It is a popular traditional alcoholic beverage made from palm wine. It is made by fermenting the \"enau\" sap. Batak \"Lapo Tuak\" is a drinking establishment dedicated to serve this traditional alcoholic beverage. North Sumatra is also known as coffee production area in Indonesia. Coffee variants such as Mandheling is those coffee beans grown in North Sumatran Mandailing region.\n\n\n"}

It is claimed to be the first and only carbonated energy drink to have been created, branded and manufactured in Scotland, which is contested with IrnBru32 which was released in 2006 by A.G. Barr. Released in August 2012, the drink is a creation of Ross Gourlay, a Scottish entrepreneur from Bishopbriggs. Gourlay hoped to gain a slice of the growing caffeinated drinks market and also encourage recognisable Scottish brands within the UK. There are two main flavours: Blue Raspberry and Red Blueberry.\n\nThe can design includes the words \"Nae Danger\", a popular Strathclyde phrase equivalent to the Australian \"no worries\", spanning the length of the can. The can also states that it's \"an energy drink like nae other\" and \"it's only a quid\", endorsing the Scottish theme of the product. The company is a new addition to the energy drink market which is worth over £790 million in the UK having risen 17% between 2012 and 2013. The drink competes with other highly caffeinated energy products such as Relentless, Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull. Nae Danger has culminated an assortment of 6 drinks since its released in mid-2012.\n\nThe product name was initially brought up by Ross Gourlay while joking with friends. However, Gourlay had seen the potential in such a product name and believed he could compete with the market leaders, while entering the Scottish market through a quirky brand name. The saying \"Nae Danger\" is a commonly known south-western Scottish regional dialect for \"No Problem\" and this features on the can as well as other phrases such as \"Aye.. Ye Cannae Whack It\". The drink prides itself on being \"only a quid\", meaning that every can is £1 to purchase. Gourlay, who is now head of Nae Danger was a marketing director of a food and drink wholesaler Glencrest Ltd.\n\nNae Danger comes in 4 different flavours. The original flavours were Blue Raspberry and Red Blueberry and these came in 500ml cans. The company then went on to create an original energy drink which conforms to traditional energy drink flavour. There was also a \"Nae Sugar\" (No Sugar) version of Blue Raspberry released which had the same flavour as the standard Blue Raspberry. The company then went on to release two sports drinks, again with the flavour Blue Raspberry and a new addition of Orange.\n\nIn July 2013, they launched a SHY & DRS brand can of 'Original Energy' which featured a free download of their hit single \"Relapse\".\n\nAll Nae Danger drink products have bright, vibrant packaging with distinct flavours. These flavours are distinguishable via the can/bottle colours. The drink itself is coloured and the colour corresponds to the flavour of the can. Blue Raspberry is a light blue colour and Red Blueberry is a pink-red colour.\n\nThe ingredients of Nae Danger include: carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, flavouring; caffeine, taurine, colour E133. Most Nae Danger energy drink products contain a high caffeine content (32 mg/100ml), therefore the packaging contains text describing that the product is not suitable for children, pregnant women or those sensitive to caffeine.\n\nNae Danger mainly advertises through social media and promotional campaigns in Universities. As well as this, they backed up their marketing with radio advertisement and new media work campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. This is mostly where they interact with fans of the drink, as well as advertising their product and events. Nae Danger also sponsor talented Scots to market their product. The fields that they sponsor range from go-karting, skiing and skateboarding. They also sponsor Fiona Wallace who races in the Mini Super Cup which is a small racing competition held in Britain. This event is a feature race at British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) events. The company sponsored the 2013 National Skiathon organised by Disability Snowsport UK that aims to provide facilities for those with disabilities to be able to enjoy Snow sports.\n\nThe products are mainly aimed at the Scottish market, however the company branched out of Scotland with a release of the product in English retail outlets in Yorkshire, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and even London through Nisa Local stores. Stores and outlets that stock Nae Danger in Scotland include Spar who began stocking the product in 2012 and Aldi who is the most recent addition to Nae Danger stockists. Aldi started stocking the product in its stores as of mid-October 2013, other stockists are lesser known convenience stores throughout Scotland such as Semichem and Keystore. The cans themselves are distributed by Glencrest Ltd, Gourlay's former company.\n\nNae Danger came to an agreement with Spar to stock their products in 2012. Ross Gourlay described the deal as a \"major coup\" for the brand as this was the first serious deal for his company. Spar own 12,500 stores worldwide mostly within Europe. A deal with Scottish Spar has meant that 15,000 cans were supplied to shops across the country. Nae Danger had already sold over half a million cans through independent retailers in only a few short months before they struck a deal with a major retailer.\n\n"}

That company has changed its name and its business is unrelated to the original. The brands were bought by Halewood International Ltd and are presently best known for ginger beers manufactured at Halewood's plant in Liverpool. John Crabbie & Company (Wines) Limited was incorporated in May 2006 and changed its name to John Crabbie & Company Limited the following July. \n\nCrabbie's traces its founding to 1801 when Miller Crabbie was a merchant in Edinburgh. The business was inherited by his son John Crabbie (1806 – 1891) who went on to found John Crabbie & Co. \n\nIn the mid-19th century, John Crabbie acquired a former porter brewery located between Yardheads and Great Junction Street in Edinburgh's port of Leith. Over the ensuing years the premises were extended mainly to provide bonded warehouses for Crabbie's whisky business. The company was also engaged in gin rectifying and the production of fruit-based cordials. Of these, Crabbie's was best known for its green ginger wine which was continued to be made in Leith until the 1980s when John Crabbie & Co was acquired by another Leith distiller and blender, Macdonald & Muir, and production of green ginger wine was transferred to Broxburn, West Lothian. Macdonald & Muir had acquired the Glenmorangie Distillery in 1918 and renamed itself The Glenmorangie Company in 1996. In 2007, it sold the brand to the present owners, Halewood International. Preserving its links with Leith, John Crabbie & Company Limited is in the present day a dormant company with a company address in Mitchell Street, Leith. However, production of Crabbie's ginger beer takes place in Liverpool, England.\nCrabbie's alcoholic ginger beer is 4.0% alcohol by volume. It is a carbonated beverage but is not brewed. It is based on a ginger steep, which takes up to six weeks to produce, and contains four secret ingredients. Crabbie’s is typically served over ice or chilled.\n\nSince 2011 Crabbie's has been distributed in Australia through Woolworths Liquor, Beer Wine Spirits and Dan Murphy's grocery stores. In 2012, Crabbie's began distribution in the United States through St. Killian company\n\nIn the UK, Crabbie's is available in flavours such as Original, Scottish Raspberry, IPA and Stout, with a Spiced Orange variant also available in the United States. Outside of the UK and the United States, other variations might be found in speciality shops. \n\nIn the United States, Crabbie's is sold as a malt beverage, and is not gluten free. The discovery that the American version of Crabbie's is not gluten free caused much alarm and controversy among the celiac and gluten intolerant community as Crabbie's was originally marketed as gluten free in the United States. In the UK, it is a gluten free product. \n\nCrabbie's is a sponsor of both international and grassroots rugby, with sponsorships of Wales & Scotland, and Rugby Union clubs Ospreys, Newport Dragons, Scarlets, Cardiff Blues, Edinburgh Rugby, Glasgow Warriors, Newcastle Falcons, Northampton Saints, Yorkshire Carnegie, Richmond, Esher, Caldy, Southport and Rugby League club St Helens.\n\nCrabbies are the headline sponsor for Bournemouth 7s Festival who are the World's Largest Sports and Music Festival taking place with over 400 teams in the last bank holiday weekend in May. \nCrabbie's was the official sponsor of the Grand National Festival from 2013-2016.\n\nScottish football club Hibernian has also been sponsored by Crabbie's.\n\n"}

The term \"liston\" refers to the long marble slabs used for paving the streets. The term \"far el liston\", means \"to walk around the square\".\n\nSeveral cities in the Veneto have a \"liston\".\nIn Venice it is the name of the walk from St. Mark's Square past the columns of Marco and Todaro.\nIn Verona it is the west side of Piazza Bra.\nIn Padua it is part of the Prato della Valle.\nIn Belluno the \"liston\" is in Martyrs' Square (also known as the \"Campedel\").\nIn Rovigo it is the central part of the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. \nIn Trieste, which has strong ties with Venetian culture, it is called the \"Corso Italia\".\nIn the Greek island of Corfu the locals still use the word to indicate the main promenade of Corfu city.\n\nIn Venice the Campo Santo Stefano was a grass area for many centuries, apart from the stone \"liston\". This was the place where Venetians would stroll and meet, and the term for \"take a walk\" in the Venetian dialect is still \"andare al liston\".\nLater the term \"liston\" was used for the Piazza San Marco, described as \"the general \"rendezvous\" of the promenaders and ... the fashionable lounge of Venice\".\n\nWriting of 18th century Venice, Giovanni Rossi (1776–1852) describes the \"liston\" in the fashionable area near the San Stefano Church. During the carnival young nobles strutted there like peacocks wearing tabàro capes and the \"most civilized mask\", the baùta. \nAlthough the common people could walk there, according to Rossi, \"their education was such that commoners left the nobles their space in liberty.\"\nGiacomo Favretto depicted \"El Liston\" in 1884, showing figures in elegant costumes walking and meeting in the heart of Venice.\n\nMartyrs' Square (, also known as Campedel) in Belluno, is called the \"living room\" of the city.\nThe square is just outside the walls of the old city. Some historians claim that shape of the north side of the square was defined by the radius of guns defending the former walls of the city, to the south, which no longer exist.\nThe axis of the square is defined by the \"liston\", a long promenade. According to tradition, the quaint paved \"liston\" was made when the city was under the rule of the Venetian Republic.\nAs of 2011 plans to redevelop the square were being considered, retaining the historic \"liston\" but removing the road that runs along the southern margin.\n\nIn Padua, historically, the \"liston\" was the stretch of Prato della Valle on the west side, opposite the Loggia Amulea, paved with trachyte in the first half of the 19th century by the architect Giuseppe Jappelli. Typically on Saturdays and on other occasions the walk was used for lively outdoor markets.\n\nIn recent years the term \"Liston\" has come to be extended to the central Via Umberto I, Via Roma, Via Cavour and Via VIII Febbraio, after the pedestrianization of the area between the mid-1980s and the year 2000. This has entered the common language of newspapers and local TV stations, even if technically incorrect. However the term applies well to these roads, since the creation of the pedestrian zone has effectively created a single long walk from Prato della Valle to Piazza Garibaldi.\n\nIn Rovigo there is a \"liston\" in both the squares of the historic center, the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II and the Piazza Garibaldi. \nThe second runs along the old boundaries of the Church of Santa Giustina, demolished in 1809.\n\nIn Verona the \"liston\" is the wide sidewalk that borders the Piazza Bra on the west side, curving around the Arena. The piazza is a popular place for both tourists and local people to promenade. The \"liston\" is now used for outdoor seating by the many cafés surrounding the piazza.\n\nFerrara has a \"liston\" next to the Cathedral in the ancient \"Piazza delle Erbe\", now called the \"Piazza Trento & Trieste\". \nAlthough Ferrara is part of the Emilia region, it has many Venetian aspects and is considered a bridge between the Emilian and Venetian culture.\n\nThe \"Liston\" in Corfu, with arcaded terraces and fashionable cafes, was built in 1807 by the French imperial commissioner Mathieu de Lesseps. It is an excellent example of architecture from Napoleonic period, when Corfu was part of the First French Empire. The design was inspired by the Rue de Rivoli, Paris.\nBrewster Chamberlin celebrated it in his 2005 poem \"Along the Liston, Corfu\", describing the \"Liston\" as a crowded, relaxed place to sit and snack and watch the promenaders.\nThe \"liston\" runs along one side of the Spianáda, part town square and part park. At one time it was a firing range for Venetian troops. \nNow it holds a cricket pitch, a British innovation that is regularly used by local teams.\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

Offenders who committed crimes on religious holidays like Christmas were given harsher punishments. Today it is a tradition to recommend that people behave in a respectful and peaceful manner at Christmas. The Declaration of Christmas Peace has remained in Finland where it is an essential part of the Christmas tradition.\n\nDeclaration of Christmas Peace is announced in several Finnish cities on Christmas Eve. The oldest and most popular event is held at noon at the Old Great Square of the former Finnish capital Turku where the declaration has been read since the 1320s. The most significant exceptions to this are thought to be the years of the Greater Wrath when Finland was under Russian occupation which lasted from 1712 to 1721, and the single years missed during both the 1917 militia strike and the Winter War year of 1939. There may also have been a break between 1800 and 1815.\n\nThe Turku declaration has been broadcast by the Finnish Broadcasting Company since 1935. National television broadcasts started in 1983 and the Turku declaration has also been seen on the Swedish television since 1986. The event can be viewed via the internet as well. Besides Turku, the declaration is also announced in some of the oldest Finnish towns like Rauma, Porvoo, Pori and the Estonian city of Tartu.\n\nMusic has been a part of the event since the 17th century. Traditional instruments used include the bagpipes, timpanis and various string instruments. The current format was established in 1903. It starts with the hymn \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\" and is followed by the declaration which is announced by a city official at midday. As the declaration is read in Finnish and Swedish, the public sings the \"Finnish national anthem\" in both languages afterward. The event ends with \"March of the Men of Pori\" which is usually played by a local military band, usually from the Finnish Navy.\n\nThe present version of the Turku declaration was written down in 1827.

An infectious disease (ID) specialist's practice may consist largely of managing nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, or it may be out-patient based.\n\nID specialists typically serve as consultants to other physicians in cases of complex infections, and often manage patients with HIV/AIDS and other forms of Immunodeficiency. Although many common infections are treated by physicians without formal expertise in ID, the ID specialist may be consulted for cases where an infection is difficult to diagnose. They may also be asked to help determine the cause of a fever of unknown origin. \n\nID specialists can practice both in hospitals (inpatient) and clinics (outpatient). In hospitals, ID specialists help ensure the timely diagnosis and treatment of acute infections by recommending the appropriate diagnostic tests to identify the source of the infection and by recommending the appropriate antibiotic to treat the infection. For certain types of infections, involvement of an ID specialists may improve patient outcomes. In clinic, ID specialists can provide long-term care to patients with chronic infections such as HIV.\n\nID is historically associated with travel medicine and tropical medicine, as many diseases acquired in tropical and subtropical areas are infectious in nature.\n\nID specialists employ a variety of diagnostic tests to help identify the pathogen that is causing an infection. Common tests include Gram staining, blood cultures, serological tests, genotyping, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nID specialists employ a variety of antimicrobial agents to help treat infections. The type of agent used depends on the organism that is causing the infection. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections; antiviral agents treat viral infections; and antifungal agents treat fungal infections.\n\nIn the United States, ID is a subspecialty of internal medicine or pediatrics (i.e., an internist or pediatrician trains for an additional 2 years as a medical fellow to qualify as an ID specialist and sit for the ID boards).\n\n"}

{"id": "41366808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41366808", "title": "Windpost", "text": "Windpost\n\nA windpost is a structural item used in the design and construction of masonry walls to increase lateral wall stability and protect them against damage from horizontal forces imposed by wind pressure, crowd or handrail loads. They are normally constructed from mild steel channel sections, supported at the head and the foot between floor slab levels and/or the principal steelwork sections forming the structural frame of the building. In cavity walls, the windpost will typically be fixed into the inner and outer leafs of the wall by specialist fixings and fastenings at regular intervals along its length. The windposts will be spaced along the walls of the building at regular intervals as calculated by the engineer to suit the required loadings. \n\nIn most cases a windpost is a large and very unwieldy element that can often weigh in excess of 400kg. The manufacture and delivery of both steel and concrete windposts has a significant carbon footprint and once delivered to site, their storage requires large areas to be set aside. The procurement of windposts, including the design process, often requires a lead time of four to five weeks. The length and weight of windposts makes them particularly difficult to manoeuvre into position in confined spaces. When installed as part of an internal wall, significant health and safety risks exist for the installers in lifting the windpost to its vertical position. There is no recognised mechanical lifting method to safely erect windposts.\n\nThe properties of steel windposts have inherent fire integrity, acoustic, air tightness and thermal movement issues, all of which require additional measures to achieve specification compliance at extra cost.\n\nAs an alternative to steel windposts, when the primary structure is composed of reinforced concrete, secondary structures are cast in situ to provide lateral support to masonry panels.\n\nRecently, a new innovative technique of reinforcing blockwork walls has been developed and used in many Crossrail projects in the UK. It consists in using uniquely designed hollow blocks to allow the construction of reinforced concrete beams and columns within the blockwork construction, which eliminate the need for traditional windposts or lintels. \nThis new technique maximises masonry wall strength without thickening the wall or harming its appearance and allows the architects to design and create uninterrupted blockwork panels with flexible detailing options, whilst retaining the performance characteristics of traditional masonry such as fire integrity, acoustic performance and air permeability. This modular approach also provides the adaptability for contractors to make late changes to construction without affecting the build programme and creates seamless walls which do not require any fire protection. \n"}

Today's Vietnamese water puppetry is a unique variation on the ancient Asian puppet tradition.\n\nThe puppets are made out of wood and then lacquered. The shows are performed in a waist-deep pool. A large bamboo rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by the puppeteers, who are normally hidden behind a screen, to control them. Thus the puppets appear to be moving over the water. When the rice fields would flood, the villagers would entertain each other using this form of puppet play.\n\nModern water puppetry is performed in a pool of water 4 meters square with the water surface being the stage. Performance today occurs on one of three venues—on traditional ponds in villages where a staging area has been set up, on portable tanks built for traveling performers, or in a specialized building where a pool stage has been constructed.\n\nUp to 8 puppeteers stand behind a split-bamboo screen, decorated to resemble a temple facade, and control the puppets using long bamboo rods and string mechanism hidden beneath the water surface. The puppets are carved out of wood and often weigh up to 15 kg.\n\nRice, the main staple of the Vietnamese diet, grows in a water paddy. The original water puppet festivals were literally held inside a rice paddy, with a pagoda built on top to hide the puppeteers who stand in the waist-deep water. The water acts as the stage for the puppets, and as a symbolic link to the rice harvest. It also hides the puppet strings and puppeteer movements, improves the musical and vocal acoustics, and provides a shimmering lighting effect.\n\nA traditional Vietnamese orchestra provides background music accompaniment. The instrumentation includes vocals, drums, wooden bells, cymbals, horns, Đàn bầu (monochord), gongs, and bamboo flutes. The bamboo flute's clear, simple notes may accompany royalty while the drums and cymbals may loudly announce a fire-breathing dragon's entrance.\n\nSingers of chèo (a form of opera originating in north Vietnam) sing songs which tell the story being acted out by the puppets. The musicians and the puppets interact during performance; the musicians may yell a word of warning to a puppet in danger or a word of encouragement to a puppet in need.\n\nThe puppets enter from either side of the stage, or emerge from the murky depths of the water.\n\nSpotlights and colorful flags adorn the stage and create a festive atmosphere.\n\nThe theme of the skits is rural and has a strong reference to Vietnamese folklore. It tells of day-to-day living in rural Vietnam and Vietnamese folk tales that are told by grandparents to their grandchildren. Stories of the harvest, of fishing and of festivals are highlighted.\n\nLegends and national history are also told through short skits. Many of the skits, especially those involving the tales of day-to-day living, often have a humorous twist.\n\nChú Tễu (\"chú\" means uncle, man, boy or Mr. in Vietnamese) is a recurrent and the most notable character in water puppetry. Tễu means \"laugh\" in ancient Vietnamese. He is a jester who provides witty comments on political and social realities, especially officials' corruption. His appearance is of a smiling boy who often wears nothing but a simple loincloth, sometimes accompanied by a simple open vest.\n"}

Born/borne in German also means fount, or spring, and is related to the Indo-European root, *bhreu.

Just Mayo was first released in Northern California Whole Foods Markets on September 19, 2013. Just Mayo comes in original, wasabi, truffle, sesame ginger, garlic, chipotle and sriracha flavors. It has been described as \"a vegan spread that has rattled the egg industry.\"\n\nJust Mayo was formulated in 2011 by Josh Tetrick. He started the business after investing $37,000 of his own money to find a cheaper alternative to eggs. The company he began operating under was named Hampton Creek, renamed to JUST, inc. in 2017. Individuals such as Bill Gates and Li Ka-shing backed the company because of its quest to find an egg-free food solution that's cheaper, healthier and more humane.\n\nJust Mayo does not contain eggs and the formula took approximately two years to create. The research and development team at Hampton Creek screened 1,500 plants before discovering eleven that were suitable for the emulsification purposes in a mayonnaise. The plant that replaces the egg in Just Mayo is a specific variety of the Canadian yellow field pea (a type of split pea).\n\nIn October 2013, Just Mayo was produced by a copacker located in Seattle and Tennessee and distributed to Whole Foods across the United States by distribution company United Natural Foods.\n\nIn October 2014, Just Mayo was available in about six grocery store chains in the United States, including Whole Foods, Kroger, Safeway, ShopRite, Target and Costco.\n\nOn October 31, 2014, Unilever (parent company of competing brand Hellmann's/Best Foods) filed a lawsuit against Hampton Creek for false advertising, arguing that Just Mayo cannot be marketed as mayonnaise because it does not meet the definition of the product specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA requires that \"mayonnaise\" contain 65% vegetable oil and at least one egg yolk-containing ingredient; Just Mayo contains ingredients such as pea protein, beta-carotene, and modified food starch, none of which are used in mayonnaise according to FDA standards. Unilever also noted the use of egg-oriented imagery in its promotional materials, and stated that its false claims were \"part of a larger campaign and pattern of unfair competition by Hampton Creek to falsely promote Just Mayo spread as tasting better than, and being superior to, Best Foods and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\" Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick denied any wrongdoing, believing that Unilever's lawsuit was meant to solely hinder competition.\n\nOn December 18, 2014, Unilever dropped the lawsuit so Hampton Creek could work with \"industry groups and appropriate regulatory authorities\" on resolving its labelling, while also complimenting the company for its \"commitment to innovation and its inspired corporate purpose.\" In August 2015, the FDA sent Hampton Creek a formal warning that Just Mayo's labeling was misleading due to the product not meeting the standards for \"mayonnaise\", and because of wording on the packaging and promotional materials that contained an \"implied health claim that these products can reduce the risk of heart disease due to the absence of cholesterol,\" which cannot be included as it contains too much fat to be promoted with such statements.\n\nIn December 2015, Hampton Creek announced that it had agreed to revise its packaging for Just Mayo in order to comply with the FDA's recommendations. The new label contains more prominent statements surrounding the nature of the product, and contains an explanation that the word \"Just\" in the product's name is defined as being \"guided by reason, justice, and fairness.\"\n\nIn October 2016, it was reported that the American Egg Board and its affiliates \"launched a secret two-year war against the vegan mayonnaise competitor\", spending at least 59,500 to counter publicity about Just Mayo's products. This led to a federal investigation by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, which condemned the American Egg Board \"for overstepping its congressional mandate.\"\n"}

Earliest references to DeArmond's tremolo unit date to 1941. Starting in the 1950s many companies began incorporating the effect into guitar amplifiers, including the Fender Tremolux and Vibrolux: Leo Fender marked the effect on Fender amplifiers as \"vibrato\", conversely calling the vibrato arm on his Fender Stratocaster a tremolo arm. The most notable early amplifiers with built-in tremolo functions were the 1961 Fender Princeton and the Gibson Falcon. In such amplifiers, the tremolo circuit was relatively simple, using as little as a dozen components and one half of a tube of the preamp circuit. The effect was achieved through \"bias wiggle\", in which the bias of a tube, in the preamp or output stage, was modulated (turned off and on, or partly off and on) in a pure sine wave. Such circuits typically had controls for speed and depth, and produced an effect described as \"lush, warm, and roundly pulsing\".\n\nLater amplifiers, and particularly the Fender Blackface amps of the mid 1960s and the later Silverface amps, used a much more complex circuit, producing the kind of effect that was especially popular with surf musicians. Modulation was produced using an optocoupler, a light-dependent resistor whose pulsating signal (producing a lopsided wave) affects the preamp circuit.\n"}

It is typically an expensive dish, due to the rarity of tiger penis. In some cultures and countries, people believe that the dish can enhance male virility—a notion that has not been supported by scientific evidence. There has been opposition to the dish from environmental organizations, and ongoing consumption of the soup has contributed to the decline of tiger populations. The legality of the dish varies in different countries, as tigers are a protected species.\n\nPreparation involves soaking dried tiger penis in water and then cooking it along with other medicines and spices. Sometimes tiger bone is also included in the soup's preparation. Tiger penis soup has been sold for US$300 a bowl in China and other places in the Orient, and can cost as much as US$400. In 1998 in Southeast Asian and East Asian markets, the soup sold for US$350 per bowl. Prices are expensive due to the rarity of tiger penis. The dish is available and has been consumed in many Chinatowns throughout the world.\n\nSome people and cultures in Asia believe that tiger penis soup acts as a medicinal aphrodisiac, can improve one's sexual performance or virility, or cure impotence. However, consumption of cooked animal genitalia does not increase testosterone levels in humans. Furthermore, there is no empirical evidence of tiger penis being correlated with sexual enhancement in humans. It has been stated that men may be fooled into thinking their sexual prowess is increased by consuming tiger penis soup due to placebo effects, in which the placebo effects act to counteract mild impotence, rather than the soup.\n\nIn 1996, the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organization that focuses upon wildlife conservation, ran an international advertising campaign stating that claims of sexual potency being enhanced from consuming tiger penis soup are fraudulent. It has been stated that beliefs of tiger penis soup contributing to sexual enhancement has contributed to the endangerment of tiger populations, because of tiger poaching that occurs due to the high prices penises and other animal parts can command. Additionally, a high demand for tiger penis soup has significantly contributed to reductions in tiger populations.\n\nTigers are an endangered, protected species. It is illegal in some countries to consume tiger, and it has been stated that consumption of tiger is unethical due to the animal's endangered status. Consumption of tiger in the United States is illegal, but 60 percent of shops in New York City's Chinatown stated that they carry tiger parts in a circa 2010 survey. Some shops in New York City's Chinatown may sell deer or ox tendons, defrauding consumers by claiming that they're tiger penis.

This was in response to a Spanish colonial decree establishing the distribution of Spanish family names among the inhabitants of the Philippines who did not already have a surname.\n\nSpanish Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa issued a decree on November 21, 1849. Following the Christianization of the Philippines, many Filipinos chose surnames. The surname is very common in the Province of Capiz, in the Island of Panay. The town of \"Pan-ay,\" from which the island derives its name, was the second Spanish settlement in the Philippines when conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legaspi left Cebu for Manila. He settled in the banks of the Pan-ay river and built a pueblo. Following Christianization, surnames of the local inhabitants were changed to Spanish surnames. Intermarriage between the Spaniards and locals brought for a new class of local mestizos, thus the Buenvenida family is as old as the town itself.

It is made by cooking berries, other fruits, or more rarely nuts, vegetables, or flowers, in sugar syrup. In some traditional recipes, other sweeteners such as honey or treacle are used instead of or in addition to sugar.\n\nVarenye is similar to jam except the fruits are not macerated, and no gelling agent is added. It is characterized by a thick but transparent syrup having the natural colour of the fruits.\n\nThe making of varenye requires a careful balance between cooking, or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough time to allow the flavor to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit, and cooking too long that fruit will break down and liquefy. Some fruits with tough skins require cooking for many hours, while others are suitable for making \"five-minute varenye\" (, \"varenye-pyatiminutka\"). For the latter, dry sugar is spread over raw fruit in layers and left for several hours to steep into the fruit. The resulting mixture is then heated for just about five minutes.\n\nThe most popular types of varenye are made from locally available berries and fruits, such as sour cherries, strawberries, raspberries, apricots and apples. In general, virtually any kind of fruit, as well as some culinary vegetables, nuts, pine cones, and rose petals are used.\n\nVarenye is enjoyed as a dessert and condiment, in particular as a topping for pancakes (bliny, oladyi, syrniki), as a filling for pies (pirogi and pirozhki), dumplings (vareniki), cakes and cookies, and as a sweetener for tea. It is also used as a spread on bread, though due to its liquid consistency it is not well suited for that. Finally, it is eaten on its own as a sweet.\n\n\"Varenye\" is an old Slavic word which is used in East Slavic languages in a more general sense to refer to any type of sweet fruit preserve. The word has common etymological roots with the words denoting cooking, boiling, brewing, or stewing (, , ).\n\nIn literary translations, especially of children's books, into Russian, the term is often used to replace less-common loanwords, such as jam, confiture or marmalade. Examples are the translations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harry Potter, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and the animated movies about Karlsson-on-the-roof.\n\nThe same is true when translating \"from\" Russian. For instance, the making of raspberry varenie is described in Leo Tolstoy's novel \"Anna Karenina\" (VI-2). In her classic translation, Constance Garnett refers to the activity as \"jam-making\".\n\nIn the popular Soviet children's book \"A tale about a war secret, about the boy Nipper-Pipper, and his word of honour\" by Arkady Gaidar the antihero Little Baddun betrays his friends for \"a barrel of varenye and a basket of biscuits\" (; again, in English translation \"jam\" is used instead of varenye). This phrase became an idiomatic expression for betrayal or selling out in Russian, similar to thirty pieces of silver.\n\nThe more general usage of the term varenye in Russian includes a number of related local specialties.\n\nIn the preparation of \"raw varenye\" (, \"syroye varenye\") the heating is omitted completely. The recipes usually include grating of raw berries or other fruits and mixing them with sugar.\n\nIn pre-revolutionary Russia, \"dry varenye\" (, \"sukhoe varenye\") referred to a local variety of candied fruits (fruit confit) obtained by extracting fruits from varenye syrup and drying them. Kiev (today the capital of Ukraine) was particularly famous for this delicacy.\n\nSimilar confections are also made in Transcaucasia and in some regions of Central and South Asia, where they are called murabba.\n"}

{"id": "42060235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42060235", "title": "Soplica", "text": "Soplica\n\nSoplica () is one of the older brands of Polish pure and flavoured vodka, having been first produced in 1891 (in a factory that was opened in 1888). Although the origins of vodka in Poland can be traced back to as early as the 8th century, Soplica is one of the older industrially produced brands of vodka in the country. Żubrówka, for example, is based on a much older recipe than Soplica (dating back to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) but exists as an industrially produced brand only since the 1920s.\n\nThe creator of Soplica vodka was Bolesław Kasprowicz, who in 1888 founded the \"Fabryka Wódek i Likierów w Gnieźnie\" (Factory of Vodka and Liqueur in Gniezno). The first bottle of Soplica was produced there in 1891, as proven by the replica of the bottle that is held in the \"Muzeum Początków Państwa Polskiego w Gnieźnie\" (Museum of the Origins of the Polish State in Gniezno) to this day. Bolesław Michał Kasprowicz (as was his full name) originally came from the town of Czempiń in the Greater Poland voivodeship. Upon starting his distillery in Gniezno, he quickly became one of the pioneers of alcohol trade of the time. Three years after starting the works, in 1891, Kasprowicz introduced the Soplica clear vodka onto the Polish market. In just a few years, the production facility in Gniezno became a large enterprise, processing as much as 3 wagons of pure spirits a week.\n\nDuring World War I, Kasprowicz's factory in Gniezno suspended its activity and Kasprowicz himself became involved in nationwide efforts to regain Poland's independence as a sovereign state following 123 years of foreign rule. From the distillery's formation until 1913, Kasprowicz's vodkas and liqueurs earned 73 different awards (including 4 gold medals) on the Polish market and abroad. He became an important figure in the municipality, finally taking office as the city president of Gniezno in 1919. It was not until 1920 that he returned to his role as the manager of his own factory. During the German occupation of Poland in World War II, Kasprowicz was deported to annexed Warsaw by the Nazis and died there in 1943.\n\nThe recipes still used for Soplica vodkas and liqueurs were developed by Kasprowicz himself. He was the author of many unique formulas which were handwritten and documented in a tome called \"recepturarz\". All of the wares created by Kasprowicz were marked with the initials B.K. as well as the picture of a carp. The names of all products from his factory referenced Polish tradition and literature. This custom has survived many years, as even now on the labels of modern versions of Soplica vodka there is an image of a dworek (manor houses historically owned by the Polish szlachta) – a reference to the national epic poem Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz.\n\nDuring the first 50 years of its production factories' existence (1888–1939), Kasprowicz's firm earned 93 medals and distinctions for the quality of its products. Since 2009, the pure original version of Soplica as well as its several flavoured variants have been earning numerous awards in both expert and consumer contests. Currently, the Soplica brand is owned by the Poland-based CEDC. Although CEDC was acquired by the Russian Standard Corporation in 2013, its products—including Soplica—are still made by Poles using their traditional methods. More specifically, Soplica products are manufactured by Polmos Łańcut in the city of Łańcut, which is located in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship of southeastern Poland.\n\nNowadays Soplica comes as several different products. There are the traditional Soplica vodkas with a 40% ABV. A spirit of 60% ABV is sold separately. There are also flavoured variants (commonly known in Polish as \"nalewki\", singular nalewka) which have a lower ABV of 30%.

{"id": "42084846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42084846", "title": "Black pudding", "text": "Black pudding\n\nBlack pudding is a type of blood sausage originating in Great Britain and Ireland. It is made from pork blood, with pork fat or beef suet, and a cereal, usually oatmeal, oat groats or barley groats. The high proportion of cereal, along with the use of certain herbs such as pennyroyal, serves to distinguish black pudding from blood sausages eaten in other parts of the world.\n\nThe word \"pudding\" is believed to come from the French \"boudin\", originally from the Latin \"botellus\", meaning \"small sausage\", referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings.\n\nBlood puddings are often supposed to be one of the oldest forms of sausage. Animals are generally bled at slaughter, and as blood does not keep unless prepared in some way, making a pudding with it is one of the easiest ways of ensuring it does not go to waste. While the majority of modern black pudding recipes involve pork blood, this has not always been the case; sheep or cow blood was also used, and one 15th-century English recipe used that of a porpoise, in a pudding eaten exclusively by the nobility. Until at least the 19th century, cow or sheep blood was the usual basis for black puddings in Scotland; Jamieson's Scottish dictionary defined \"black pudding\" as \"a pudding made of the blood of a cow or sheep\". \n\nAs a product of the slaughtering process, eating black puddings was historically associated with Martinmas, when the annual slaughter of livestock took place. By the 19th century black pudding manufacture was linked with towns known for their large markets for pork, such as Stretford, then in Lancashire, or Cork, Ireland. By this time, black puddings were generally omitted from recipe books aimed at urban housewives, as they no longer usually had access to home-killed pork, although recipes appeared in Scottish books until the 20th century.\n\nMost traditional recipes from the United Kingdom involve stirring the fresh blood, adding fat and some form of rusk, and seasoning, before filling the mixture into a casing and boiling it. Natural casings of beef intestine were formerly used, though modern commercially made puddings use synthetic cellulose skins, and are usually produced from imported dried blood. The relatively limited range of ingredients and use of oats or barley to thicken and absorb the blood is typical of black pudding in comparison to Continental blood sausages. Despite this, black pudding recipes still show more regional variation across the country than other sausages, with many butchers having their own individual versions. Breadcrumbs or flour are sometimes used to supplement the oats or barley, and the proportion and texture of the fat or suet used can also vary widely. Pennyroyal, marjoram, thyme, and mint are all traditional flavourings: pennyroyal was known as \"pudding-yerb\" in the North Riding of Yorkshire for its use in black puddings. Other herbs and spices sometimes used in traditional black puddings include cumin, rue and parsley.\n\nWhile the dish has been known as \"black pudding\" for centuries, \"blak podyngs\" having been recorded in c.1450, a number of dialect names have also been used for the dish, such as \"black pot\" (in Somerset), and \"bloody pot\", particularly in reference to versions cooked in an earthenware pot rather than in a sausage casing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, black pudding is especially associated with the Black Country, the West Midlands, Scotland, and the North West of England: it is considered a particular delicacy in Stornoway and in Lancashire, notably in towns such as Bury, where it is traditionally boiled and served with malt vinegar out of paper wrapping. It was also found in Yorkshire, where black puddings were flavoured with lemon thyme and savory: Barnsley black puddings were particularly well-known. The Stornoway black pudding, made in the Western Isles of Scotland, has been granted Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin status. In the wake of this designation, butchers in Bury sought to demonstrate their history of manufacturing and selling the product. One such claim dates back to 1810. Having been brought there by emigrants, black pudding is now part of the local cuisine of the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. Black pudding is also widely available in supermarkets and butchers' shops in Australia and New Zealand, although is not as popular as in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, in addition to the more general type of black pudding, there is a distinct regional variety called drisheen, which is particularly associated with Cork. Drisheen is usually made from cow's blood, although until the recent past it was often also made with sheep blood, and was sometimes flavoured with tansy.\n\nBlack pudding can be grilled, fried, baked or boiled in its skin. It can also be eaten cold, as it is cooked in production. In parts of north-western England and in the Black Country it was usual to serve a whole black pudding boiled as a complete meal, with bread or potatoes, but elsewhere in the UK and Ireland slices of fried or grilled black puddings are more usually served as part of a traditional full breakfast, a tradition that followed British and Irish emigrants around the world. \n\nIn Scotland and the north of England some chip shops sell deep-fried, battered black pudding.\n\nNovel culinary uses for black pudding include black pudding ice cream, while perhaps a more conventional modern recipe is using it as an accompaniment to scallops. Scotch eggs made with black pudding, such as the \"Manchester egg\", have become common.\n\nBlack pudding is a good source of protein, is low in carbohydrate and high in zinc and iron. It has been described as a \"superfood\" because of these nutritional qualities, although many recipes are also very high in saturated fat and salt.\n\nSince the 1980s, the World Black Pudding Throwing Championships has been held in Ramsbottom. The humorous competition invokes the traditional Lancashire – Yorkshire rivalry, with participants throwing the black puddings at piles of Yorkshire puddings. It takes place annually in September, and draws thousands of competitors and spectators to the town.\n\nIn past years the Bacup Food and Black Pudding Festival has been held in Bacup.\n\n"}

Guthuk is then eaten on Losar to symbolise getting rid of negativities of the past year and invite positives into the new year.\n\nIn the Thukpa bhatuk soup, the main components are the handmade bhatsa noodles, which are similar to the Italian gnocchi. Some bhatsa noodles used for this soup are called gutsi rithuk and another noodle, called bhatuk.

It is custom for homes and bodies to be purified and cleaned to invite positives for the New Year. The New Year is then brought in with specific ceremonial rituals including the specially made Thukpa batuk called Guthuk. This soup is made on Nyi-Shu-Gu and is specific to the celebration of Losar.\n\nAs explained, Nyi-Shu-Gu is the Tibetan New Year's Eve, which is the 29th day of the last month of the year, according to the Tibetan calendar and Nepali calendar. Nyi-Shu-Gu is a day to dismiss negativities from homes and bodies and to make the Guthuk soup. \nA traditional custom in Central Tibet is to heat water over a fire for everyone to bathe and wash their hair. Normally, people don’t bathe everyday, but everyone takes care to be thoroughly clean in preparation for Losar. Once everything is purified, the Guthuk soup is eaten and the negativities are expelled.\n\n"}

Apparently, the pantxineta was devised in an attempt to imitate traditional French frangipane tarts; however, instead of employing the usual almond-based frangipane filling, a baker at Otaegui used a thick custard, and covered the tart with an outer layer of puff-pastry. They initially called the desert a \"frantxi-pan\", which in the local basque dialect quickly evolved into \"pantxineta\".\n\nSince its inception, the desert has grown in popularity due to its simplicity and tastiness, and it is nowadays considered one of the cornerstone desserts of basque gastronomy.

{"id": "42259610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42259610", "title": "Candy making", "text": "Candy making\n\nCandy making or candymaking is the preparation and cookery of candies and sugar confections. Candy making includes the preparation of many various candies, such as hard candies, jelly beans, gumdrops, taffy, liquorice, cotton candy, chocolates and chocolate truffles, dragées, fudge, caramel candy and toffee.\n\nCandy is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a syrup, which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to caramelize. The type of candy depends on the ingredients and how long the mixture is boiled. Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle. A chocolatier is a person who prepares confectionery from chocolate, and is distinct from a chocolate maker, who creates chocolate from cacao beans and other ingredients. Cotton candy is a form of spun sugar often prepared using a cotton candy machine.\n\nThe technology for candy making has generally kept pace with the technology of the times. For example, when steam power became common in factories, steam power was also used in candy factories.\n\nCandy making and consumption increased greatly during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. Candy had previously been made by hand, either occasionally at home or by specialists in small, local businesses. Increased mechanization caused prices to drop and production to increase.\n\nIn the late 19th century and especially the early 20th century, industrial candy making was almost exclusively a masculine affair, and home-based candy making was a feminine affair. Candy was considered sweet and dainty, so making it at home, giving it away to friends, and perhaps selling small amounts in the local area, conformed with the Western gender roles for women of the time. Most women making and selling candy did so only seasonally or for a little extra money; they rarely earned enough to support themselves or their families. Despite several large brands being named after women or otherwise capitalizing on wholesome, feminine, and maternal images, very few were owned or operated by women.\nGender segregation also affected candy workers in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Men and boys were employed for cooking or operating machinery. Women were mostly employed for wrapping and putting candies in packages or for hand-dipping candies in chocolate. The best-paid women were chocolate dippers, yet the wages of these skilled and experienced female workers were almost always lower than that of the worst-paid male machine operators.\n\nHard candy, also referred to as boiled sweet, is a candy prepared from one or more syrups boiled to a temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). After a syrup boiled to this temperature cools, it is called hard candy, since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature. Hard candy recipes variously call for syrups of sucrose, glucose, or fructose. To add color, food coloring is sometimes used.\n\nThe final texture of candy depends on the sugar concentration. As the syrup is heated, it boils and the sugar concentration increases as water evaporates. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration because the boiling-point elevation of the sugar solution is a colligative property (i.e., it is related to the concentration of the solution), so temperature is used as a marker for the necessary concentration. In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies. The stages of sugar cooking are as follows:\n\nThe names come from the methods used to test the syrup before thermometers became affordable. The \"thread\" stage is tested by cooling a little syrup, and pulling it between the thumb and forefinger. When the correct stage is reached, a thread will form. This stage is used for making syrups. For subsequent stages, a small spoonful of syrup is dropped into cold water, and the characteristics of the resulting lump are evaluated to determine the concentration of the syrup. A smooth lump indicates \"ball\" stages, with the corresponding hardness described. At the \"soft crack\" stage, the syrup forms threads that are just pliable. At the \"hard crack\" stage, the threads are brittle.\n\nThis method is still used today in some kitchens. A candy thermometer is more convenient, but has the drawback of not automatically adjusting for local conditions such as altitude, as the cold water test does.\n\nOnce the syrup reaches or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an amber-colored substance known as caramel. This should not be confused with caramel candy, although it is the candy's main flavoring.\n\nCotton candy, also known as candy floss, is a form of spun sugar. Typical machines used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. After the product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, a stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.\n\nMarshmallows are prepared using egg whites, corn syrup and sugar. The use of marshmallow to make a sweet dates back to ancient Egypt, where the recipe called for an extract from the root of the marshmallow plant (\"Althaea officinalis\") and mixing it with nuts and honey. Another pre-modern recipe uses the pith of the marshmallow plant, rather than the root. In modern times, marshmallows are often commercially prepared using extrusion.\n\nChocolatiering, the preparing of confections from chocolate, involves the techniques of tempering, molding and sculpting. Tempering is a heat treatment method performed on chocolate involving heating and cooling the chocolate to result in desired characteristics like shininess of the chocolate or 'snap', the way it breaks. Molding is a design technique used in making chocolate pieces that are of a certain shape by taking liquid chocolate and pouring it into a mold and letting it harden. Sculpting is a type of three-dimensional artwork that may involve using molds and pieces of chocolate, and decorating the piece with designs in chocolate.\n\nMaking candy can be hazardous due to the use of boiled sugar and melted chocolate. Boiling sugar often exceeds —hotter than most cooked foods—and the sugar tends to stick to the skin, causing burns and blisters upon skin contact. Worker safety programs focus on reducing contact between workers and hot food or hot equipment, and reducing splashing, because even small splashes can cause burns. \n\nSome ingredients can also irritate the eyes and lungs, if, for example, powdered ingredients are accidentally inhaled, so worker protection involves reducing exposure to potentially irritating ingredients. Occupational dust exposure reduction measures can reduce health problems among workers. \n\nDust control measures can reduce risk of catastrophic dust explosions from sugar and other ingredients in candy. Dust explosions have caused destroyed factories and killed candy makers. Some dust explosions include the 1948 explosion of a Brach's candy factory in Chicago, in which 17 employees died, and as recently as the three sugar silo fires at Perfetti Van Melle's candy factory in Kentucky, in 2003, 2015, and 2017.\n\nA variety of tools and machines are used in making candy, ranging from simple kitchen tools like bowls and spoons to elaborate factory machinery.\n\nBecause exact temperature control is critical for some candies, a common tool is the candy thermometer. Inexpensive candy thermometers measure food temperatures up to about 160 °C, and those designed for commercial candy production may run even higher.\n\nA starch mogul is used in candy factories to shape soft candies or candy centers from syrups or gels. These centers may then be sent through a chocolate enrober to coat them in chocolate.\n\nAlthough skilled workers, candy makers are not generally highly paid.

It is commonly served with carbohydrates, such as noodles or congee.\n\nPig blood curd originated from blood rice pudding (米血糕) in southern China. Blood rice pudding is a pastry made from blood and rice grains. Rice is the main ingredient of southern Chinese cuisine; the two common methods to cook rice are steaming and boiling. Duck meat is a source of supplement (補劑), however, because of the poor living conditions in the past, poultry was only offered as sacrifices in Chinese festivals. In order to get nutrition from the ducks, farmers saved the blood, steamed it with rice, and served it with sauce. Later, blood rice pudding spread to neighboring towns and villages, and people named it duck blood pudding (鴨血糕). However, because of the rising price of duck, and the inability of chicken blood to coagulate into pudding, pig blood replaced duck blood, resulting in the birth of pig blood curd.\n\nPig blood curd is solid pig blood. Manufacturers coagulate fresh blood by letting it sit in a clean container for around 10 minutes. The blood cube is cut into smaller pieces, then heated in a pot with medium heat with water. During the heating process, salt is added to solidify the blood cubes, and the pot is occasionally stirred to prevent the water from boiling. After 30 minutes, pig blood curd is ready to be served. Note that pig blood curds sold in markets should contain small air holes.\n\nPig blood curd is soft and smooth, as well as slightly chewy. It can be eaten by itself, or served in boiled soup, hot pot, or even made as a snack on a stick.\n\nPig's blood can also be made into a variety of dishes:\nIn China, there are recipes like \"pig blood curd congee\" (豬血粥), which is pig blood curd in congee, and \"Maoxuewang\" (毛血旺), a Sichuan dish served with pig blood curd, part of the cow's stomach, luncheon meat, eel, some form of intestine, and bean sprouts in Sichuan style spicy soup.\nIn Taiwan, pig's blood is made into a famous street snack called \"pig's blood cake\" (豬血糕), which is a mixture of pig's blood, fried or steamed sticky rice, and peanut flour served on a stick.\n\nPig's blood is also made into food by many western countries. For example, in Britain, black pudding (Blood sausage) is made from pig's blood and a high proportion of oatmeal.\n\nPig's blood curd is rich in riboflavin, vitamin C, protein, iron, phosphorus, calcium, niacin and other minerals. Moreover, it is easy for the body to digest and absorb. It also contains a certain amount of lecithin and can curb the harmful effects of low density cholesterol.\n\nExcessive consumption may cause iron poisoning. It might affect the absorption of other minerals. Therefore, it is suggested to eat pig blood no more than twice in a week. Also, it should not be consumed with soya bean or kelp, they may result in indigestion and constipation respectively.\n"}

Not as hoppy as a modern IPA, it is today sometimes classed as a \"premium bitter\". \n\n\"White Shield\" was first brewed by the Worthington Brewery in Burton upon Trent in 1829, principally for export to the British Empire. Worthington merged with local rival Bass in 1927, which was itself taken over by Coors in 2002.\n\n\"White Shield\" has won the CAMRA Champion Bottled Beer of Britain Gold award three times, more than any other beer.\n\n\"White Shield\" is principally available as a bottle conditioned beer, although it has periodically been made available in cask-conditioned form.\n\n\"White Shield\" is brewed using pale malt and a small amount of crystal malt. The hops used are Challenger, Fuggles and Northdown. Different yeasts are used for primary and secondary fermentation. After primary fermentation, the beer is conditioned in bulk for three weeks. Once packaged, it is matured in the bottle for a month before being sent out for distribution. Molson Coors claim that the beer will continue to mature in the bottle for up to three years. Former \"White Shield\" brewer Steve Wellington described the product in 2011 as \"pretty much unchanged since appearing first in 1829\".\n\nWorthington launched \"East India Pale Ale\", their first IPA, in 1829. It was exported to British expatriates across the Empire, mostly officers and civil servants, as the soldiers tended to drink porter, which was more affordable. The growth of the railway network allowed for increased distribution of the beer throughout the United Kingdom. The beer was brewed using the Burton Union system.\n\nThe White Shield logo was introduced from the 1870s, and by the end of the nineteenth century the beer took on this name with drinkers. Worthington officially renamed their India Pale Ale \"White Shield\" from 1950.\n\n92,000 barrels of \"White Shield\" were brewed in 1952–53. However, by the 1960s \"White Shield\" had become a cult drink brewed in small quantities for a dedicated following; production in 1965 was just 15,000 barrels as drinkers switched to filtered and pasteurised bottled and keg beers. It found renewed popularity in the early 1970s as the demand for real ale grew, but lost this position as the availability of cask ale improved.\n\nBass relocated production from Burton to their Hope & Anchor brewery in Sheffield in 1981, and the beer ceased to be brewed using the Burton Union method. Production in 1988 totalled 12,000 barrels. The Hope & Anchor brewery was closed down in 1992, and production was moved to Cape Hill in Birmingham, before production was contracted to King and Barnes of Sussex in 1998. By this time, production was down to just 1,000 barrels a year, and the beer's long-term survival was in doubt. The King and Barnes brewery closed down in 2000, and production moved to the Bass owned White Shield microbrewery in Burton upon Trent.\n\nIn 2000, a total of 500 barrels were produced; this was forecast to grow to 1,000 barrels by 2009. In 2010, production was moved to the newly constructed William Worthington's Brewery, a microbrewery based at the National Brewery Centre in Burton. It also produces other Worthington beers such as \"E\" and seasonal beers. In 2012, increasing demand saw \"White Shield\" production moved to the main Coors brewery in Burton.\n\nRoger Protz reported that \"White Shield\" was the highest selling bottle conditioned beer in Britain in 2013. However in 2018 he suggested that distribution of the beer had declined.\n"}

It is popularly known as \"Manadonese cuisine\" after Manado, the capital of the province, although other cities in North Sulawesi, such as Bitung, Tomohon and Tondano are also known as Minahasan culinary hotspots. Manadonese cuisine is known for its rich variations in seafood, daring amount of spices, extra hot condiments, exotic meats, and European-influenced cakes and pastries.\nPopular Manadonese dishes include: tinutuan (Manado-style vegetable and rice congee), cakalang fufu (smoked skipjack tuna), cakalang noodle, paniki (spiced fruit bat), chicken or various fish/seafood spiced in rica-rica or woku spices, chicken tuturuga, and brenebon.\n\nAlthough not as popular and as widely distributed as Padang food and Sundanese cuisine, there is increasing awareness of Manadonese cuisine in the Indonesian cuisine scene. Numbers of Manadonese restaurants are growing in Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Medan, Surabaya and Makassar.\n\nManadonese cuisine is marked by a mixture of native and foreign influences. Native Minahasan cooking tradition relies heavily on seafood as well as exotic bushmeats, and its heavy use of freshly chopped hot spices. It also demonstrates Chinese and European influences (especially Portuguese and Dutch), most prominent in their soup, cake, and pastry delicacies.\n\nChicken and beef are commonly consumed. A significant number of Minahasans are Christians, hence the halal dietary law has not played an important role in the cuisine's development as it has in the Minahasans' Muslim neighbors on the Sulawesi island (the Gorontalos and Northern Maluku people). Subsequently, pork, wild boar, and even dog meat and bat is more ubiquitous in Manadonese cuisine compared to other culinary traditions in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nManadonese cuisine is well known for its generous use of spices, sometimes making up more than half of the whole dish's ingredients. It has given the cuisine the reputation of being hot and spicy, often from the freshly chopped chili peppers added in. Common spices used in Manadonese cuisine include lemongrass, lime or citrus leaves, lime juice, chili peppers, spring onion, shallots, garlic and candlenut. Seafood, pork and chicken are often cooked in Manadonese signature \"bumbu\" (spice blends), such as rica-rica and woku. Spicy condiments are also served as dipping sauce for seafood, such as dabu-dabu and sambal roa.\n\nMinahassa Peninsula – the northern arm of Sulawesi, a narrow peninsula that formed the North Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces – are surrounded by seas in almost all sides. Minahasan people that inhabit the area have been harvesting the bounty of seas since a long time ago, therefore seafood is popular and almost become a staple diet. The Sulawesi Sea and Maluku Sea, and Gulf of Tomini are teeming with marine life. The harbor cities of Manado and Bitung are the center of fishing industry in the area. Actually, the whole eastern provinces of Indonesia, from Sulawesi to Maluku archipelago, are famous for their seafood.\nVarious seafood such as \"cakalang\" (skipjack tuna), \"tude\" (mackerel), \"oci\" (larger mackerel), tuna, albacore, \"bobara\" (trevally), \"kakap\" (red snapper), \"kerapu\" (garoupa), \"tenggiri\" (wahoo), \"bawal\" (pomfret), shrimp, mussels and crabs are available in marketplace, and often being grilled on charcoal, and served in dabu-dabu condiment; cooked in woku or rica-rica spice, or in kuah asam soup.\n\nMinahasan people are also known for their bushmeats tradition. Before converting to Christianity in early 16th to 17th century, Minahasans were animists, and their practice on consuming almost every kind of animal still continued until this days. \"Rintek wu'uk\" or RW (lit. Minahasan: \"fine hair\") is euphemism of dog meat. In Minahasan culture it is considered prestigious to consume rare and unusual meats. The marketplaces of the mountainous town of Tomohon and Tondano are notorious for selling various kinds of exotic bushmeats; from wild boar, field rats, \"patola\" snake (python), frog legs, paniki or fruit bats, to cat and dog meat. Sometimes protected endangered animals such as \"yaki\" (Sulawesi black macaque), \"kuse\" (slow loris), tapir and anoa are illegally sold in marketplace as food.\n\nAmong Indonesian ethnicities, Minahasans are well known for their affinities with European culture. A number of European-influenced cakes and pastries made their way into the Minahasan kitchen. The most notable probably is klappertaart (from Dutch language, lit. coconut tart). Another example is panada, a Portuguese-influenced \"pan\" (bread) similar to empanadas and filled with spiced ground skipjack tuna.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The basic ingredients are rice, sugar, rice flour and milk. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, \"muhallebi\" and its European counterpart \"blancmange\" were made with shredded chicken. The traditional recipe is still common in Turkey. Israeli \"malabi\" is usually flavored with syrup or culinary rose water, and sometimes the milk is replaced with grape juice to make the pudding pareve.\n\nLegend has it that \"muhallebi\" was introduced into Arab cuisine in the late seventh century by a Persian cook who served it to an Arab general by the name of Al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra. He liked it so much, he named it after himself. The earliest recipes dating to the 10th-century, featured three versions: milk thickened with ground rice, milk with rice grains and chicken, and an egg custard without rice. The earliest recipe for \"muhallabiyya\" is attributed to Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq of Baghdad. Two 13th-century Arab cookbooks, one by al-Baghdadi and another from Andalusia, have a spiced pudding variation made with mutton instead of chicken. The account of the pudding's Persian origins comes from the Andalusian cookbook.\n\nThere are records from the Ottoman Empire for two versions of \"muhallebi\"; a version with shredded chicken (\"tavuk göğsü\") was served during reign of Mehmed the Conqueror and a later recipe dating to 1530 for a meatless version flavored with rose water.\n\nOne 19th century English cookbook that gives a recipe for \"muhallebi\" calls it \"Ramazan cakes\". The recipe calls for boiling milk together with rice flour and sugar until the mixture reduces. The pudding is flavored with rose or jasmine extract, and allowed to cool before it is sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nIn the modern era the traditional \"tavuk göğsü\" is no longer widely available, except in Turkey. This pudding does not taste like chicken but the shredded meat gives it a distinctive texture. George Coleman De Kay said the pudding \"owes its peculiar excellent flavour to the presence of the breasts of very young chickens, which are by some means so intimately blended and incorporated with the custard as to be scarcely distinguishable\". \"Kazandibi\" is a variation of the classic \"tavuk göğsü\" where a thin layer of pudding is caramelized before the custard is poured over it and allowed to set. The finished pudding is served upside down with the caramelized side on top.\n\nMastic can be used as a flavoring for \"muhallebis\"—this is called \"sakızlı muhallebi\". Rice flour is used to thicken the pudding, but this can be combined or replaced with corn starch or wheat starch depending on the cook's preference.\n\nIn Israel, \"malabi\" (מלבי) is a popular dessert associated with Jewish-Turkish Sephardic cuisine. It is made from cream and milk cooked with corn starch and rose syrup. Sometimes white grape juice is substituted for the almond milk.\n\nSimilar to the Turkish keşkül, the Israeli version is topped with chopped pistachios, desiccated coconut and flavorings like as rose or orange water.\n\nChefs Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, in Jerusalem: A Cookbook, define malabi as the \"dessert form of sahlab,\" both a flour made from the tubers of the orchid genus Orchis and the name for the warm, less viscous version of the cold dessert.\n\nIn Cyprus, mahalebi or mahalepi (Μαχαλεπί in Greek) does not contain milk. Cypriot muhallebi is made from water, sugar, nisete flour (it can still be made from corn starch or corn flour) and rose water (optional). When the muhallebi is set the Cypriots add rose squash/cordia/syrup called triantafyllo (τριαντάφυλλο in Greek) on top of it.\n\nIn some Sephardi homes, malabi is served to break the fast on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. It is also eaten at Turkish Jewish weddings to symbolize the sweet life that lies ahead. Sephardim serve it on the festival of Shavuot when it is customary to eat dairy food, but according to food historian Gil Marks, the real reason is that the holiday is known in this community as the \"feast of roses\", and malabi is traditionally topped with rosewater.\n"}

It has been described as \"small squares of pressed fruit paste\" and \"light, airy puffs with a delicate apple flavor\". In Imperial Russia, the \"small jellied sweetmeats\" were served for tea \"with a white foamy top, a bit like marshmallow, but tasting of pure fruit\".\n\nThe first mentions of pastila in Russian written sources date back to the 16th century. The name is probably a loanword from or \"pastiglia\", or from the cognate which in turn comes from (a loaf or pie, cf. pastilla).\n\nIn the 19th century, pastila was made from sourish Russian apples such as Antonovka or mashed Northern berries (lingonberry, rowan, currants) sweetened with honey or sugar and lightened with egg whites. The paste was baked in the Russian oven for many hours, then arranged in several layers inside an alder box and then left to dry in the same oven.\n\nIn Imperial Russia, pastila was considered an expensive treat. Priced at one rouble and a half, it was produced at noblemen's manors by serf labor. The cheapest pastila was made with honey instead of sugar. The Russian stove afforded two days of steadily diminishing heat to bake the fruit paste. A Tatar variety was strained through a fine sieve, which helped keep apple seeds intact.\n\nIn the Soviet period, pastila was produced using an industrially optimised technology. According to William Pokhlyobkin, this Soviet-style pastila does not depend on the unique properties of the peasant stove and is markedly inferior to its homemade predecessors. It was ultimately eclipsed in popularity by zefir, which is made from similar ingredients but with whipped egg whites and gelling agents.\n\nIn the 2010s, traditional pastila is regaining its popularity, with the Kolomna and especially Belyov versions widely available commercially.\n\nKolomna claims to be the birthplace of original \"white-foam\" pastila and maintains a museum and a museum factory dedicated to history and traditions of pastila production. The museum occupies a merchant house dating from ca. 1800, while the museum factory is located in a historical factory building. Rzhev and Belyov used to be known as other important centres of production. Kolomna has been hand-made from apples for more than three hundred years. The process included whipping apple puree with egg whites and drying the paste in a stove. The finished product could be stored for many years. In 1735 the first pastila factory (\"pastilnaya\") was set up. Unfortunately, the pastila recipes and the product itself were forgotten after the Russian Revolution.\n\nIn 2008, during the European skating championship in Kolomna, the project \"History with flavor\" was implemented, which resulted in the revival of Kolomna pastila production process. The forsaken symbol of Kolomna was regained with the opening of the pastila factory and the museum that followed.\n\nThe museum was set up in a historical building in the old part of the city. In the building next to it one can find the factory itself. During the theatrical performance that accompanies excursion visitors are offered a number of unique sorts of pastila. There is also another museum where tourists can both listen to the story of pastila and buy a box of traditional Russian dessert. The museum is situated at 13A, Posadskaya St., Kolomna, Moscow region.\n\n\n"}

It is served in most regions of Uganda and is defined as a mixture of ingredients.The main ingredients of the dish are matooke and a sauce (beef, offal, beans)\n\nKatogo originated from Buganda and Western Uganda, where it was initially perceived as a poor man's dish. There is no exact chronology as to when Ugandans started cooking katogo, but as long as matooke has been around, so has katogo. The Baganda came up with the katogo dish which is a combination of offal and matooke. Katogo was originally a combination of diced cassava mixed with beans. This was the poor man's meal. The upper classes, introduced matooke to replace cassava and later versions of katogo brought on offals and other new sauces. The popularity of katogo quickly spread all over Uganda and to date there are many variations of the cuisine. It is a common delicacy among the Bantu speaking communities and most of Uganda’s urban communities. It is now available in most restaurants and hotels, served as breakfast.\n\nThere are various recipes for this dish but the most popular is the one where matooke is the staple and the sauce is offal known as \"byenda\" in Uganda. The culinary term for \"byenda\" (offal) is tripe and sweetbreads which are the inner lining of the stomach, the thymus gland and the pancreas respectively. The peeled matooke (green bananas) are cooked in the prepared sauce of byenda (offals) until the matooke is ready. Katogo is usually served with cooked greens and fruit juice.\n\nThe process of cooking is done by braising the sauce (offal, beef, ground peanuts or beans) which is brought to a boil and later simmered until it is ready. The sauce is then poured over the peeled matoke and left to simmer until the matooke is ready. Katogo takes a relatively short time to prepare and today most people use wood or charcoal as a cooking fuel.\n\nThe variations of this dish include a staple (matooke, Irish potatoes, cassava or sweet potatoes) which is cooked in the same pot with a sauce (beef, offal, beans, peas, groundnuts or greens).\n\n"}

NT Draught are the makers of the Darwin Stubby. A Darwin Stubby refers to several large beer bottle sizes in Australia. It was first introduced in April 1958 with an 80-imperial-fluid-ounce (2,270 ml; 76.9 U.S. fl oz) capacity. The 2.25-litre (76.1 U.S. fl oz; 79.2 imp fl oz) Darwin Stubby has an iconic, if kitsch status in Australian folklore. In May 2015 Carlton & United Breweries announced that they will no longer brew NT Draught on a regular basis.\n\nDarwin's first brewery, designated \"Darwin Brewery\", was founded in 1951 by Harry Ellis-Kells in the Berrimah industrial area, 3 miles from Darwin's GPO, and before long was producing four kinds of beer: Buffalo Bitter, Palmerston Dinner Ale, Darwin Ale and Darwin Lager. Ellis-Kells \"skipped town\" in August that year after being successfully sued by contractor E. Favaro for ₤359.\nIn 1952 the property was sold to brothers Bernard and John Lyall Allen, who floated a company to purchase the site from them and to erect additional buildings, procure equipment and hire staff to re-commence brewing at the site, but due to insufficient interest, the venture was called off.\n\nIn 1956 Carlton & United Breweries established their Darwin brewery, N.T. Brewery Pty. Ltd., in the suburb of Berrimah. The first beer, Carlton Draught, was brewed on 13 October of that year. The brewery, however, did not have an associated bottling plant, so bottled beer still had to be shipped from Melbourne. Due to the logistics of shipping bottles such a long distance, the company decided in April 1958 to introduce a bigger bottle, a bottle, which became known as the \"Darwin Stubby\".\nAt that time most hotels in the Darwin area were owned by the Swan Brewing Company of Western Australia, which preferred to sell its own beer from these outlets, so the \"Darwin Stubby\" was only available from one or two independent hotels and licensed stores, mostly grocers and supermarkets.\n\nIn 1981 Swan Brewery and CUB formed a merged entity Northern Territory Breweries Pty Ltd. In 1981 CUB bought out Swan’s interest leaving it in sole control of the Northern Territory beer market. The Darwin brewery closed in 1989 however NT Draught continued to be brewed from the company's Melbourne brewery. In October 1996 CUB acquired the 200,000 hl Darwin Brewery in Winnellie from Goldchill Brewing, and commenced production of Victoria Bitter and Carlton Light for the Northern Territory in November. The brewery also produced NT Draught in the Darwin Stubby. \n\nIn May 2015 Carlton & United Breweries announced that due to decreasing volumes and increasing costs that it would be ceasing production of NT Draught. The company did advise that it would become one of their heritage beers and they would investigate bringing it out in special runs.\n\n"}

{"id": "42395737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42395737", "title": "Grape syrup", "text": "Grape syrup\n\nGrape syrup is a condiment made with concentrated grape juice. It is thick and sweet because of its high ratio of sugar to water. Grape syrup is made by boiling grapes, removing their skins, squeezing them through a sieve to extract the juice, and adding sugar. Like other fruit syrups, a common use of grape syrup is as a topping to sweet cakes, such as pancakes or waffles.\n\nThe ancient Greek name for grape syrup is ἕψημα, which transates to 'boiled'. The Greek name was used in Crete and, in modern times, in Cyprus.\n\n\"Petimezi\" is the name for a type of Mediterranean grape syrup. The word comes from the Turkish \"pekmez\", which usually refers to grape syrup, but is also used to refer to mulberry and other fruit syrups.\n\nVincotto (not to be confused with vino cotto) is the southern Italian term for grape syrup. It is made only from cooked wine grape must (mosto cotto), with no fermentation involved. There is no alcohol or vinegar content, and no additives, preservatives or sweeteners are added. It is both a condiment and ingredient used in either sweet or savory dishes.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of grape syrup comes from the fifth-century BC Greek physician Hippocrates, who refers to \"epsima\", the Greek name for the condiment. The fifth-century BC Athenian playwright Aristophanes also makes a reference to it, as does ancient Roman physician Galen.\n\nGrape syrup was known by different names in Ancient Roman cuisine depending on the boiling procedure. \"Defrutum\", \"carenum\", and \"sapa\" were reductions of must. They were made by boiling down grape juice or must in large kettles until it had been reduced to two-thirds of the original volume, \"carenum\"; half the original volume, \"defrutum\"; or one-third, \"sapa\". Roman general Pliny the Elder states that grape syrup was also referred to as \"siraion\" (Greek: \"σίραιον\").\n\nThe main culinary use of defrutum was to help preserve and sweeten wine, but it was also added to fruit and meat dishes as a sweetening and souring agent and even given to food animals such as ducks and suckling pigs to improve the taste of their flesh. Defrutum was mixed with garum to make the popular condiment oenogarum. Quince and melon were preserved in defrutum and honey through the winter, and some Roman women used defrutum or sapa as a cosmetic. Defrutum was often used as a food preservative in provisions for Roman troops.\n\n\"Defrutum \"is mentioned in almost all Roman books dealing with cooking or household management. Pliny the Elder recommended that defrutum only be boiled at the time of the new moon, while Cato the Censor suggested that only the sweetest possible defrutum should be used.\n\nIn ancient Rome, grape syrup was often boiled in lead pots, which sweetened the syrup through the leeching of the sweet-tasting chemical compound lead acetate into the syrup. Incidentally, this is thought to have caused lead poisoning for Romans consuming the syrup. A 2009 History Channel documentary produced a batch of historically accurate defrutum in lead-lined vessels and tested the liquid, finding a lead level of 29,000 parts per billion (ppb), which is 2,900 times higher than contemporary American drinking water limit of 10 ppb. These levels are easily high enough to cause either acute lead toxicity if consumed in large amounts or chronic lead poisoning when consumed in smaller quantities over a longer period of time (as defrutum was typically used).\n\nHowever, the use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard of use. Copper cookware was used far more generally and no indication exists as to how often sapa was added or in what quantity. There is not, however, scholarly agreement on the circumstances and quantity of lead in these ancient Roman condiments. For instance, the original research was done by Jerome Nriagu, but was criticized by John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, who characterized Nriagu's research as \"so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.\"\n\nThe ancient Greek name \"epsima\" (Cypriot Greek: έψημα) is still used to refer to the condiment, which is still made in Cyprus.\n\n\"Petimezi\" (Greek: πετιμέζι ), also called \"epsima\" (έψημα) and in English \"grapemust\" or \"grape molasses\", is a syrup that is reduced until it becomes dark and syrupy. Petimezi keeps indefinitely. Its flavor is sweet with slightly bitter undertones. The syrup may be light or dark colored, depending on the grapes used. Before the wide availability of inexpensive cane sugar, petimezi was a common sweetener in Greek cooking, along with carob syrup and honey. Petimzei is still used today in desserts and as a sweet topping for some foods. Though petimezi can be homemade, it is also sold commercially under different brand names.\n\nFrom late August until the beginning of December, many Greek bakeries sell dark crunchy and fragrant petimezi cookies, moustokoúloura (Greek: μουστοκούλουρα), are made.\n\n\"Petimezopita\" (Greek: πετιμεζόπιτα) is a spiced cake with petimezi.\n\nIn Iranian cuisine, grape syrup (in ) is used to sweeten ardeh (tahini), which is consumed at breakfast. An alternative is date syrup, which is also widely used in Middle Eastern cooking.\n\n\"Sapa\", \"vincotto\" or \"vino cotto\" is commonly used in Italy, especially in the regions of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Calabria, and Sardinia, where it is considered a traditional flavor.\n\n\"Arrope\" is a form of grape concentrate typically produced in Spain. Often derived from grape varieties such as Pedro Ximénez, it is made by boiling unfermented grape juice until the volume is reduced by at least 50%, and its viscosity reduced to a syrup. The final product is a thick liquid with cooked caramel flavours, and its use is frequent as an additive for dark, sweet wines such as sweet styles of sherry, Malaga, and Marsala.\n\nIn Turkey, grape syrup is known as \"petimezi\" or \"pekmez\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Ben Tre Province is nicknamed by Vietnamese as the \"Land of Coconut\" (Xu Dua). The Vietnamese term for coconut candy is \"kẹo dừa\", with kẹo = candy and dừa = coconut. Coconut candy was originally associated with Mo Cay, a small township within the Ben Tre province.\n\nThe production of coconut candy starts with the grating of fresh coconut flesh. The grated flesh is then pressed to extract coconut milk and coconut cream. The next step is the addition of malt syrup and sugar to this mixture of coconut milk and cream. The ratio of the various ingredients is a closely guarded secret of individual coconut candy manufacturers. The mixing process is often entrusted only to family members of the factory owner. Slight variations in the ingredient ratios can lead to very different texture and taste in the final product.\n\nThe mixture is then heated to a very high temperature in large woks over fires generated by the burning of coconut shells. While being heated, the mixture is stirred continuously to ensure even heat distribution. Traditionally, this stirring process was done manually with large wooden paddles. In larger modern manufacturing facilities, these paddles have been replaced by electric motors. The mixture eventually caramelises to a thicker texture. Recognising when the mixture has been cooked to the right level is more of an art than an exact science. While it is still hot and soft, the thickened mixture is then stringed out into moulds and allowed to cool. The final step sees the candy strings cut into rectangular lozenges, then wrapped and packaged.\n\nTraditionally, coconut candy is wrapped in two layers of wrappings. The inner layer is edible rice paper, and the outer layer is paper soaked in vegetable oil. These measures were necessary to stop the candy from sticking to the paper wrapping. Larger manufacturers now use heat-sealed foil paper, which does not stick to the candy.\n\nBen Tre currently has over one hundred coconut candy manufacturers, making up thirty percent of local enterprises. However, the market is dominated by a handful of well-known brands, with most manufacturers producing candy under licence for these brands. Coconut candy is sold throughout Vietnam. It is also exported to other Asian countries, Australia, Europe and North America.\n"}

{"id": "42456709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42456709", "title": "Mu (shaman)", "text": "Mu (shaman)\n\nMu 무 is an ancient Korean word defining a shaman, that is to say intermediary between spirits, gods and men, in the Korean traditional religion. Korean shamans hold rituals called \"gut\" (literally \"good\") for the welfare of the individuals and the society. In modern Korea different terms are used to define shamans, including mudang (mostly for females), baksu (only for males), tangol (for hereditary shamans) and musogin (\"people who do shamanism\", used in the context of organised shamanism).\n\nThe Korean word 무 \"mu\" is related to the Chinese 巫 \"wu\", which defines shamans of either sex. Korean shamanic terminology has, however, at least a partial origin in Siberian languages. Already in records from the Yi dynasty, \"mudang\" has a prevalent usage. \"Mudang\" itself is explained in relation to Chinese characters, as originally referring to the \"hall\", 堂 \"tang\", of a shaman. A different etymology, however, explains \"mudang\" as stemming directly from the Siberian term for female shamans, \"utagan\" or \"utakan\".\n\n\"Mudang\" is used mostly, but not exclusively, for female shamans. Male shamans are called by a variety of names, including \"sana mudang\" (literally \"male \"mudang\"\") in the Seoul area, or \"baksu mudang\", also shortened \"baksu\" (\"doctor\", \"healer\"), in the Pyongyang area. According to some scholars, \"baksu\" is an ancient authentic designation of male shamans, and locutions like \"sana mudang\" or \"baksu mudang\" are recent coinages due to the prevalence of female shamans in recent centuries. \"Baksu\" may be a Korean adaptation of terms loaned from Siberian languages, such as \"baksi\", \"balsi\" or \"bahsih\".\n\nThe theory of a Siberian origin of Korean shamanic terminology is more reasonable than theories which explain such terminology as originating in Chinese, given that Chinese culture influenced Korea only at a relatively recent stage of Korean history. Likely, when Koreans adopted Chinese characters they filtered their previously oral religious culture through the sieve of Chinese culture. Another term, mostly used in contemporary South Korea in the context of shamanic associations, is \"musogin\", which means \"people who do shamanism\".\n\nThe work of the \"mu\" is based on the holistic model, which takes into consideration, not only the whole person, but the individual's interaction with his environment, thus both the inner and outer world. The soul is considered the source of life breath, and any physical illness is considered to be inextricably linked with sickness of the soul. Illness of the mind has its cause in soul loss, intrusion or possession by malevolent spirits.\n\nThe \"gut\", rites practised by Korean shamans, have gone through a number of changes since the Silla and Goryeo periods. Even during the Joseon dynasty, which established Korean Confucianism as the state religion, shamanic rites persisted. In the past, such rites included agricultural rites, such as prayers for abundant harvest. With a shift away from agriculture in modern Korea, agricultural rites have largely been lost and modern-day shamans are more focused on the spiritual issues of urban life.\n\nIn all the myths which figuratively explain the role of the shamans, it is implied that they are media, intermediaries, of higher forms of being. They are not ordained institutionally, but receive ordination from gods, spirits or human ghosts.\n\nGenerally, these myths explain that shamans, whom in the most recent history of Korea are regarded as belonging to the lowest class of society (\"cheonmin\" 천민), have a forgotten divine or princely nature, often coming from a blood lineage that may be traced back to the early founders of civilisation. Further features of these myths are symbols of divine presence, such as the holy mountain and the holy tree, and tragic or painful experiences.\n\nThe bear is an animal often present in such myths, with parallels in the mythologies of Siberia.\n\nIn a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to a mother goddess associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the \"Heavenly King\". She has different names according to different regions and associated mountains: \"Sungmo\" (\"Holy Mother\"), \"Daemo\" (\"Great Mother\"), \"Jamo\" (\"Benevolent Mother\"), \"Sinmo\" (\"Divine Mother\"), \"Nogo\" (\"Olden Maiden\"), and others. In other myths she is a mortal princess who is later turned into a goddess.\n\nThese myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the \"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\" on the top of a mountain. The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first \"mudang\". According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the Silla period, when Buddhism and influences from China had already penetrated the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region. In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland. The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people. Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers. The first \"mudang\" were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the \"mudang\" are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes.\n\nIn the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as \"Chil Kongju\" (the \"Seventh Princess\"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king. The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and cast it into a pond, but she was rescued by a Dragon King sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters. Names of the goddess in other local traditions \"Pali Kongju\" and \"Kongsim\". In the tradition of Jeju Island, where there are more male \"baksu\" than female \"mudang\", the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans.\n\nDangun is traditionally considered to be the son of \"Hwanin\", the \"Heavenly King\", and founder of the Korean nation. This myth is reputed to be older than that of the mother goddess. Myths similar to that of Dangun are found in Ainu and Siberian cultures.\n\nThe myth starts with prince \"Hwanung\" (\"Heavenly Prince\"), son of \"Hwanin\". The prince asked his father to grant him governance over Korea. Hwanin accepted, and Hwanung was sent to Earth bearing three Heavenly Seals and accompanied by three thousand followers. The prince arrived under the holy tree of sandalwood (\"Sintansu\" 신단수, 神檀樹) on the holy mountain, where he founded his holy city.\n\nAt the time of his reign, \"Ungnyeo\" or \"Ungnye\" (웅녀, 熊女)—who was a she-bear—and a tiger were living in a cave near the holy city, praying earnestly that their wish to become part of mankind might be fulfilled. \"Ungnyeo\" patiently endured weariness and hunger, and after twenty-one days she was transformed into a beautiful woman, while the tiger ran away for it could not tolerate the effort. The woman \"Ungnyeo\" was overjoyed, and visiting the sandalwood city she prayed that she might become the mother of a child.\n\nUngnye's wish was fulfilled, so that she became the queen and gave birth to a prince who was given the royal name of \"Dangun\", the \"Sandalwood King\". Dangun reigned as the first human king of Korea, giving to his kingdom the name of Joseon, \"Land of the Morning Calm\".\n\nAccording to some scholars, the name \"Dangun\" is related to the Siberian \"Tengri\" (\"Heaven\"), while the bear is a symbol of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Later in the myth, Dangun becomes the \"Sansin\", the \"Mountain God\" (metaphorically of civilising growth, prosperity).\n\nKorean shamans may be classified into two categories: ❶ \"sessǔmu\" or \"tangol\" (당골), people who are shamans and have the right to perform rites by family lineage; and ❷ \"kangshinmu\", people who become shamans through an initiation ceremony. Hereditary shamans were historically concentrated in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, while initiated shamans were found throughout the entire peninsula but were peculiar to the northern half, the contiguous areas of China inhabited by Koreans, and the central regions along the Han River.\n\n\"Kangshinmu\" (강신무; 降神巫) are historically found throughout Korea, but they are peculiar to the central and northern regions of the peninsula and the lands of modern-day China contiguous to the northern part of the peninsula. The essential characteristic of the \"kangshinmu\" is that they acquire their status by being \"chosen\" and possessed by a god. There are two subtypes of \"kangshinmu\": ① General \"mudang\" and ② \"myǒngdu\".\n\nA person becomes a \"kangshinmu\" undergoing a period of \"shinbyeong\" (神病), \"divine illness\". The possession by the god is said to be accompanied by physical pain and psychosis. Believers assert that the \"divine illness\" may not be healed through medical treatments, but only through the full communion with the spirit.\n\n\"Mudang\" are shamans who are possessed by a god or a spirit, called a \"momju\". They perform fortune telling using spiritual powers derived from their possession, and lead \"gut\" rituals involving song and dance. A sub-type of \"mudang\" is the \"sǒnmudang\" or \"posal\", who are thought to have acquired power through spiritual experience, but are still not worthy of holding an orthodox \"gut\". Many male shamans, \"baksu\", belong to this category.\n\n\"Myǒngdu\" differ from the general \"mudang\" in that they channel the spirit of a dead person, usually a young child related to the \"myǒngdu\" himself, rather than a god, and invite such spirits to take residence into shrines set up in their homes. \"Myǒngdu\" are found primarily in the Honam region of Korea.\n\n\"Seseummu\" (세습무; 世襲巫), found in the area south of the Han River, receive their status as shamans by family bloodline. There are two subtypes of \"seseummu\": ① \"Shimbang\" and ② \"tangol\".\n\n\"Shimbang\" are similar to initiated shamans, because the relationship with a god and spiritual experience are important elements in their tradition, though the right to conduct ceremonies is hereditary. Furthermore, \"shimbang\" differ from \"kangshimu\" because their bodies are not actually possessed by the god and led to celebrate the \"gut\" rite. Rather, \"shimbang\" contact the god through a medium (\"mujǒmgu\") and do not enter in full identification with the god. Endly, \"Shimbang\" do not set up and keep shrines.\n\n\"Tangol\" are a type of shaman found predominantly in the southernmost regions of the Korean peninsula, especially in Yeongnam (Gyeongsang) and Honam area (Jeolla). Each one of the \"tangol\" families of Honam had districts of influence (\"tangolpan\") in which they had the exclusive right to perform \"gut\" rites. Rituals performed by \"tangol\" involve song and dance to entertain a god or goddess. Both the rights of succession and the ceremonies have been systematised, so that they now bear the characteristics of a religious institution. Unlike other types of Korean shamans, \"tangol\" do not receive a particular god as part of an initiation ceremony and may therefore work with a variety of gods. They do not keep shrines in their homes.\n\n\n"}

Blumenthal began work upon the recipe in 1993, and eventually developed the three-stage cooking process for their preparation. The preparation process involves the chips first being simmered and then cooled and drained of water using a sous-vide technique or by freezing, deep fried at and again cooled, and finally deep fried again at The result is what Blumenthal calls \"chips with a glass-like crust and a soft, fluffy centre\".\n\nBlumenthal said he was \"obsessed with the idea of the perfect chip\", and described how, from 1992 onwards, he worked on a method for making \"chips with a glass-like crust and a soft, fluffy centre\".\n\nHe researched the starch content of different varieties of potato and experimented with drying chips by microwaving, desiccating or even individually pinpricking them. Eventually Blumenthal developed the three-stage cooking process generally known as triple-cooked chips, which he identifies as \"the first recipe I could call my own\".\n\nPreviously, the traditional practice for cooking chips was a two-stage process, in which chipped potatoes were fried in oil first at a relatively low temperature to soften them and then at a higher temperature to crisp up the outside. Heston's recipe involves simmering the potatoes first in water for 20–30 minutes until they are almost falling apart and have developed lots of little cracks across the surface, at which point they are drained and as much moisture as possible is expelled by placing them in either a freezer or sous-vide machine. This additional stage is designed to achieve three objectives. First, cooking the potatoes gently in water helps ensure they acquire a properly soft texture. Second, the cracks that develop in the chips provide places for oil to collect and harden during frying, making them crunchy. Third, thoroughly drying out the chips drives off moisture that would otherwise keep the crust from becoming crisp. Blumenthal describes moisture as the \"enemy\" of crisp chips.\n\nThe second of the three stages is frying the chips at for approximately 5 minutes, after which they are cooled once more in a freezer or sous-vide machine before the third and final stage: frying at for approximately 7 minutes until crunchy and golden. The second stage of low-temperature frying is as essential as the first, according to Heston, as it makes \"any starch left in the surface cells dissolve and combine to create a rigid outer layer that can withstand the higher temperature of the final frying\". This second stage is time-consuming, he acknowledges, but must not be omitted. \"A single frying at a high temperature leads to a thin crust that can easily be rendered soggy by whatever moisture remains in the chip’s interior.\"\n\nOther chefs, such as Joël Robuchon, had previously used such a method of cooking chips in simmering water before subjecting them to a two-stage frying.\n\nVariations include using a refrigerator to cool the chips in between cooking times and the use of different temperatures, such as for the first cooking and for the second. Triple Cooked Chips cooked in duck fat is another variation. Various cultivars of potato are used, such as sebago, Rooster and Maris Piper.\n\nFirst served at The Fat Duck in 1995, triple-cooked chips have since become a standard feature in restaurants.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" described Blumenthal's dish as \"arguably his most influential culinary innovation\", and felt that it gave the chip \"a whole new lease of life\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The limoncello was introduced in 1999, and is based on a 100-year-old Pallini family recipe. It is imported and distributed in the US by Castle Brands Inc (New York, NY).\n\nNicola Pallini (b. 1851) was a prominent merchant in Antrodoco, a town in the Abruzzi region of Italy. His businesses included coal imports, banking, chesnut farms, and general stores, for which he produced wine and various cordials.\n\nIn 1922, the family moved the business to Rome. There it expanded its liquor production, finding success with Mistra', an anise-based liqueur. This is where they began producing handcrafted Romana Sambuca.\n\nIn 1962, Giorgio and Nicola Pallini (Virgilio's sons) foresaw the growth potential of Romana Sambuca and decided to move the company out of the centre of Rome to a larger, modern facility, where it remains today.\n\nLiving in New York in the 1970s, Virgilio Pallini Jr (current President) negotiated distribution in the US.

The lemons arrived on the coast hundreds of years ago, carried by sailors from the Middle East. They have low acid levels and a delicate flavor, as well as a thick peel, which make them ideal for the production of limoncello.\n\nThe lemons are handpicked, peeled and shipped to the production facility in Rome, where the lemon zest is steeped in neutral alcohol derived from sugar beets, making it the most suitable for liquors. This infusion process releases the oils in the zest into the alcohol, which imparts the lemon flavor. Beet sugar is then added to the infused alcohol, and it is bottled and shipped worldwide.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Pallini Limoncello received a 92 from the Beverage Tasting Institute, as well as a 91 from the Ultimate Spirits Challenge, in which the brand was \"highly recommended.\" The brand also received a rating of 90-95 from Wine Enthusiast in 2005.\n\nPallini Raspicello received a rating of 92 points from the Beverage Tasting Institute in 2012, while Pallini Peachello received a rating of 90 points.\n\n"}

{"id": "42662745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42662745", "title": "Chinese salvationist religions", "text": "Chinese salvationist religions\n\nChinese salvationist religions or Chinese folk religious sects are a Chinese religious tradition characterised by a concern for salvation (moral fulfillment) of the person and the society. They are distinguished by egalitarianism, a founding charismatic person often informed by a divine revelation, a specific theology written in holy texts, a millenarian eschatology and a voluntary path of salvation, an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and self-cultivation, and an expansive orientation through evangelism and philanthropy.\n\nSome scholars consider these religions a single phenomenon, and others consider them the fourth great Chinese religious category alongside the well-established Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism. Generally these religions focus on the worship of the universal God, represented as either male, female, or genderless, and regard their holy patriarchs as embodiments of God.\n\n\"Chinese salvationist religions\" (救度宗教 \"jiùdù zōngjiào\") is a contemporary neologism coined as a sociological category and gives prominence to folk religious sects' central pursuit that is the salvation of the individual and the society, in other words the moral fulfillment of individuals in reconstructed communities of sense. Chinese scholars traditionally describe them as \"folk religious sects\" (民间宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\", 民间教门 \"mínjiān jiàomén\" or 民间教派 \"mínjiān jiàopài\") or \"folk beliefs\" (民间信仰 \"mínjiān xìnyǎng\").\n\nThey are distinct from the common indigenous religion of the Han Chinese consisting in the worship of gods and ancestors, although in English language there is a terminological confusion between the two. The 20th-century expression of these folk religious movements has been studied under the definition of \"redemptive societies\" (救世团体 \"jiùshì tuántǐ\"), coined by scholar Prasenjit Duara.\n\nA collective name that has been in use possibly since the late Qing dynasty is \"huìdàomén\" (会道门 \"churches, ways and gates\"), as their names interchangeably use the terms \"huì\" (会 \"church\", \"society\", \"association\", \"congregation\"; when referring to their corporate form), \"dào\" (道 \"way\") or \"mén\" (门 \"gate[way]\", \"door\").\n\nTheir congregations and points of worship are usually called \"táng\" (堂 \"church\", \"hall\") or \"tán\" (坛 \"altar\"). Western scholars often mistakenly identify them as \"Protestant\" churches.\n\nThe Vietnamese religions of \"Minh Đạo\" and Caodaism emerged from the same tradition of Chinese folk religious movements.\n\nA category overlapping with that of the movements of salvation is that of the \"secret societies\" (秘密社会 \"mìmì shèhuì\", or 秘密结社 \"mìmì jiéshè\"), religious communities of initiatory and secretive character, including rural militias and fraternal organisations which became very popular in the early republican period, and often labeled as \"heretical doctrines\" (宗教异端 \"zōngjiào yìduān\").\n\nRecent scholarship has begun to use the label \"secret sects\" (秘密教门 \"mìmì jiàomén\") to distinguish the peasant \"secret societies\" with a positive dimension of the Yuan, Ming and Qing periods, from the negatively viewed \"secret societies\" of the early republic that became instruments of anti-revolutionary forces (the Guomindang or Japan).\n\nMany of these religions are traced to the White Lotus tradition (\"Chinese Maternism\", as mentioned by Philip Clart) that was already active in the Song dynasty; others claim a Taoist legacy and are based on the recovery of ancient scriptures attributed to important immortals such as Lü Dongbin and Zhang Sanfeng, and have contributed to the popularisation of \"neidan\"; other ones are distinctively Confucian and advocate the realisation of a \"great commonwealth\" (\"datong\" 大同) on a world scale, as dreamt of in the Book of Rites. Some scholars even find influences from Manichaeism, Mohism and shamanic traditions.\n\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties many folk religious movements were outlawed by the imperial authorities as \"evil religions\" (邪教 \"xiéjiào\"). With the collapse of the Qing state in 1911 the sects enjoyed an unprecedented period of freedom and thrived, and many of them were officially recognised as religious groups by the early republican government.\n\nThe founding of the People's Republic in 1949 saw them suppressed once again, although since the 1990s and 2000s the climate was relaxed and some of them have received some form of official recognition. In Taiwan all the still existing restrictions were rescinded in the 1980s.\n\nFolk religious movements began to rapidly revive in mainland China in the 1980s, and now if conceptualised as a single group they are said to have the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions of China taken together. Scholars and government officials have been discussing to systematise and unify this large base of religious organisations; in 2004 the State Administration of Religious Affairs created a department for the management of folk religions. In the late 2015 a step was made at least for those of them with a Confucian identity, with the foundation of the Holy Confucian Church of China which aims to unite in a single body all Confucian religious groups.\n\nMany of the movements of salvation of the 20th and 21st century aspire to become the repository of the entirety of the Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism, advocating an \"Eastern solution to the problems of the modern world\", or even interacting with the modern discourse of an Asian-centered universal civilisation.\n\nThe Chinese folk religious movements of salvation are mostly concentrated in northern and northeastern China, although with a significant influence reaching the Yangtze River Delta since the 16th century. The northern provinces have been a fertile ground for the movements of salvation because of a number of reasons: ① firstly, popular religious movements were active in the region already in the Han dynasty, and they deeply penetrated local society; ② secondly, northern provinces are characterised by social mobility around the capital and weak traditional social structure, thus folk religious movements of salvation fulfill the demand of individual searching for new forms of community and social network.\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012, approximately 2.2% of the population of China, which is around 30 million people, claim to be members of folk religious sects. The actual number of followers may be higher, about the same as the number of members of the five state-sanctioned religions of China if counted together. In Taiwan, recognised folk religious movements of salvation gather approximately 10% of the population as of the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is typical of the Apulian and Lucanian cuisines and is often compared to spaghetti alla chitarra due to its ultimate shape, though the processing for making troccoli does traditionally not require the so-called \"chitarra\", which in turn is a distinctive tool in the preparation of \"spaghetti alla chitarra\".\n\nTroccoli is a spaghetti-like pasta which is traditionally processed by the so-called \"troccolaturo\" or \"troccolo\", a grooved rolling pin which cuts the dough into regular strips about 3–5 mm thick (0,11811-0,19685 inches): as a result of the pressure employed on the dough, the cross section of each strip will be either square or slightly oval, according to the shape of the grooves themselves (they can be either flat or pointy).\n\nAs for its ingredients, troccoli is basically made with durum wheat flour and water, with the optional addition of a few eggs - that is why it is sometimes associated with tagliolini and egg pasta as a whole.\n\nThe \"troccolaturo\" or \"troccolo\" is an old kitchen utensil in use for several centuries in Italy. In his \"Opera dell'arte del cucinare\", published in 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi mentions this tool under the name of \"ferro da maccheroni\" (\"macaroni iron\") and shows an engraving that clearly lends us an idea of what this kitchenware looked like in ancient times. It was basically a grooved rolling pin made of metal, though the metal was gradually replaced by hardwoods and today this tool comes in both materials, especially in beech wood or bronze.\n\nAs for the etymology of nouns like \"troccolo\" or \"troccolaturo\", they originate from Latin \"torculum\" (Standard Italian \"torchio\" or, in times past, \"torcolo\"), which ultimately comes from the verb \"torquere\" (\"to press\") and refers to the press in the context of food processing: in this case, the press is manual rather than mechanical and is basically a rudimentary utensil to process food, especially suitable for homemade pasta. Troccoli itself is likely named after this kitchenware, though it might as well have a separate origin and refer to Latin \"torculum\" as the product of this food processing method, namely a pasta chip or \"truciolo di pasta\" in Italian: in this case, \"troccolo\" (here intended as singular for \"troccoli\") would be a dialect variation of \"truciolo\", as these words are actually cognates (i.e. they both originate from \"torculum\").\n\n"}

The eggs are boiled slowly in water mixed with salt, soy sauce, shallot skins, teak leaf and other spices. Due to its origins, it bears striking similarities with Chinese tea eggs. However, instead of black tea, this version uses leftover shallot skins, teak leaves or guava leaves as dark brownish coloring agents.\n\nThe term \"pindang\" refer to the cooking process of boiling the ingredients in salt together with certain spices that contains tannin, usually soy sauce, shallot skin, guava leaves, teak leaves, tea or other spices common in Southeast Asia. This gives the food a dark brown color and lasts longer compared to plainly boiled eggs, thus \"pindang\" is an Indonesian traditional method to preserve food, usually employed for fish and eggs. The technique is native to Java and Sumatra. Other preserving method includes \"asin\" or cured and dried in salt, and \"dendeng\" which is cured and dried in sugar, \"acar\" (pickling), and also \"asap\" (smoked).\n\nToday, the telur pindang is widely spread throughout Indonesian archipelago, however it is found more prevalent in Javanese cuisine of Central and East Java, and also South Sumatra. Despite sharing similarities with Chinese tea eggs that employs tea leaves, this Indonesian version favours the use of teak leaves, guava leaves or spared shallots skin instead. The use of teak leaf as coloring agent might suggest its Javanese origin, since Java is famous for its teak wood for centuries. The teak leaf is also used to give reddish color in Yogyakarta's \"gudeg\", or even as dyeing material in traditional Javanese batik-making. Indonesian cuisine favour the use of shallots than common onion, and subsequently the peeled shallot skins are usually collected and spared as key ingredient to make pindang eggs later.\n\nThe telur pindang is often served as part of \"tumpeng, nasi kuning\" or \"nasi campur\". In Yogyakarta, telur pindang often served with nasi \"gudeg\" or just steamed rice. It is also part of Chinese Indonesian \"Lontong Cap Go Meh\". Those dishes, the \"tumpeng, nasi kuning,\" and \"lontong cap go meh,\" are important ceremonial dishes for each respective cultures, since eggs are traditionally symbolize fertility, regeneration and luck.\n\nTelur pindang in Malaysia is most popular in Johor, the southern-most state in Peninsular Malaysia. The true origins of the dish is unclear, however the cuisine most likely originated from Chinese merchants and settlers who came to the country in the 19th century through the once independent sultanate, having significant similarities to tea eggs. Another possible theory suggests that it was probably brought by Javanese immigrants instead, that settled in Johor about a century ago. The recipe might have caught on due to its preserved nature. With Johor being a hub of international trade, it would be useful to the many merchants at sea who can benefit from such an easily stored food item that lasted for weeks.\n\nThe common ingredients of telur pindang are shallot skins, tamarind, fennel, coriander, soysauce, and various leaves such as guava leaves or mangosteen leaves, although different recipes have different mixes of these ingredients or even additional ingredients, giving it a unique flavor. The notable difference between Malaysian and Indonesian telur pindang is the use of teak leaves, which are replaced with other leaves in most traditional Malaysian telur pindang recipes.\n\nTelur pindang has a deep cultural heritage within Johorean, and in turn Malaysian, society. However, the daily use of telur pindang is now far more uncommon today due to its complicated and time-consuming method of cooking, restricted to mostly festivities or commercial sale. In turn, this creates an appreciation for the cuisine, regarded as an important part of Malay tradition.\n\n"}

{"id": "42858795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42858795", "title": "Kibi dango (Okayama)", "text": "Kibi dango (Okayama)\n\nA , is a type of wagashi sweet or snack with an eponymous reference to Kibi-no-kuni, an old province roughly coincident with today's Okayama Prefecture. It is made by forming gyūhi, a sort of soft mochi, into flat round cakes. Glutinous rice, starch, syrup and sugar are the basic ingredients. It is manufactured by some fifteen confectioners based in Okayama City. While perhaps originally made from \"kibi\" (proso millet), the modern recipe uses little or no millet, and substantively differs from of yore, famous from the Japanese heroic folk tale of Momotarō or \"Peach Boy\"; nevertheless, \"Kibi dango\" continues to be represented as being the same as the folk hero Peach Boy's dumpling.\n\nThe simplistic, and widely disseminated notion regarding its invention is that it was developed in the early Ansei era (ca. 1856) by the confectioner Kōeidō, but a local historian has traced a more elaborate multi-phased history in which the founding of this wagashi shop and the development of the modern recipe is pushed to a number of years later. Some hypotheses trace its pre-history to the dumpling (or some other food item) served at the Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama.\n\nThe resident deity of this shrine, Kibitsuhiko, is a legendary ogre-slayer, claimed to be the true identity of Momotarō, especially by Okayama locals. The theory originated in the 1930s, and since then there has been concerted effort in the region to promote the folk hero Momotarō as a local of Kibi Province, and his dumplings as \"Kibi dango\" by default.\n\nThere are irreconcilably differing accounts of the dates and sequences of events regarding the invention. The standard curt explanation is that this specialty dessert was first invented by the confectioner during the early Ansei era (1854–). This purveyor later split into two brands, and which remain to this day. Takeda is the family name of the original business. The current proprietors give a more complex account of the first origins, but local historians uncovered an even more convoluted history.\n\nThe official line version, endorsed by the Kōeidō Honten, is that the family ran a ceramics merchant named \"\" for 7 generations running, until it switched business to that of a confectioner in 1856, changing the shop name to \"Kōeidō\". According to this scenario, around 1856, Takeda Hanzō (半蔵), the retired predecessor of the family ceramics shop, was one of the three Okayama townsmen who collectively devised the new recipe that was somehow an improvement over the steamed millet dumpling \"rectangularly shaped like kakimochi, which did not keep well, and was eaten with red bean paste or with sauce poured on top,\" which was a common staple wherever the crop was harvested.\n\nContrary to this, a handful of desk references place \"Kōeidō\" already in existence at the time of c. 1856 invention, crediting the shop's first proprietor Takeda Asajirō (浅次郎) rather than the elder Hanzō for the recipe. These sources claim that the tea ceremony connoisseur named , who was then senior advisor (karō) to the feudal lord of the local Okayama Castle (Ikeda clan) gave Asajirō crucial advise leading to the recipe innovation, and that the millet dumplings served at Kibitsu Shrine inspired hint.\n\nBut the time frame seems to be wrong. Asajirō himself wrote that during his watch, the kibi dango changed shape from the rectangular to round shapes, and this happened sometimes after the Meiji Era was ushered in (1868-). The tea ceremony expert in question, referred to in these sources as only called himself by this art name in his retirement, from 1869 to his death in 1886.\n\nMore meticulous accounts of what transpired, uncovered by the labors of local historians, suggest that indeed, several years passed between 1856 and the time Asajirō became successor to this business, changing the recipe.\n\nA detailed chronology was stitched together by local historian Oka Chōhei based on articles in print and additionally conducted interviews, is as follows:\n\nIn the year 1855 (Ansei 2) three commoners from the town around Okayama Castle (now Okayama City) collaborated and devised a reddish rectangular confection rather like kakimochi as accompaniment to serving tea. Among the three was , resident of Furugyōchō and Karatsu ware peddling agent fronting for the samurai clan (\"myōdai\"). This old man Hanro was the grandfather , and a member of the Takeda family who later founded Kōeidō. This snack was for pastime purposes only and not meant for business, but since leaving it nameless did not seem fitting, they pondered until they struck up the idea of borrowing the province name and calling it , something of a nonce word. This much is given in an article by a Meiji era popular culture researcher, entitled .\n\nAlthough this dessert was initially only distributed among friends and family, it was eventually offered for sale and gained popularity. Takeda Hanzō (died in 1901 at age 81) then outfitted a shop named after his own art name, and had his mistress sell the Kibi-dan-go. Although Oka also heard dissenting reports that this Kibi-dan-go was millet dumpling with a \"rather long thin thread of red bean paste poured over it,\" he was skeptical, and concluded it was in fact \"probably kakimochi\". After Hanzō's mistress died, the Sōkandō business was passed over to Hanzō's relative Takeda Asajirō, the founder of Kōeidō.\n\nIt was not until Takeda Asajirō's takeover that the merchandise became the present-day soft gyūhi product packed in boxes, according to the memory of Nishio Kichitaro, founder of the , for many years the only newspaper of the area. Asajirō's own book too states that it was only after the Meiji Restoration (1867-) that his product changed from the rectangular items of the past to the round cakes as large as two go stones, sold in boxed in sets of 30 or 50.\nIn 1885 (Meiji 18) Kōeidō's Kibi dango was presented to Emperor Meiji who was visiting the area, and he wrote a waka poem praising it, which translated to \"Kibi dango such that no two such exists in Japan / Indeed such is the taste and it has earned its name, this\". The sellers subsequently began to enclose leaflets with this poem printed inside its boxes.\n\nThere are a number of sources attempting to trace the pre-history of the Kibi dango to some food, or custom, or legend associated with Okayama's Kibitsu Shrine, though each line of inquiry differs from one another.\n\nAs aforestated, there had been a piece of anecdote or rumor (perhaps collected in the Meiji era), claiming that the Kibi dango recipe was created on suggestion of former feudal advisor Igi San'ensai, and that he used the millet dumplings served at Kibitsu Shrine as hint.\n\nThe founder of Kōeido (the purveyors of Kibi dango) authored a travel guide in 1895, in which he claimed that Kibitsuhiko rolled with his own hand some kibi dango to give to Emperor Jimmu who stopped at Takayama Palace in Okayama. This episode is anachronistic and hence faulty, but illustrates that the manufacturer was attempting to associate their product with this deity at a relatively early juncture.\n\nFrom modern academia, one theory notes that Japanese shrines have a custom called whereby food offerings to the resident deitiy would afterwards be consumed. Kibitsu Shrine observed this custom in the early Edo Period, and this was the origin of the Kibi dango, according to Okayama University professor in his book on the history of the prefecture.\n\nOn the other hand, , also of Okayama University, who had the ancestral line of the shrine's priests (kannushi) in his family background, conjectured that the sweet was an adaptation of the , a specialty of the Miyauchi and Itakura hamlets in the (i.e., the community served by Bitchū-Takamatsu Station) which is in the environs of the shrine.\n\nKōeidō's Kibi dango's national fame came after the private San'yō Railway came into operation through its city. This new line connected the Kobe (which was the terminus of the state-run line) to Okayama in 1891, and extended the line to Hiroshima just before the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894. Since the Daihonei (Imperial General Headquarters) was located in Hiroshima, all the troops were amassed here and shipped in and out of (Hiroshima Harbor). Those residing farther east and serving the war by necessity rode the San'yō line, and passed the Okayama station in transit. Kōeidō, which been peddling their goods in Okayama Station now expanded business to the Hiroshima Station, and capitalized on the soldiers and send-off parties buying the Kibi dango as souvenirs.\n\nIt was at this time that Kōeidō began its marketing strategy connecting its product to \"Peach Boy\". Reputedly, proprietor Takeda Asajirō himself dressed up as Momotarō and held up the \"Nippon-ichi (number one in Japan)\" banner to pitch sales, and persons dressed up as oni ogre handed out leaflets. The peddling at the station was so successful, that a lady from Yamawaki (Sangetsudō), who also had Takeda Hanzō connections, was recruited to help. By April 1897 (Meiji 30), there were 12 establishments that billed themselves as the \"original\" (\"honbo\", \"'honke\", 'ganso\") Kibi dango sellers.\n\nA 1901 article by folk historian stated that while\"Kōeidō used millet, mochi, and sugar as ingredients, Sangetsudō used mochi and sugar,\" and that Sangetsudō stressed the fact they did not use millet and was different item than \"Japan's number one kibi dango.\"\n\nAs already described, during the Meiji Era, the Kibi dango business had already appropriated the \"number one\" slogan from the Peach Boy folktale, and was using the hero's costume to promote sales. But eventually, the entire Okayama prefecture began to promote the Kibi dango and Momotarō as inextricably connected part of their prefectural heritage. This was mostly a post-World War II phenomenon, Okayama had not been the foremost contender as the home of the Peach Boy (Inuyama, Aichi and Kinashi in Takamatsu on Shikoku previously laying strong claims). However, that changed with the advent of amateur ethnographer (1897-1973), (\"The True History of Momotarō,\" 1930), which claimed that the Momotarō folktale was an adaption of legend \"Kibitsuhiko no Mikoto no Ura Taiji\", which recounts Kibitsuhiko's suppression of a local oni (ogre) named . This ogre-slayer Kibitsuhiko, as his name suggests, is the deified being venerated in Kibitsu Shrine, Okayama.\n\nNowadays, the Momotarō theme is used in train station advertisement, as well as being found in packaging of the kibi dango products. Since 1993, the Kōeidō Honten has sold the \"Ganso Kibidango\", featuring Momotarō character design by children's book illustrator Tarō Gomi.\n\nAn assortment of varieties has been developed, such as \"'mascatto kibi dango\" (Muscat grape syrup filling), \"momo kibi dango\" (white peach syrup filling), \"kinako kibi dango\" (sprinkled with kinako or dry soybean powder), and chocolate flavored varieties.\n\n\n"}

Whitbread's superior capitalisation and distribution network allowed it to take the Boddingtons brand nationwide. Boddingtons had been in decline before the Whitbread takeover, and although it retained an almost \"cult\" following within its Manchester heartland, only 5 per cent of sales were outside the North West.\n\nWhitbread transformed the brand from regional to national, expanding production from 200,000 to 850,000 barrels a year between 1989 and 1995. By 1993 the cask version was outsold only by Tetley and John Smith's, and the majority of sales were outside of the North West. By 1994 it was the fourth-highest selling bitter brand in the country. The canned variant was distributed nationwide from 1990 and was the highest-selling canned bitter in the UK from 1992 until 2000. The beer was officially exported overseas from 1993, initially to Canada. The rise in sales of the beer coincided with the elevation of Manchester from \"city of dark, beaten mills to the cultural magnet of Madchester\". Manchester and the North of England were now fashionable in the public consciousness and rejuvenated from an image of industrial decay. Whitbread chief executive Peter Jarvis commented in 1995 that: \n\nSuccess was attributed to an excellent marketing campaign, and being the first canned ale to be sold with a widget after Guinness. In 1997 Boddingtons sales peaked, and 1998 saw a drop in sales of 10 per cent. Boddingtons had been turned into: \"a fashion product ... and as with all fashion products, the drinkers moved on\". Despite this setback, in 1998-1999 Boddingtons' share of the UK ale market grew to 4.9 per cent, and sales grew by 7.3 percent during 1999-2000.\n\nIn May 2000 the Whitbread Beer Company was acquired by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time one in eight barrels of Boddingtons was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery kegging facility closed in February 2003 with the loss of 50 jobs. In August 2003, amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and the changes were reversed.\n\nIn September 2004 the owners (now known as InBev) announced plans to close the Strangeways Brewery and move most production from Manchester to Magor in South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire, with the loss of 60 jobs. Boddingtons cask ale production, which accounted for less than 10 per cent of output, was moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side. Production ended in February 2005 and the brewery was demolished in 2007.\n\nIn May 2010 it was speculated in \"The Times\" that InBev (known as Anheuser-Busch InBev from 2008 onwards) would attempt to sell the Boddingtons brand to another brewer after its failed attempt to sell the UK rights to Bass ale. The newspaper was damning of what it perceived as InBev's mismanagement of the brand, which had \"declined under AB InBev's hands. The brand was once a leading part of the old Whitbread Beer Company, but its fortunes had dwindled since the closure in 2005 of the Strangeways Brewery.\"\n\nIn 2010 Boddingtons was the sixth-highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom, although sales had dropped by almost three quarters since the takeover by Anheuser–Busch InBev in 2000. In July 2011 AB InBev's UK president Stuart MacFarlane claimed \"We still believe in the brand\" whilst admitting to not advertising the brand for five years, instead reaping the rewards of memories of earlier advertising. Contract brewing of Boddingtons Cask continued until March 2012 when production of the beer ended.\n\nProduction was around 250,000 hectolitres in 2012, with around 80 percent of production destined for the UK market, and around 20 percent destined for export markets such as Taiwan, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2017, Anheuser–Busch InBev announced that it was launching a digital, social, PR and video campaign for Boddingtons featuring Melanie Sykes who had appeared in adverts for the brand in 1997.\n\nBoddingtons has a distinctive straw-golden coloured body with a creamy white head, which is achieved by the addition of nitrogen.\n"}

{"id": "42947963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42947963", "title": "Ordinary of arms", "text": "Ordinary of arms\n\nAn ordinary of arms (or simply an ordinary) is a roll or register of coats of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical ordinaries and charges) grouped together. The purpose of an ordinary is to facilitate the identification of the bearer of a coat of arms from visual evidence alone. \n\nOrdinaries may take a form which is either graphic (consisting of a series of painted or drawn images of shields) or written (consisting of blazons – verbal descriptions – of the coats). Most medieval and early modern manuscript ordinaries were graphic, whereas all the principal modern published ordinaries have been written. A knowledge of the technicalities of blazon is essential for the student hoping to make best use of a written ordinary.\n\nBy extension, ordinaries may also be compiled of other elements of heraldic display, such as crests, supporters or badges.\n\nAlthough ordinaries of arms have been compiled since the 14th century, the actual term seems to have come into use only in the 18th century. The earliest clear attestation is found in Edmondson's \"Complete Body of Heraldry\" of 1780.\n\nThe ordinary appears to have been an English development of the 14th century. No medieval ordinaries are known from continental Europe.\n\nMedieval English ordinaries include \"Cooke's Ordinary\", compiled in c.1340 (644 coats), \"Cotgrave's Ordinary\", also of c.1340 but in blazon (556 coats), and the larger \"Thomas Jenyns' Book\", compiled in c.1398 (1,595 coats). These three are all related, and perhaps derive from a lost progenitor. An independent work is \"William Jenyns' Ordinary\", compiled in c.1360 (1,612 coats). \n\nIn the early 16th century, Thomas Wriothesley, Garter King of Arms, planned a comprehensive painted roll and ordinary of all English arms: this was not completed, but parts of the ordinary survive in what is now known as \"Prince Arthur's Book\" of c.1520. In the second half of the century, Robert Glover, Somerset Herald, drew on a wide range of medieval sources to compile \"Glover's Ordinary\", the fullest and most authoritative ordinary to date. This was assembled in its first form in 1584, and contained some 15,000 coats. At the beginning of the 17th century, Augustine Vincent, Rouge Croix Pursuivant and later Windsor Herald, compiled \"Vincent's Ordinary\", also of about 15,000 shields, drawn in trick.\n\nVersions of Glover's Ordinary, much augmented, were published in Joseph Edmondson's \"Complete Body of Heraldry\" (1780) and in William Berry's \"Encyclopedia Heraldica\" (1828). Cotgrave's Ordinary was published in 1829, edited by Sir Harris Nicolas.\n\nThe principal modern ordinary of British and Irish heraldry, still not entirely superseded, is \"Papworth's \"Ordinary\"\" (1874), or in full \"An Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms belonging to Families in Great Britain and Ireland, forming an extensive Ordinary of British Armorials upon an entirely new plan\", compiled by John Woody Papworth. Papworth began work in 1847, making extensive use of Burke's \"General Armory\" (first published 1842; third edition with supplement 1847), copying its entries – which were arranged alphabetically by surname – onto slips of paper and rearranging them. He published a prospectus in 1857, and began to issue his work in instalments shortly afterwards: nine parts had appeared by 1863, and fourteen by the time of his early death (apparently hastened by his insistent commitment to work on the project) in 1870. By this point the work had proceeded as far as page 696: the remaining 429 pages were edited and brought to completion from Papworth's materials by Alfred William Morant (1828–1881). The \"Ordinary\", containing about 50,000 entries, was published as a complete volume in 1874. It rapidly established itself as a standard work of reference, and was reprinted in 1961, 1977 and 1985.\n\nThe great strength of Papworth's \"Ordinary\" was the rigorousness of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) has remained the basis for all ordinaries published since: there was only one possible place for any particular coat of arms to be entered within it. Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's \"General Armory\" and other secondary sources, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the oddities of the book (and therefore of some of its successors), which resulted in part from Papworth's decision to classify animal charges of all kinds under the primary heading \"Beast\", and birds of all kinds under \"Bird\", is that the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the whole, a point on which the editor had to reassure subscribers while the work was still in progress.\n\nIn 1926 Lt Col George Babington Croft Lyons left a substantial bequest to the Society of Antiquaries to prepare a revised and improved edition of Papworth. Anthony Wagner became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the war years, working in inactive periods of firewatching duties) to assemble material on index cards. However, the task was a large one and progress slow, in part because of Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of primary sources, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid of computer technology, the first volume of what was now entitled the \"Dictionary of British Arms\" appeared in 1992. Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Arms\" for Scotland, edited by Sir James Balfour Paul, Lord Lyon King of Arms, was published in 1893, with a second updated edition appearing in 1903: this includes all arms recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland from its inception in 1672 down to the end of 1901 (5,532 entries, with a name index). A second volume, covering arms entered in the Register from 1902 to 1973 (a further 6,040 entries), was published in 1977: this was edited by David Reid of Robertland, Carrick Pursuivant, and Vivien Wilson.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Scottish Arms from Original pre-1672 Manuscripts\", edited by Eilean Malden, John Malden (sometime Unicorn Pursuivant) and William G. Scott, was published in 2016. This contains both an armory (arranged alphabetically by surname) and an ordinary of some 25,000 coats of arms, drawing on the evidence of medieval rolls of arms and other pre-1672 manuscript sources, but excluding that of seals.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Welsh Arms\", covering Welsh arms, crests, badges and supporters down to c.1630 (about 2,800 entries and a name index) forms the greater part of volume 3 of \"The Development of Welsh Heraldry\" by Michael Powell Siddons, published in 1993. A supplementary ordinary down to c.1700 (a further 1,200 entries) is included in volume 4, published in 2006.\n\n\"A Dictionary of Suffolk Arms\" edited by Joan Corder (an ordinary of arms, containing about 6,700 entries and a name-index) was published by the Suffolk Records Society in 1965. A companion volume by the same editor, \"A Dictionary of Suffolk Crests\" (containing some 25,000 entries for crests, arranged in \"ordinary\" form, together with a name-index), was published by the same society in 1998.\n\nAn important modern unpublished ordinary is the collection known as \"Garter's Ordinaries\", now held at the College of Arms. This was originally compiled by and under the direction of Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms, between 1842 and his death in 1904, and was then donated to the College by his grandson, Gerald Woods Wollaston. At that time it comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Subsequent Garters have added to the series and kept the ordinary up to date by including within it new grants of arms. The ordinary remains in use by the members of the College, both for identifying old coats of arms, and for ensuring that new grants are sufficiently differenced from existing coats.\n\n"}

It is one of the two most popular ways that crab is served in Indonesia, commonly found in coastal cities with abundant seafood, such as Padang, Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, Makassar and Cirebon. Its closest analogue probably is chili crab, however Padang crab uses richer spices.\n\nThe recipe derived from West Sumatran Padang style of seasoning seafood with rich, hot and spicy \"bumbu\" (spice mixture). The ground spice mixture includes shallot, garlic, red chili pepper, bird's eye chili, ginger, turmeric and candlenut. The most popular crab species used in this recipe is mud crab, however sometimes blue crab can also be used.\n\nThe crabs are boiled in hot water until medium done and cut into pieces, the hot water being used in the boiling process will be used as crab broth. The \"bumbu\" ground spices mixture includes garlic, shallot, bird's eye pepper, ginger, turmeric, candlenut and red chili pepper. The ground spice paste is stir fried briefly in palm oil to release its aroma, together with chopped onion, \"salam\" leaf (Indonesian bay leaf) and lemon leaf. Then the crab pieces are mixed with stir fried spice paste together with crab broth, scallion, tomato ketchup, chili sauce, oyster sauce, salt and pepper. Then the sauce is being thickened with beaten eggs. The Padang sauce crab tastes savoury, hot and spicy. Other than crab, the identical Padang sauce is often used in other seafood, such as \"kerang saus Padang\" (clams in Padang sauce).\n\n"}

{"id": "43022445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43022445", "title": "Pu (Taoism)", "text": "Pu (Taoism)\n\nPu is a Chinese word meaning \"unworked wood; inherent quality; simple\" that was an early Daoist metaphor for the natural state of humanity, and relates with the Daoist keyword \"ziran\" (literally \"self so\") \"natural; spontaneous\". The scholar Ge Hong (283-343 CE) immortalized \"pu\" in his pen name \"Baopuzi\" \"Master who Embraces Simplicity\" and eponymous book \"Baopuzi\".\n\n\"Pu\" can be written with either of the variant Chinese characters 樸 or 朴, which are linguistically complex.\n\nBoth 樸 and 朴 are classified as radical-phonetic characters, combining the semantically significant \"tree\" radical (commonly used for writing names of trees and wooden objects) with the phonetic indicators \"pu\" or \"bu\" .\n\nThe Chinese character \"pu\" 樸 was first recorded on Chinese bronze inscriptions from the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE), and the character \"pu\" 朴 was first recorded in Chinese classics from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE).\n\nWhen the People's Republic of China promulgated simplified Chinese characters in 1956, the established variant \"pu\" 朴 (with 6 strokes) was chosen to replace the traditional Chinese character \"pu\" 樸 (with 16 strokes).\n\nOne of the two (c. 168 BCE) Mawangdui silk manuscript versions of the \"Daodejing\", discovered in 1973 by archeologists excavating a tomb, uses a rare textual variant character for \"pu\" 樸: \"wò\" 楃 \"a house tent (esp. with a wooden roof)\", written with the \"tree radical\" and \"wu\" 屋 \"room; house\" phonetic. The \"B\" text, like the received version, uses \"pu\" 樸 8 times in 6 chapters; the \"A\" text uses \"wò\" 楃 6 times in 4 chapters and has lacunae in chapters 19 and 57. The (c. 121 CE) \"Shuowen jiezi\" defines \"wo\" 楃 as \"muzhang\" 木帳 \"wood canopy\", and the (early 3rd century) \"Guangya\" defines it as \"choumu\" 幬幕 \"curtain; cover\". These variant words \"pú\" < *\"phrôk\" 樸 \"unworked wood\" and \"wò\" < *\"ʔôk\" 楃 \"house tent\" are semantically and phonologically dissimilar.\n\nThe comprehensive Chinese character dictionary \"Hanyu Da Zidian\" (1987: 2:1291, 2:1154) lists 2 pronunciations and 8 meanings for the character 樸, and 6 pronunciations and 11 meanings for 朴; which are summarized below.\n\nThe graph 樸 can be read:\n\nThe graph 朴 can be read to mean:\n\nThe \"Erya\", which is the oldest Chinese dictionary, defined \"pu\" 樸 and \"supu\" 樕樸 as \"oak\" names (in \"Explaining Trees\" chapter 14). First, \"pu\" 樸 is defined as \"bao\" 枹 (14:45). Guo Pu's \"Erya\" commentary identified this \"pu\" tree as \"yupu\" 棫樸 \"\"Quercus acutissima\", saw-tooth oak\" (which occurs in the \"Shijing\" below). \"Bao\" 枹 is usually read \"fu\" \"drumstick\", and Guo noted this name \"bao\" denoted \"a kind of oak [樸] that grew in clumps\", and quotes the \"Shijing\" usage as \"baoli\" 枹櫟 instead of \"baoli\" 苞櫟 \"bushy oak\" (see below). The \"Bencao Gangmu\" says there are two varieties of \"hu\" 槲 \"\"Quercus mongolica\", Mongolian oak\", the \"bao\" 枹 is small and grows in clumps while the \"li\" 櫟 is tall and has large leaves. Second, \"supu\" 樕樸 is defined as \"xin\" 心 \"heart; mind\" (14:64). Guo identifies \"supu\" (cf. reverse \"pusu\" 樸樕 in the \"Shijing\" below) as \"husu\" 槲樕 (with \"hu\" 槲 \"Mongolian oak\"), the \"\"Quercus dentata\", daimyo oak\". While \"xin\" \"heart; mind\" is a common Chinese word, this \"Erya\" definition is the only known context in which it names a tree. The \"Yijing\" uses \"xin\" to mean \"thorn; prick\", (tr. Wilhelm 1967:277): \"Among varieties of wood it means those which are firm and have much pith\".\n\nThe \"Shuowen Jiezi\", the first Chinese dictionary of characters, simply defines \"pu\" 朴 as \"mupi\" 木皮 \"tree bark; wood with bark\", and \"pu\" 樸 as \"musu\" 木素 \"plain wood; unworked lumber\" (later meaning \"lignin\" in scientific terminology).\n\nReturning to the central Daoist meaning of \"pu\", \nPas and Leung (1998:351) challenge the stereotyped \"uncarved block\" translation of \"pu\": \"The idea implied in it comes closer to \"wholeness,\" which is also contained in \"uncarved block,\" except that \"uncarved block\" has been reified. As a result, what was an excellent analogy of the Tao has become sterile and counterproductive.\" \nCiting the \"pu\" translations of Séraphin Couvreur (1890:475) \"wood that has not been worked on; simple, without ornament, without disguise\" and Bernhard Karlgren (1923:231) \"wood in its natural state, not worked: rough, plain, natural, simple\"; Pas and Leung conclude, \"it is obvious where the expression \"uncarved block\" came from, but the addition of \"block\" is an interpretation. The term means \"plain wood,\" \"uncarved wood.\"\"\n\nReconstructions of Old Chinese pronunciations have transformed Chinese etymology. Old Chinese reconstructions of \"pu\" or \"bu\" 樸 include: \n\nVictor Mair (1990:138) suggests that \"pu\" < *\"phluk\" 樸 \"unhewn log\" is \"almost certainly related to the English word \"block,\" which probably derives from the Indo-European root \"bhelk\" (beam).\"\n\nAxel Schuessler (2007:418) says the etymology of \"pú\" < *\"phrôk\" \"to trim wood\" could either be an \"aspirated iterative derivation\" from \"bāo\" < *\"prôk\" 剝 \"cut up, peel, pluck\", or \"belong to the homophonous etymon with the basic meaning 'in a natural state, unworked', as in \"pú\" 樸 'in a natural state', 璞 'unworked precious stone'.\"\n\n\"Pu\" occurs in some of the earliest Chinese classics, frequently in Daoist ones.\n\nTwo odes in the \"Shijing\" \"Classic of Poetry\" use \"pu\" 樸 compounds to mean \"an oak\".\n\n\"Pusu\" 樸樕 occurs in Ode 23: \"scrubby oaks\" (Legge 1879:34), \"a clump of oaks\" (Waley 1937:60), \"low shrubby trees\" (Karlgren 1950:13). The Mao commentary describes the \"pusu\" as a 小木 \"small tree\". The \"Erya\" (above) writes this reversible compound as \"supu\" 樕樸.\n\n\"Yupu\" 棫樸 is the name of Ode 238, which records using this tree for firewood: \"the \"yih\" and the \"p'oh\"\" (Legge 1879:442), \"the oak clumps\" (Waley 1937:266, Karlgren 1950:191). Commentaries describe the \"yupu\" as a \"dense and shrubby tree\".\n\nIn addition, Ode 132 has \"baoli\" 苞櫟: \"the bushy oaks\" (Legge 1879:201), \"a clump of oaks\" (Waley 1937:75), \"luxuriant oaks\" (Karlgren 1950:85). The \"Erya\" has \"baoli\" 枹櫟, writing \"bao\" as 枹 \"an oak\" instead of 苞 \"bushy; luxuriant\".\n\nThe \"Shujing\" \"Classic of History\" (\"Zhoushu\" 周書, \"Zicai\" 梓材 \"Chinese catalpa lumber\" section) uses \"pu\" once in the compound \"pozhou\" 樸斫 (\"po\" \"trim unworked wood\" and \"zhuo\" \"hack; chop off\"): \"as in working with the wood of the rottlera, when the toil of the coarser and finer operations has been completed, they have to apply the paint of red and other colours\" (Legge 1899:417), \"It is as when one works on catalpa wood; when he has toiled in trimming and carving it, he should take measures for making it red or green\" (Karlgren 1950:48). Legge notes that \"pu\" means \"the rough fashioning of the work\" and \"zhou\" means \"the fine finish given to it\". Karlgren (1970:313) quotes the Han commentator Ma Rong that \"po\" 樸 denotes \"wood that has not yet been worked into a utensil; unworked wood\", and concludes \"po\" means \"to treat the unworked wood (in the first rough cutting); to trim\" is a variation of the same stem as \"pu\" 樸 \"in a natural state; simple\".\n\nSix \"Daodejing\" chapters use \"pu\" 樸, two of them twice, for a total of 8 occurrences. \n\nChapter 19 parallels the near-synonyms \"su\" \"raw silk; white; plain; simple; quiet\" and \"pu\" 樸 \"unworked wood; plain; simple\", and was the source for Ge Hong's pen-name Baopuzi \"Master who Embraces Simplicity\". \nHolmes Welch (1957:35) describes \"pu\" \"the Uncarved Block\" and \"su\" \"Raw Silk\" as symbols that Laozi used to expound his basic doctrine of \"the return to our original nature\". In modern usage, \"pu\" and \"su\" mean \"plain,\" but originally \"pu\" \"was wood as it came from the tree before man had dressed it\", while \"su\" \"was silk that man had never dyed or painted.\" \n\nChapters 28 and 57 mention simple \"pu\" in reference to \"shengren\" \"sages\", Chapter 15 similarly refers to ancient Daoist adepts and describes \"pu\" as \"dun\" \"sincere; honest; plain\".\nAmong all the \"Daodejing\" occurrences of \"pu\", chapter 28 is the only case in which the transmitted and excavated versions are significantly different – the transmitted text has an extra grammatical particle \"zhi\" 之 \"a possessive marker; a 3rd person pronoun\" after \"yong\" 用 \"use; employ\". Robert G. Henricks (1989:242) explains this small grammatical change between the standard text saying the sage \"yong zhi\" \"uses it\" and the excavated silk text saying \"yong\" \"is used\". The transmitted version 樸散則為器聖人用之則為官長 \"When the uncarved wood is broken up, it is turned into concrete things. But when the sage uses it, he becomes the leading official.\" should be read 樸散則為器聖人用則為官長 \"When uncarved wood is cut up, it's turned into vessels. When the Sage is used, he becomes the Head of Officials.\" D. C. Lau (1989:183) says the traditional passage \"seems to say that when the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels. A vessel is a specialist who is only fitted to be an official. Hence the sage when he makes use of these vessels becomes the lord over the officials.\", but in Mawangdui passage, \"The meaning is very different. The uncarved block is a symbol for the sage. Just as the uncarved block becomes vessels when it shatters so does the sage become the chief of the officials when he allows himself to be employed, and just as the uncarved block is ruined when it becomes useful, so does a sage become ruined when he becomes useful.\" The word \"qi\" 器 \"vessel; utensil\" is translated here as \"tools\", \"concrete things\", \"vessels\", \"specialists\", and \"officials\".\n\nChapters 32 and 37 both address \"houwang\" 侯王 \"feudal lords and kings\" and describe the \"Dao\" as \"wuming\" \"nameless\", while 37 also calls \"pu\" \"nameless\".\nChapter 37 has a minor textual difference between \"buyu\" 不欲 \"not desire\" in the standard version and \"buru\" 不辱 \"not disgrace\" in the Mawangdui version (Henricks 1989:260).\n\nLau (1989:xxx) explains \"pu\" in the \"Daodejing\" primarily means \"the uncarved block is in a state as yet untouched by the artificial interference of human ingenuity and so is a symbol for the original state of man before desire is produced in him by artificial means\".\n\nThe (c. 3rd century CE) \"Heshang Gong\" commentary version of this Daoist text interchangeably writes \"pu\" as both 樸 and 朴. Three chapters (28, 32, 37) use 樸 in both text and commentary, and one (15) uses 朴 in both. One (19) uses 樸 in text and 朴 in commentary, and another (57) uses 朴 in text and 樸 in commentary.\n\nOf nine \"Daodejing\" chapters without 樸 or 朴 in the text, three (3, 38, 41) use 樸 in commentary, and six (17, 64, 68, 71, 80, 81) use 朴. For examples, \n\nWelch (1957:84) paraphrases the \"Daodejing\" relationship among \"pu\", \"de\" \"inherent character; inner power\", and \"wuwei\" \"non-action; non-doing\". Outwardly, one cannot achieve \"de\" \"until you have erased the aggressive patterns etched by society into your nature. You must return to your natural self, to [\"pu\"]. You must discard morality and ambition, for if you keep these you will never be capable of compassion, moderation, and humility. When you discard some of your wishes, you will have them all.\" Inwardly, one performs several cultivations. \"For, to achieve the outward [\"pu\"] you will have to cultivate a [\"wuwei\"] of the mind. And when the mind is quiet, [\"pu\"] will deepen. It will become a faculty for intuitively sensing the order of the universe—the [Dao] that can be named.\"\n\n\"Pu\" occurs 20 times in the (ca. 3rd century BCE) Daoist classic \"Zhuangzi\". The standard \"Zhuangzi\" text writes \"pu\" both with the 16–stroke character 樸 six times in three chapters (9, 13, and 31) and with the 6–stroke variant character 朴 fourteen times in six chapters (7, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20), which evidences the heterogeneous textual origins. For instance, the word \"pubi\" (with \"bi\" 鄙 \"low; mean; vulgar; unsophisticated\") is written both樸鄙 \"crude, mean [heart]\" (chapter 31, tr. Mair 1994:332) and 朴鄙 \"simple and unsophisticated [people]\" (10, tr. Mair 1994:87).\n\nA frequently occurring \"Zhuangzi\" metaphor contrasts returning to \"pu\" 樸 \"unhewn log\" with carving \"qi\" 器 \"vessels\" (which means \"specialist; official\" in \"Daodejing\" 28). \n\nAnother \"Zhuangzi\" chapter uses this term \"fupu\" 復朴 \"return to simplicity\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43024825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43024825", "title": "Boerehaat", "text": "Boerehaat\n\nBoerehaat is an Afrikaans word that means \"ethnic hatred of Boers\", or Afrikaners as they became known after the Second Boer War. The related term \"Boerehater\" () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises Boers or Afrikaners.\n\nThese terms were initially applied to British people perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, in the context of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of \"Boerehaat\" have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term \"Boerehater\" to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and black South Africans.\n\n\"Boerehaat\" is an Afrikaans word meaning hatred of the Boers, or Afrikaners as they became known after the Second Boer War. The related term \"Boerehater\" () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises the Boers, or Afrikaners.\n\nThe disdain of the British people for the Boers was recorded as early as the 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term \"Boer-hater\" was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.\n\nBritish politician James Bryce, writing about the attitude of uitlanders (English-speaking immigrants) towards the Boer authorities in the independent Transvaal Republic during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush following the discovery of gold in 1886, states: \"English became the general spoken tongue not only of Johannesburg, but of the mining districts generally. Hearing nothing but English spoken, seeing nothing all round them that was not far more English than Dutch, though English with a half-colonial, half-American tinge, it was natural that the bulk of the Uitlanders should deem themselves to be in a country which had become virtually English, and should see something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors.\" British critic of imperialism John A. Hobson writes about attitudes towards senior Boer officials: \"Regarding the higher officials, the opinion of all, save the blind Boer-hater, is that they are a fairly competent and fairly honest body of men.\"\n\nAnimosity between the British and the Boers intensified in the run-up to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: \"The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them down here like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew.\"\n\nApproximately 27,000 Boer women and children died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed to the rise of Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era.\n\nDuring the apartheid era, the Afrikaners dominated in number of voters, politics and civil service, while English-speaking white South Africans dominated economically. The Afrikaners separated themselves from the rest of the population, both black people and English-speaking whites. In 1971 sociologist Heribert Adam writes \"the historical friction between the English and Afrikaans-speaking populace is gradually being replaced by class contradictions within the two groups.\" Historical friction was revived and exploited by the ruling National Party for political gain however. In 1973 Edward Feit, professor of political science at the University of Michigan, writes in the \"American Journal of Sociology\": \"Recent political campaigns have shown that the old bogey of \"Boerehaat\" still has its charms for an Afrikaaner majority.\"\n\nThe National Party, under the leadership of B. J. Vorster, appealed to the emotions of Afrikaner voters by depicting English-speaking white citizens as being guilty of \"Boerehaat\". The National Party and its political mouthpiece \"Die Burger\" waged a \"Boerehaat campaign\" during a by-election in Oudtshoorn in 1972, depicting their United Party opposition, once supported by the majority of English-speaking voters, as \"Boerehaters\", and won. The Nationalists also used the term to censure members of the Progressive Federal Party opposition party formed in 1977. After interviewing various South Africans including government officials during the early 1980s, American historian Otto Scott writes: \"This sort of xenophobic solidarity perceived the opposition as Boer haters.\"\n\nWhite South African critics of apartheid, such as liberal politician Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naudé, were labelled unpatriotic \"Boerehaters\" by Nationalists and the Afrikaans press in an attempt to discredit them. White dissidents were also associated with the \"rooi gevaar\" (\"communist threat\"). South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a \"Boerehater\" by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner nationalism and the National Party.\n\nEnglish-speaking film critics were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they be accused of \"Boerehaat\". According to \"The Star\" film critic Robert Greig, \"An apology situation developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want to be accused of \"boerehaat\" (Boer-hater).\" According to film critic Barry Ronge, \"The cries of \"boerehaat\" come from the industry itself when they feel they are not getting 'support'.\"\n\nIn 1995 ANC politician Zola Skweyiya was accused of \"Boerehaat\" by \"Die Burger\" for disrespecting the Afrikaans official language in Parliament. In 1998 Jaap Marais, Afrikaner nationalist leader of the right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party, described the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an exercise in \"Boerehaat\".\n\nIn 2011 South African politician Julius Malema was found guilty of hate speech in the High Court in Johannesburg for repeatedly singing the anti-apartheid protest song \"Shoot the Boer\" at political gatherings. Civil rights organisation AfriForum accused Malema of inciting violence against white South Africans, citing the ongoing spate of farm attacks (the literal meaning of \"Boer\" is \"farmer\"). Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was \"derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful\" to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said \"People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them.\"\n\nIn an incident reminiscent of the National Party's \"Boerehaat\" propaganda campaign during apartheid, ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa urged disgruntled residents of the Limpopo province to vote in the 2014 general election otherwise \"the Boers will come back to control us\". Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder described his remarks as \"primitive scare tactics\" and \"racist and polarising\".\n\nSociologist Michael Neocosmos notes that critics of the ruling ANC can similarly be labelled as \"standing outside the state-defined national consensus\", with for example \"ad hominem\" accusations of racism and disloyalty replacing accusations of \"Boerehaat\" and communist sympathies which are hard to defend.\n\n"}

Despite being banned in favor of monophony (, edinoglasiye, literally \"single-voicing\"), singing the chants one by one consecutively, it persisted for quite some time.\n\nThe tradition polyphony arose in early 16th century when chants transformed from recitative to elaborate singing. At the same time the strict service regimen adopted in monasteries have become norm in ordinary chcurches. As a result the full church service had gradually become extremely long. Polyphony was introduced at the excuse of saving time and stamina of laymen, however it have gradually evolved to an absurd where, according to complaints, up to 6 chants were sung at the same time, with cantors trying to overshout each other.

It was first brewed during the 1950s in Kitwe, Zambia by Max Heinrich, who trained in brewing in Berlin.\n\nThe name Chibuku comes from Max Heinrich's habit of recording all consumers' comments and process changes in a book, and Chibuku is an adaptation of the local word for \"book\" - \"Chi\" is the pre-fix meaning \"language of\", \"buk\" = \"book\", and the terminal \"u\" is because most African nouns tend to end in a euphonic vowel. \nThe shake-shake comes from the ritual of first shaking up the beer before taking the first sip. The beer contains starch, the germ and yeast (all normally removed in lagers and ales) and since the solids settle to the bottom of the carton, it needs to be shaken before sipping.\n\nThe alcohol content in a fresh Chibuku is fairly low starting at about 0.5% ABV on day one, but as fermentation continues in the carton, the longer it is kept before drinking, the stronger it gets. It may achieve 4% ABV before the shelf-life expires after between 4 and 6 days after packaging.\n\nChibuku is a pan-African brand of opaque sorghum beer made by various brewers across Africa. Part of the reason for the success of the brand is the commercial brewing process with systems to ensure a consistent product quality product that is safe for consumers.\n\nChibuku is often the choice of less affluent consumers who can't afford bottled beer, and this may still be the case for many of the consumers in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Botswana. However there are also consumers in the emerging middle class who enjoy the beer as a preference, because of the taste and for the health connotations.\n\nChibuku is now brewed across Africa by various brewers.\n\n"}

The Iteso call it “emugoyo”, the Baganda refer to it as Mugoyo or Omugoyo which means it is mingled.\n\nIn Buganda, omugoyo has been associated with aging women because it is assumed only old women have the patience to prepare it due to the straining process. The common myth about omugoyo in Buganda is that two lovers are not supposed to serve each other omugoyo. It is believed that such an act would extinguish the fire and may even result in a failed relationship.\n\nThe recipe for mugoyo consists of red kidney beans also known as Nambale and sweet potatoes.\n\nThe cooking process is started by boiling dried red kidney beans known as Nambale with salt till tender. The dark purple sweet potatoes are then peeled and steamed in banana leaves till tender. The beans and sweet potatoes are mashed together to form one dish.\n\nMugoyo is prepared over firewood where the smoke from the firewood adds a great taste to the mugoyo during the baking moment known as kubobeeza.

It is a delicacy commonly found in Javanese and Sundanese cuisine of Java, Indonesia, and often consumed as snack. It is similar to lontong, but with stickier texture and richer flavour acquired from coconut milk and peanuts.\n\nLepet is made by steaming the \"ketan\" (sticky rice) until half cooked in coconut milk mixed with pandan leaf and salt, well until all of the coconut milk are absorbed into the sticky rice. Then the half-cooked coconut milk sticky rice is mixed further with grated coconut flesh and peanuts, then wrapped inside \"janur\" (young yellowish coconut leaf) in cylindrical-shape secured with strings made from coconut leaf fibers or any kind of strings. These rice packages inside this coconut leaf then steamed further until completely cooked. The most common filling is common peanuts, however other kinds of beans, such as kidney beans, cowpea, jack bean or corn might also be used.\n\nIn Sundanese area of West Java, it is known as \"leupeut\" usually made in smaller size with peanut fillings, and usually consumed with tahu sumedang fried tofu. It is a popular snack in Kuningan and Sumedang Regency.\n\nIn Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, there is similar-named food called lepat, although the recipe and method slightly different, as lepat uses palm sugar and grated coconut flesh fillings, and wrapped inside banana leaf instead of young coconut leaf.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43440003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43440003", "title": "Kushikatsu", "text": "Kushikatsu\n\n, also known as , is a Japanese dish of deep-fried skewered meat and vegetables. In Japanese, refers to the skewers used while \"katsu\" means a deep-fried cutlet of meat.\n\nKushikatsu can be made with chicken, pork, seafood, and seasonal vegetables. These are skewered on bamboo \"kushi\"; dipped in egg, flour, and panko; and deep-fried in vegetable oil. They may be served straight or with tonkatsu sauce.\n\n\nThe origin of kushiage is said to be served at food bars in downtown Osaka, in the Shinsekai neighborhood. Kushikatsu restaurants specialize in the dish. An owner of a small Shinsekai food bar since 1929 is said to be the pioneer cook, and her menu was quite popular among the district of blue collar workers. She prepared meat on skewers and deep fried, which was a kind of fast food handy to eat, not costly, and filling.\n\nAs that menu spread to other areas of Osaka and beyond, it is standard that kushikatsu are prepared with a single food not like that in Tokyo where, for example, they alternately put pork and onion on a skewer. Wider varieties of foods were prepared as the menu developed, on the contrary to those in Nagoya or Tokyo, for instance thin slices of pickled ginger or sausage by itself.\n\nGenerally speaking, the food on a skewer is smaller in Osaka style, and customers tend to order larger numbers of kushi compared to Tokyo or Nagoya. That encouraged many kushiage restaurants to use a premixed \"batter flour\" of powdered egg and flour (compared to that in Tokyo or Nagoya where batter is prepared with fresh egg, water and flour topped with panko crusts). High-end kushiage restaurants in Osaka serve kushikatu in Tokyo-Nagoya style. Grated yam is added for softer texture. New types of kushikatsu restaurants serve fondue-style kushikatsu where customers fry kushi at the table in a deep pan with cooking oil. Kushinobō is a typical high-end Osaka-style kushiage restaurant with franchises across Japan, and it is appreciated for its unique serving style — until a customer informs them that they are full and don't need any more, they continue to bring variations of kushiage to their table.\n\nDiced cabbage leaves are a free condiment prepared in a large bowl on the table, which is believed to prevent a feeling dull in the stomach.\n\nThe basic kushikatsu in Kanto eastern Japan area including Tokyo is cooked with pork rib sliced in 3–4 cm (1.5 in) dice, thrust on skewer with sliced onion or leek alternately. Battered with fresh egg, flour and thin layer of panko crust, the skewer is deep fried in vegetable oil — cottonseed, soybean, canola or rapeseed oil. At the table, skewers are seasoned with thick brown sauce, sweeter than Worcestershire sauce, with mustard if they have it in the cruet stand.\n\nIn Nagoya and its surrounding cities, they serve the local delicacy doteni, and have an option to order kushikatsu with that. Unlike the serving style in Osaka and Tokyo, in Nagoya, they dip kushikatu in the thick sauce they grilled and sauteed beef sinew. That sauce is based on hatcho-miso, and the kushikatsu is called miso katsu.\n\nSophisticated sauces are prepared in suburban areas of other cities including Nishinomiya and Kobe, and several sauces are served along with kushikatsu course. Plain salt, soy sauce, sesame oil and ketchup along with tartar sauce, miso, mayonnaise and other dip style sauce could be the speciality of each restaurant.\n\nEating style is unique at kushikatu restaurants and food bars as kushikatsu is dipped into a pot of thinner sauce before eating. As a sauce pot is shared among customers, reinserting food after a bite is seen as bad manners and unsanitary. Instead, a slice of cabbage is used to scoop up sauce from the pot and pour it onto the kushikatsu. In some restaurants they put a brush or spoon at the shared pot to season the kushi.\n\nSome kushiyaki restaurants have a menu and instructions in English and other languages to warn travelers not to dip food into the shared sauce pot after biting it.\n\nA comic kushikatsu song titled \"Kushikatsu wa ippon\" became popular to the generation born in 1990s as they enjoyed the song in children's song program on TV broadcast. \n\n"}
