{"id": "20646531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646531", "title": "Devi", "text": "Devi\n\nDevī (Sanskrit: देवी) is the Sanskrit word for \"goddess\"; the masculine form is Deva. Devi – the feminine form, and Deva – the masculine form, mean \"heavenly, divine, anything of excellence\", and are also gender specific terms for a deity in Hinduism.\n\nThe concept and reverence for goddesses appears in the Vedas, which were composed in the 2nd millennium BCE; however, they do not play a central role in that era. Goddesses such as Parvati and Durga have continued to be revered into the modern era. The medieval era Puranas witnessed a major expansion in mythology and literature associated with \"Devi\", with texts such as the Devi Mahatmya, wherein she manifests as the ultimate truth and supreme power. She has inspired the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism.\n\nThe divine feminine has the strongest presence as Devi in Hinduism, among major world religions, from the ancient times to the present. The goddess is viewed as central in Shakti and Saiva Hindu traditions.\n\n\"Devi\" and \"Deva\" are Sanskrit terms found in Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE. Deva is masculine, and the related feminine equivalent is devi. Monier-Williams translates it as \"heavenly, divine, terrestrial things of high excellence, exalted, shining ones\".\nEtymologically, the cognates of \"Devi\" are Latin \"dea\" and Greek \"thea\". When capitalized, \"Devi\" or \"Mata\" refers to goddess as divine mother in Hinduism. \"Deva\" is also referred to as \"Devatā\", and \"Devi\" as \"Devika\".\n\nAccording to Douglas Harper, the etymological root \"Dev-\" means \"a shining one,\" from *div- \"to shine,\" and it is a cognate with Greek dios \"divine\" and Zeus, and Latin deus (Old Latin deivos).\n\nThe \"Devīsūkta\" of the \"Rigveda\" 10.125.1 through 10.125.8, is among the most studied hymns declaring that the ultimate reality is a goddess:\n\nThe Vedas includes numerous goddesses including Parvati (power), Lakshmi (wealth), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the \"Rigveda\". However, the goddesses are not discussed as frequently as gods (Devas). Parvati, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts, particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Devi, the Supreme power.\n\nDevi is the supreme being in the Shakta tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smarta Tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of Brahman that is revered. In other Hindu traditions, Devi embodies the active energy and power of Deva, and they always appear together complementing each other, such as Parvati with Shiva in Shaivism, Saraswati with Brahma in Brahmanism, and Lakshmi with Vishnu in Vaishnavism.\n\nThe Devi-inspired philosophy is propounded in many Hindu texts, such as the Devi Upanishad, which states that Shakti is essentially Brahman (ultimate metaphysical Reality), from her arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness), she is bliss and non-bliss, the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and all of the universe. Shakthi is Parvati, Shiva’s wife. She is also mentioned as the creative power of Shiva in Tripura Upanishad, Bahvricha Upanishad, and Guhyakali Upanishad.\n\nDevi identifies herself in the \"Devi Upanishad\" as brahman in her reply to the gods stating that she rules the world, blesses devotees with riches, she is the supreme deity to whom all worship is to be offered, and that she infuses Ātman in every soul. Devi asserts that she is creator of earth and heaven and resides there. Her creation of sky as father, seas as mother is reflected as the \"Inner Supreme Self\". Her creations are not prompted by any Higher being and she resides in all her creations. She is, states Devi, the eternal and infinite consciousness engulfing earth and heaven, and \"all forms of bliss and non-bliss, knowledge and ignorance, Brahman and Non-Brahman\". The tantric aspect in \"Devi Upanishad\", states June McDaniel is the usage of the terms yantra, bindu, bija, mantra, shakti and chakra.\n\nAmong the major world religions, the concept of goddess in Hinduism as the divine feminine, has had the strongest presence since the ancient times.\n\nParvati is the Hindu goddess of love, beauty, purity, fertility and devotion. She is considered to be one of the greatest forms of Adi Parashakti. She is the gentle and nurturing aspect of Adi Parashakti. She is the mother goddess in Hinduism and has many attributes and aspects. Each of her aspects is expressed with a different name, giving her over 100 names in regional Hindu mythologies of India, including the popular name \"Gauri\". Along with Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and learning), she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses.\n\nParvati is the wife of Shiva - the destroyer, recycler and regenerator of universe and all life. She is the mother of Hindu gods Ganesha and Kartikeya.\n\nRita Gross states, that the view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is incomplete symbolism of the power of the feminine in mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, are involved with the broad range of culturally valued goals and activities. Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature. She is balanced by Durga, who is strong and capable without compromising her femaleness. She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati's numerous aspects, states Gross, reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition.\n\nIn Hindu belief, Parvati is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release. A common symbolism for her and her husband Siva is in the form of yoni and linga respectively. In ancient literature, yoni means womb and place of gestation, the yoni-linga metaphor represents \"origin, source or regenerative power\". The linga-yoni icon is widespread, found in Shaivite Hindu temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Often called \"Shivalinga\", it almost always has both linga and the yoni.\n\nDevi is portrayed as the ideal wife, mother and householder in Indian legends. In Indian art, this vision of ideal couple is derived from Shiva and Parvati as being half of the other, represented as \"Ardhanarisvara\". Parvati is found extensively in ancient Indian literature, and her statues and iconography grace ancient and medieval era Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nLakshmi, also called Sri, is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune, and prosperity (both material and spiritual). She is the consort and active energy of Vishnu. Her four hands represent the four goals of human life considered important to the Hindu way of life – dharma, kāma, artha, and moksha. She is also part of Tridevi which consists of Lakshmi, Parvati (goddess of power, fertility, love, beauty), and Saraswati (goddess of music, wisdom, and learning).\n\nIn the ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi. The marriage and relationship between Lakshmi and Vishnu as wife and husband, states Patricia Monaghan, is \"the paradigm for rituals and ceremonies for the bride and groom in Hindu weddings.\"\n\nArchaeological discoveries and ancient coins suggest the recognition and reverence for goddess Lakshmi in the Scytho-Parthian kingdom and throughout India by the 1st millennium BCE. She is also revered in other non-Hindu cultures of Asia, such as in Tibet. Lakshmi's iconography and statues have also been found in Hindu temples throughout southeast Asia, estimated to be from second half of 1st millennium CE. In modern times, Lakshmi is worshipped as the goddess of wealth. The festivals of Diwali and Sharad Purnima (Kojagiri Purnima) are celebrated in her honor.\n\nSaraswati, is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning. She is the consort of Brahma.\n\nThe earliest known mention of Saraswati as a goddess is in Rigveda. She has remained significant as a goddess from the Vedic age through modern times of Hindu traditions. Some Hindus celebrate the festival of Vasant Panchami (the fifth day of spring) in her honour, and mark the day by helping young children learn how to write alphabets on that day. She is also part of Tridevi which consists of Saraswati, Parvati (goddess of power, fertility, love, beauty), and Lakshmi (goddess of material wealth, prosperity, and fortune).\n\nSaraswati is often depicted dressed in pure white, often seated on a white lotus. She not only embodies knowledge but also the experience of the highest reality. Her iconography is typically in white themes from dress to flowers to swan – the colour symbolizing Sattwa Guna or purity, discrimination for true knowledge, insight and wisdom.\n\nShe is generally shown to have four arms, but sometimes just two. The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning — a \"pustaka\" (book or script), a \"mala\" (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (lute or vina). The book she holds symbolizes the Vedas representing the universal, divine, eternal, and true knowledge as well as all forms of learning. A mālā of crystals, representing the power of meditation, a pot of water represents powers to purify the right from wrong. The musical instrument, typically a veena, represents all creative arts and sciences, and her holding it symbolizes expressing knowledge that creates harmony. The Saraswatirahasya Upanishad of the Yajurveda contain ten verses called \"\"dasa sloki\"\" which are in praise of Sarasvati. In this Upanishad, she is extolled as You are the swan gliding over the pond of creative energy, waves and waves of creative forces emanating from your form! Radiant Goddess resplendant in white, dwell forver in the Kashmir of my heart.\n\nSaraswati is also found outside India, such as in Japan, Vietnam, Bali (Indonesia) and Myanmar.\n\nVedic literature does not have any particular goddess matching the concept of Durga. Her legends appear in the medieval era, as angry, ferocious aspects of mother goddess Parvati take the avatar as Durga or Kali. She manifests as a goddess with eight or ten arms holding weapons and skulls of demons, and is astride on a tiger or lion. In Skanda Purana, Parvati assumes the form of a warrior-goddess and defeats a demon called Durg who assumes the form of a buffalo. In this aspect, she is known by the name Durga. In later Hindu literature, states Jansen, she is attributed the role of the \"energy, power (shakti) of the Impersonal Absolute\".\n\nIn the Shaktism traditions of Hinduism, found particularly in eastern states of India, Durga is a popular goddess. In medieval era composed texts such as the Puranas, she emerges as a prominent goddess in the context of crisis, when evil asuras were on the ascent. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue the forces of evil, led by Mahishasura. The warrior goddess, Durga as the unified form of all gods appears, she kills the Mahishasura, she is thereafter invincible and revered as \"preserver of Dharma, destroyer of evil\".\n\nDurga's emergence and mythology is described in the Puranas, particularly the \"Devi Mahatmya\". The text describes Kālī's emerging out of Durga when she becomes extremely angry. Durga's face turns pitch dark, and suddenly Kali springs forth from Durga's forehead. She is black, wears a garland of human heads, is clothed in a tiger skin, rides a tiger, and wields a staff topped by a human skull. She destroys the asuras. Literature on goddess Kali recounts several such appearances, mostly in her terrifying but protective aspects. Kali appears as an independent deity, or like Durga, viewed as the wife of Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time. Kali, also called Kalaratri, is called in Yoga Vasistha as Prakṛti or \"all of nature\". She is described in the text, state Shimkhanda and Herman, as the \"one great body of cosmos\", and same as Devis \"Durga, Jaya and Siddha, Virya, Gayatri, Saraswati, Uma, Savitri\". She is the power that supports the earth, with all its seas, islands, forests, deserts and mountains, asserts \"Yoga Vasistha\". She is not to be confused with the Kali yuga, which is spelled similarly yet holds a different meaning. The Kali yuga is presented as a threat to Mother India,with pictures from the nineteenth century depicting the age as a \"ferocious meat-eating demon\" in comparison to India's depiction of \"a cow giving milk to her children\".\n\nThe largest annual festival associated with the goddess is Durga Puja celebrated in the month of Ashvin (September–October), where nine manifestations of Parvati (\"Navadurga\") are worshipped, each on a day over nine days. These are: Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta,Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri and Siddhidaatri.\n\nIn the feminist Shaktidharma denomination of Hinduism, the supreme deity Mahadevi manifests as the goddess Mahasaraswati in order to create, as the goddess Mahalaxmi in order to preserve, and as the goddess Mahakali (Parvati) in order to destroy. These three forms of the supreme goddess Mahadevi are collectively called the \"Tridevi\".\n\nSita, an incarnation of Lakshmi, is the wife of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. She is shakti or prakriti of Rama as told in the \"Ram Raksha Stotram\". In \"Sita Upanishad\", a shakta Upanishad, Sita is extolled as the supreme goddess. The Upanishad identifies Sita with Prakrti (nature) which is constituted by \"will\" ichha, activity (kriya) and knowledge (jnana). The Upanishad also states that Sita emerged while furrowing, at the edge of the plough. She is extolled as one of the Panchakanya for her virtuous qualities; taking their names destroys all sins.\n\nHer life story and journeys with her husband Rama and brother-in-law Lakshmana are part of the Hindu epic Ramayana, an allegorical story with Hindu spiritual and ethical teachings. However, there are many versions of Ramayana, and her story as a goddess in Hindu mythology. Her legends also vary in southeast Asian versions of the epic Ramayana, such as in the Ramakien of Thailand where she is spelled as \"Sida\" (or \"Nang Sida\").\n\nIn Valmiki Ramayana, Sita is repeatedly expressed as manifestation of Lakshmi, as the one who blesses abundance in agriculture, food, and wealth. She is referred to golden goddess, wherein after Rama (Vishnu) is bereaved of her, he refuses to marry again, insists that he is married solely and forever to her, and uses a golden image of Sita as a substitute in the performance of his duties as a king. Sita, in many Hindu mythology, is the \"Devi\" associated with agriculture, fertility, food and wealth for continuation of humanity.\n\nRadha means \"prosperity, success and lightning.\" She is the female counterpart of Krishna. In Puranic literature such as the \"Brahma Vaivarta Purana\", she is known as the Goddess of love. She is known as goddess from the 12th century onwards and has figured prominently in the poems of Vidyapati (1352–1448) as a cosmic queen. She is also considered as an incarnation of Lakshmi. According to legend, Radha was married but she had mystical intimacy with Krishna.\n\nRadha was made famous through Jayadeva's \"Gitagovinda\" poems. She was born as a milkmaid. She is considered a goddess of the heaven (Goloka) who was considered a combination of Shakti and Vishnu's power. Her love affair with Krishna was set in Vraja and its surrounding forests much before Krishna married Rukmini and Satyabhama. Her attribute is lotus and she has always been a part of the bhakti movement symbolising \"yearning of human soul drawn to Krishna\". In South India she is considered as Bhumidevi and is linked to Saraswati. The \"Gitagovinda\" (12th century), a lyrical drama, a \"mystical erotic poem\", describes the love of Krishna and gopis, Radha in particular, a symbolism for the human soul.\n\nIn the sixth century when Devi Mahatmya came into practice the name Devi (goddess) or Mahadevi (Great Goddess) came into prominence to represent one female goddess to encompass the discrete goddesses like Parvati and so forth. In the Hindu mythology, Devi and Deva are usually paired, complement and go together, typically shown as equal but sometimes the Devi is shown smaller or in subordinate role. Some goddesses, however, play an independent role in Hindu pantheon, and are revered as Supreme without any male god(s) present or with males in subordinate position. Mahadevi, as mother goddess, is an example of the later, where she subsumes all goddesses, becomes the ultimate goddess, and is sometimes just called Devi. The counterpart of Mahadevi is Mahadeva who is Shiva so many people think of Mahadevi as Parvati.\nTheological texts projected Mahadevi as ultimate reality in the universe as a \"powerful, creative, active, transcendent female being.\" The Puranas and Tantra literature of India celebrates this idea, particularly between the 12th–16th century, and the best example of such texts being the various manuscript versions of Devi Bhagavata Purana with the embedded Devi Gita therein.\n\nDevi Bhagavata Purana gives prime position to Mahadevi as the mother of all encompassing the three worlds and gives her the position of being all of universe – the material and the spiritual. In the Upanishadic text Devi Upanishad, a Sakta Upanishad and an important Tantric text probably composed sometime between the ninth and fourtheenth centuries the Goddess is addressed in the most general and universal of terms, as Mahadevi, and represents all goddesses as different manifestations of her. The Lalita Sahasranama (Thousand names of Lalita (Parvati)or states that Mahadevi is known by different synonyms such as \"Jagatikanda\" (anchors the world), \"Vishvadhika\" (one who surpasses the universe), \"Nirupama\" (one who has no match), \"Parameshwari\" (dominant governor), \"Vyapini\" (encompasses everything), \"Aprameya\" (immeasurable), \"Anekakotibrahmadajanani\" (creator of many universes), \"Vishvagarbha\" (she whose garbha or womb subsumes the universe), \"Sarvadhara\" (helps all), \"Sarvaga\" (being everywhere at the same time, \"Sarvalokesi\" (governs all worlds) and \"Vishavdaharini\" one who functions for the whole universe).\n\nThe Mahadevi goddess has many aspects to her personality. She focuses on that side of her that suits her objectives, but unlike male Hindu deities, her powers and knowledge work in concert in a multifunctional manner. The ten aspects of her, also called Mahavidyas (or great forms of her knowledge) are forms of Parvati and they are: Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhairavi, Bhuvanesvari, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala.\n\nTantric literature such as Soundarya Lahari meaning \"Flood of Beauty\", credited to Adi Shankaracharya a shakta or tantric poem, is dedicated to the Supreme Deity of the sect, the Devi who is considered much superior to Shiva. It celebrates Parvati and her feminine persona. It is an approach to the tantra through Parvati.\n\nIn Shakti Tantra traditions, Devis are visualized with yantra and are a tool for spiritual journey for the tantric adept. The adepts ritually construct triangle yantras with proper use of visualization, movement and mantra. The adepts believe, state John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff, that \"to establish such yantra is to place the macrocosm within oneself\", and doing so can yield temporal benefits, spiritual powers or enlightenment.\n\nA tantric text titled \"Vigyan Bhairav Tantra\", 'Vigyan' meaning \"consciousness\" is a conversation between Shiva and Parvati rendered in 112 verses, elaborates on \"wisdom and insight of pure consciousness.\"\n\nDevi Puja is the worship of Parvati which is observed through four forms of Devi Yantra; the first is Tara that exists in the realm of the fourth chakra representing the spiritual heart; Saraswati emanates in the first chakra; Lakshmi forms the second chakra; and Parvati is at the heart of the third chakra and completes the chakra. Worship through this Yantra leads to realization of \"cosmic energy\" within oneself.\n\nMatrikas, that is, the mothers, are seven or eight female divinities, which are depicted as a group. They are all forms of Parvati. They are Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheshwari, Indrani, Kaumari, Varahi and Chamundi or Narasimhi. The Matrikas concept are important in Tantric traditions. They are described in the Isaanasivagurudevapaddhati, as creations to facilitate Lord Shiva face his adversary Andhakasura. All the Matrikas are depicted in a sitting position known as the Lalitasana and bedecked with heavy jewellery.\n\nScholars state that the concept of Matrikas as powerful goddesses emerged in the early 1st millennium AD, and possibly much earlier.\n\nThe idea of eight mother goddesses together is found in Himalayan Shaivism, while seven divine mothers (Sapta Matrika) is more common in South India.\n\n"}

In the UK, it is usually employed as an ethnic or racial slur, and considered derogatory and offensive. In Australia, it tends to be applied to a wider range of peoples, and although it may be used as a slur, to some extent has been reclaimed and is used as a self-descriptor by them.\n\nThe origin of the term is unclear. It was first noted by lexicographer F.C. Bowen in 1929, in his \"Sea Slang: a dictionary of the old-timers’ expressions and epithets\", where he defines wogs as \"lower class Babu shipping clerks on the Indian coast.\" Many dictionaries say \"wog\" derives from the golliwogg, a blackface minstrel doll character from a children's book, \"The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg\" by Florence Kate Upton, published in 1895; or from \"pollywog\", a dialect term for tadpole that is used in maritime circles to indicate someone who has not crossed the equator.\n\nSuggestions that the word is an acronym for \"wily Oriental gentleman\", \"working on government service\", or similar, are examples of false etymology.\n\n\"Wog\", in the UK, is a derogatory and racially offensive slang word referring to a non-white, Jewish, or darker-skinned white person, including people from the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, other parts of Asia such as the East Indies, or the Mediterranean area, including Southern Europeans. A similar term, \"wop\", has historically been used to refer to Italians.\n\nThe saying, \"The wogs begin at Calais\" (implying that everyone who is not British is a wog), appears to date from the First World War but was popularised by George Wigg, Labour MP for Dudley, in 1949 when in a parliamentary debate concerning the Burmese, Wigg shouted at the Conservative benches, \"The Honourable Gentleman and his friends think they are all 'wogs'. Indeed, the Right Honourable Member for Woodford [i.e., Winston Churchill] thinks that the 'wogs' begin at Calais.\"\n\nAs reported by English-Jewish journalist Linda Grant, people in England have referred to Jews and Israelis as \"wogs\", as well.\n\nIn Season 1 Episode 6 - 'The Germans' episode of Fawlty Towers (a 1975 British TV show), Major Gowen specifically refers to \"wog\" as meaning any person from India (when speaking about the India vs England cricket game at the Oval to Basil Fawlty).\n\nIn Australia, the term \"wog\" refers to residents of Southern European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Eastern European ethnicity or appearance. The slur became widely diffused with an increase in immigration from Europe and the Levant after the Second World War and the term expanded to include immigrants from the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. These new arrivals were perceived by the majority population as contrasting with the larger predominant Anglo Protestant/Anglo-Australian/Anglo-Celtic Australian culture.\n\nToday, \"wog\" is used particularly in places in Australia with substantial Southern European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern populations; mainly Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. As with other slang and\" prima facie\" profanity used in contemporary Australian English, the term \"wog\" may be employed either aggressively or affectionately within differing contexts.\n\nIn Australian English, \"wog\" can also be used as a slang word for an illness such as a common cold or influenza, as in: \"I'm coming down with a wog\". Such usage is not perceived as derogatory.\n\nMore recently, Southern European-Australian performing artists have taken ownership of the term \"wog\", defusing its original pejorative nature. The popular 1980s stage show \"Wogs Out of Work\", created by Nick Giannopoulos and Simon Palomares, is an early example. The production was followed on television with \"Acropolis Now\", starring Giannopoulos, Palomares, George Kapiniaris, and Mary Coustas, and films such as \"The Wog Boy\" and \"\", and parodies such as those of Santo Cilauro (Italian), Eric Bana (Croatian-German), Vince Colosimo (Italian), Nick Giannopoulos (Greek), Frank Lotito (Italian), Mary Coustas (Greek), and SBS Television's offbeat \"Pizza\" and later Here Come the Habibs. TV series have continued this change in Australian cultural history—with some even classifying a genre of \"wogsploitation\" of pop culture products being created by and for a proudly \"wog\" market. Recent works of the genre have been used by Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds to assert ethnic identity rather than succumb to ethnic stereotypes. Upon the release of \"Wog Boy 2\", Giannopoulos discussed the contemporary use of the term \"wog\" in the Australian context:\n\nI think by defusing the word 'wog' we've shown our maturity and our great ability to adapt and just laugh things off, you know... When I first came [to Greece] and I started trying to explain to them why we got called 'wog' they'd get really angry about it, you know. They were, \"Why? Why they say this about the Greek people?\" You know? But then when they see what we've done with it—and this is the twist—that we've turned it into a term of endearment, they actually really get into that...\n\nThus, in contemporary Australia, the term \"wog\" may, in certain contexts, be viewed as a \"nickname\" rather than a pejorative term—akin to the nicknames ascribed within Australian English to other historically significant cultural groupings such as the English (\"Poms\"), the Americans (\"Yanks\") and New Zealanders (\"Kiwis\").\n\nIn Canadian military slang used by combat arms units (that is, front line fighting forces), \"wog\" is a derogatory term for any rear echelon personnel and those who are not members of the combat arms. \n\nDuane Clarridge, a former CIA officer, explained that the term \"wog factor\" was used by the CIA \"to acknowledge that the motivations that shape decision-making in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent are very different from our own.\"\n\nThe word \"wog\" is used by Scientologists to refer to non-Scientologists. Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard defined wog as a \"common, everyday garden-variety humanoid ... He 'is' a body. [He] doesn't know he's there, etc. He isn't there as a spirit at all. He is not operating as a thetan.\"\n\n\n"}

Generally it consists of peppermint candy pieces, such as candy canes, in white chocolate on top of dark chocolate, but peppermint bark can refer to any chocolate with peppermint candy pieces in it.\n\nIt is especially popular around the Christmas season. Companies known for selling it seasonally include Williams-Sonoma, Ghirardelli, and Dove. Though they do not label it as peppermint bark, Hershey's also sells peppermint Hershey's kisses.\n\nIn the United States, peppermint bark is also sold by some Girl Scout troops as part of an expanded range of items other than cookies. Jelly Belly also sells a combination of its dark chocolate and candy cane jelly beans as a \"Peppermint Bark Recipe Mix\".\n\nThe recipe for peppermint bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined on a baking sheet and then chilled until firm. The bark is then removed from the sheet and broken into pieces in a similar way to peanut brittle.\n\nVariations on peppermint bark can include a two-toned layered type, where a bottom layer of dark chocolate is covered with the white chocolate and crushed mint layer on top.

Made from ground hazelnuts, they are not to be confused with the \"Berner Honiglebkuchen\", another Bernese specialty.\n\nThe \"Berner Haselnusslebkuchen\" are made of a marzipan-like mass of roasted and ground hazelnuts and about one eighth ground almonds, as well as a little sugar, honey, cinnamon, candied lemon and orange peel, held together by egg white. The addition of water or flour is not necessary, as the oil in the hazelnuts helps the mass stick together. The grinding of the hazelnuts requires extensive experience: if ground too hard, the hazelnut oils will liquefy and evaporate during baking, making the \"Lebkuchen\" hard like a \"zwieback\".\n\nThe hazelnut mass is rolled out into a spread of dough thick. The baker may then cut out DIN A5-sized rectangular pieces and press them into a form traditionally depicting a bear, Berne's heraldic animal (\"pictured above\"). She may also use cookie cutters in the shape of a bear or Santa Claus, or she may cut the dough into small rectangular pieces called \"Leckerli\". The \"Lebkuchen\" are then allowed to dry for a few hours, during which the crystallizing sugar forms a faint crust on the dough's surface. Afterwards, they are baked at for 10 to 15 minutes. A well-made \"Haselnusslebkuchen\" should be crunchy on the outside, but remain soft and moist within. The \"Lebkuchen\" may then be decorated further with icing, hazelnuts or almonds.\n\nA sweet similar to the \"Haselnusslebkuchen\", although still containing some flour, is first described in the 1835 \"Neues Berner Kochbuch\", a cookbook by Lina Rytz. During the 19th and early 20th century, Bernese cookbooks record numerous recipes for \"Haselnussleckerli\" or \"Bernerläckerli\", indicating that the sweet was initially only produced in the small \"Leckerli\" form, with the larger rectangular forms coming into use only in the second half of the 20th century. The now-common name of \"Haselnusslebkuchen\" is first used in a 1946 baker's manual.\n\nThe \"Lebkuchen\"'s expensive ingredients such as hazelnuts and sugar indicate that it was always a gift article and a holiday sweet; up until the later 19th century, sugar was largely unaffordable for the Bernese working class. \"Haselnusslebkuchen\" continue to be made by bakers in the entire canton of Berne during December.

Distinguished from other Lebkuchen by their sometimes elaborate sugar decorations, they are not to be confused with the \"Berner Haselnusslebkuchen\", another Bernese specialty which is made from ground hazelnuts.\n\n\"Honiglebkuchen\" dough is made of honey, milk, margarine, flour and potassium carbonate (as leavening agent), as well as a mixture of spices. The spice mixture is specific to each bakery – which is why it is said that no two \"Honiglebkuchen\" taste the same – but coriander, anise, star anise, cloves, ginger and nutmeg are commonly used.\n\nAfter a leavening period of four days, the dough is softened by rolling it, rolled out to a thickness of , and cut into the desired shape. Most \"Honiglebkuchen\" are rectangular, but round or heart-shaped forms are also used. The \"Lebkuchen\" are baked as dryly as possible at around for about 14 to 20 minutes. Immediately afterwards, they are given a shiny coat with a solution of potato starch in water, called \"Feculé\".\n\nThe sugar decorations are traditionally applied manually by specialised confectioners using a triangular bag. The most popular motif is the bear, Berne's heraldic animal, which is shown in various scenes and poses, such as in the \"Bärengraben\". Cheaper \"Lebkuchen\", such as the one pictured above, feature standardised decorations applied by template.\n\n\"Lebkuchen\" with honey and exotic spices were already made in medieval Swiss monasteries. A 16th-century recipe from Lucerne is already very similar to the contemporary recipe, except that fewer spices were used. In Berne, the \"Lebkuchen\" is first recorded in early 19th century cookbooks. The sugar decorations are believed to have come into general use some time after sugar manufactured from mangelwurzel became widely affordable in the early 19th century, but around the turn of the 20th century at the latest. A baker's manual of 1946 records that \"the embellishments ... are made according to a decades-old tradition\" and that \"the application of bears, edelweiss, doves and so forth ... is and has always been a specialty and a point of pride of the Bernese confectioner.\"\n\nTogether with their hazelnut counterpart, \"Honiglebkuchen\" are the signature product of Bernese bakers and are particularly popular in the December holiday season, as well as with tourists throughout the year. Recently, \"Honiglebkuchen\" whose decoration can be customised through Internet services have also become popular.\n\nBakers recommend taking the \"Lebkuchen\" together with café au lait, in which the cake can also be dunked to improve its flavour. If eaten in this manner, even \"Lebkuchen\" hardened by months of exposure to air remain appetizing.\n\n\n"}

Spanish \"cocido\" is a cognate.\n\nCocido is made of various meats (pork, beef, chicken, mutton), embutidos and vegetables like cabbage, turnips, parsnips, potatoes, carrots and chickpeas (\"garbanzos.\") Other foods (such as eggs or cheese) can be added before serving. Due to the wide regional diversity of the dish, the word \"cocido\" is typically followed by the place of origin (e.g. \"madrileño\", \"maragato\", \"lebaniego\", \"gallego\").\n\nThe basic method of preparation involves slow cooking over a low heat. \"Cozido\" may be prepared with a wide variety of vegetables, meats, fish, and seafood. Ingredients vary across regions.\n\nCocido makes for a complete meal as it contains all the necessary components of a nutritious diet. In the past, it was a popular dish among laborers whose jobs involved significant physical exertion. It was eaten primarily during the winter, helping people who lived in homes with inadequate heating maintain their body heat. So, the vegetables used in cocido are typically winter vegetables like turnips, carrots, and cabbage. However, as vegetables are now available year-round, other vegetables may be substituted.\n\nOne commonality among all the regional variants is that the cocido is served in multiple courses in the same meal. The first course is usually a soup, followed by a second course of the beans and potatoes used in the soup, with the meat and vegetables from the soup as the third course. Each course is known as a \"vuelco\" (overturn) because the pot is turned over every time to empty out the ingredients. Recently, it has become popular in some areas to end with a plate of \"huevos estrellados\".\n\nSome ancient recipes (generally from convents) call for cocidos of up to fourteen courses, using an elaborate selection of ingredients.\n\nAlthough the \"cocido madrileño\" is most famous, many other types exist, such as \"cocido lebaniego\" and \"cocido montañés\".\n\nDuring the 19th century, cocido was a common dish for servants in the homes of the wealthy. Often, too much would be made, and the excess would be given to the poor. Alternatively, the leftovers were tossed with eggs to be served for dinner or the next day, giving rise to the dish \"ropa vieja\" as well as \"arroz al horno\" and \"arroz con costra\" in Valencian cuisine.\n\nIn Portugal, \"cozido à portuguesa\" is prepared with several vegetables (beans, potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbages, rice), meat (chicken, pork ribs, bacon, pork ear and trotters, various parts of beef), smoked sausages (chouriço, farinheira, morcela, blood sausage), and other ingredients. Numerous regional variations exist throughout Portugal, and the dish is considered part of the Portuguese heritage.\n\nIt is a rich stew that usually includes beef shin, pork, assorted offal, Portuguese smoked sausages (morcela, farinheira and chouriço) and in some regions chicken, served with cabbage, carrots, turnips, rice, potatoes, and collard greens. It is often served with olive oil and red wine.\n\n\"Cozido de grão\" is prepared with chickpeas as the main ingredient.\n\nIn São Miguel Island, Açores, meaty \"cozido\" known as \"cozido das Furnas\" is cooked underground for four to five hours, with the natural heat from the volcanic activities.\n\nIn Brazil, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, and cassava are commonly used. Bananas can also be included in Brazilian \"cozido\" dishes.\n"}

{"id": "20700743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20700743", "title": "Hook (bowling)", "text": "Hook (bowling)\n\nA hook in ten-pin bowling is a ball that rolls in a curving pattern (versus straight). The purpose of the hook is to give the ball a better angle at the 1-3 pocket (right-handers) or 1-2 pocket (left-handers.) When a ball is rolled straight, hitting the pocket must be precise. By hooking the ball, the ball will hit the pins with more force, producing better carry - especially on the 5-pin during a strike ball. Straight roll - even when it hits the pocket, will tend to leave a tap, such as the 5-pin on a light hit, or the 10-pin if the ball was just slightly right of the head pin. A hook ball can create strikes with less precise hits at the pocket.\n\nA hook ball can also help the bowler shape the shot on challenging oil patterns.\n\nIn other games of bowling, such as duckpin bowling or candlepin bowling, a hook is virtually non-existent for experienced bowlers since the ball is much smaller than in ten-pin bowling, and rolls too fast to the pins to allow a hook to develop.\n\nThere are two ways to produce a hook. The first method involves bowling technique. At the moment of throwing the bowling ball, the hand should be behind the ball and where the thumb (for a right-hander) is anywhere between 10-o'clock and 12-o'clock, and the two fingers are between 4-o'clock and 6-o'clock. Just before releasing the ball, the entire hand starts rotating in a counter-clockwise motion. The thumb must fall out of the ball first. And then, the middle and ring finger release almost simultaneously, again in a counter-clockwise direction. The two fingers releasing while rotating is called \"lift,\" where this type of a release gives the roll more torque and therefore more power. This release technique gives the bowling ball its spin needed for the hook. When the two fingers lift the ball correctly, it will cause the thumb to naturally fall out of the ball first, so one does not have to make a conscious effort to remove the thumb before the fingers.\n\nOf course there are innumerable variations in style and technique and the position of the thumb can vary from person to person. Some bowlers, including professionals, will actually roll the bowling ball with just the two fingers, allowing the hand to give the ball even more torque without having to worry about the thumb restricting the spin.\n\nThe second way to produce a hook is by modifying the bowling ball. Illegally, one can play with the \"weighting\" of the bowling ball, such as drilling the ball so that there is more side weight on the right side of the ball (for a right-hander,) which would cause the ball to pull from right to left, causing a hook. Bowling balls ship with the weighting specifications on the container. A bowling shop professional can drill a bowling ball by first knowing the type of roll the bowler wants, and then can pick out the bowling ball with the weighting specifications in mind that match the bowler's needs. For a beginning bowler, the professional will usually drill the ball with the label directly in the middle, and between the fingers and thumb holes, causing the weighting to be balanced on both sides, causing the ball to roll straight.\n\nUnder USBC regulations, one can drill up to five holes on the bowling ball. Since most bowlers use three holes (thumb and two fingers,) one could drill additional holes on other parts of the bowling ball, to take additional weight off of a portion of the bowling ball, such as an \"axis hole\" that allows the bowling ball's hook to stabilize during its roll to the pins. Doctoring the bowling ball by adding additional holes is not recommended unless the bowler is experienced enough to know where to place these holes, such as studying the track area of the ball and knowing where to place the axis hole.\n\nA \"backup ball\" produces the opposite result of a hook. When a ball is rolled by a right-hander, the ball will hook from left to right. The bowling ball can be drilled for a left-handed bowler. The exact same principles of hooking a ball are applied on a backup ball, except the hand rotates clockwise.\n\n\n"}

As DNA is printed on a glass slide for the transfection process (the deliberate introduction of nucleic acids into cells) to occur before the addition of adherent cells, the order of addition of DNA and adherent cells is reverse that of conventional transfection. Hence, the word “reverse” is used.\n\nA DNA-gelatin mixture may be used for printing onto a slide. Gelatin powder is first dissolved in sterile Milli-Q water to form a 0.2% gelatin solution. Purified DNA plasmid is then mixed with the gelatin solution, and the final gelatin concentration is kept greater than 0.17%. Besides gelatin, atelocollagen and fibronetin are also successful transfection vectors for introducing foreign DNA into the cell nucleus.\n\nAfter the DNA-gelatin mixture preparation, the mixture is pipetted onto a slide surface and the slide is placed in a covered petri dish. A desiccant is added to the dish to dry up the solution. Finally, cultured cells are poured into the dish for plasmid uptake. However, with the invention of different types of microarray printing systems, hundreds of transfection mixes (containing different DNA of interest) may be printed on the same slide for cell uptake of plasmids. There are two major types of microarray printing systems manufactured by different companies: contact and non-contact printing systems. \n\nAn example of a non-contact printing system is the Piezorray Flexible Non-contact Microarraying System. It uses pressure control and a piezoelectric collar to squeeze out consistent drops of approximately 333 pL in volume. The PiezoTip dispensers do not contact the surface to which the sample is dispensed; thus, contamination potential is reduced and the risk of disrupting the target surface is eliminated. An example of a contact printing system is the SpotArray 72 (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) contact-spotting system. Its printhead can accommodate up to 48 pins, and creates compact arrays by selectively raising and lowering subsets of pins during printing. After printing, the pins are washed with a powerful pressure-jet pin washer and vacuum-dried, eliminating carryover. Another example of a contact printing system is the Qarray system (Genetix). It has three types of printing systems: QArray Mini, QArray 2 and QArray Max. After printing, the solution is allowed to dry up and the DNA-gelatin is stuck tightly in position on the array.\n\nFirst, adhesive from the HybriWell is peeled off and the HybriWell is attached over the area of the slide printed with the gelatin-DNA solution. Second, 200ul of transfection mix is pipetted into one of the HybriWell ports; the mixture will distribute evenly over the array. The array is then incubated, with temperature and time dependent on the cell types used. Third, the transfection mix is pipetted away and the HybriWell removed with a thin-tipped forceps. Fourth, the printed slide treated with transfection reagent is placed into a square dish with the printed side facing up. Fifth, the harvested cells are gently poured onto the slides (not on the printed areas). Finally, the dish is placed in a 37°C, 5% CO humidified incubator and incubated overnight.\n\nEffectene Reagent is used in conjunction with the enhancer and the DNA condensation buffer (Buffer EC) to achieve high transfection efficiency. In the first step of Effectene–DNA complex formation, the DNA is condensed by interaction with the enhancer in a defined-buffer system. Effectene Reagent is then added to the condensed DNA to produce condensed Effectene–DNA complexes. The Effectene–DNA complexes are mixed with the medium and directly added to the cells.\nEffectene Reagent spontaneously forms micelle structures exhibiting no size or batch variation (as may be found with pre-formulated liposome reagents). This feature ensures reproducibility of transfection-complex formation. The process of highly condensing DNA molecules and then coating them with Effectene Reagent is an effective way to transfer DNA into eukaryotic cells.\n\nThe advantages of reverse transfection (over conventional transfection) are: \n\nThe disadvantages of reverse transfection are: \n"}

It was first observed by Sergey Blazhko in 1907 in the star RW Draconis.\n\nThe physics behind the Blazhko effect is currently still a matter of debate, with there being three primary hypotheses.\nIn the first, referred to as the resonance model, the cause of the modulation is a non-linear resonance among either the fundamental or the first overtone pulsation mode of the star and a higher mode. The second, known as the magnetic model, assumes the variation to be caused by the magnetic field being inclined to the rotational axis, deforming the main radial mode. The magnetic model was ruled out in 2004 by high resolution spectro-polarimetric observations. The third model assumes that cycles in the convection cause the alternations and the modulations.\n\nObservational evidence based on Kepler observations indicates much of the Blazhko effect's two-cycle light curve modulation is due to simple period-doubling. Many RR Lyrae stars have a variability period of approximately 12 hours and ground-based astronomers typically make nightly observations about 24 hours apart; thus period-doubling results in brightness maximums during nightly observations that are significantly different than the daytime maximum.\n\n"}

The basis for this practice is Leviticus 7:23, \"You shall not eat of any fatty suet, whether from cattle, sheep, or goats.\"\n\nIt is much easier to perform \"nikkur\" on the front part of the animal. It is also easier to perform on non-domestic animals such as deer as the chelev does not need to be removed from such animals.\n\nSince it is difficult to perform \"nikkur\" on the hind part of domestic animals, the entire hind part is usually sold to the non-Jewish market in Ashkenazi Jewish communities. However, among Yemenite Jews, \"nikkur\" on the hind part of the animal is still practised. This tradition goes back for centuries. While many Muslims today (e.g. in the Middle East) do accept food from people of the book based on the Quranic precept, not all Muslim communities accept Kosher-slaughtered meat, including those hindquarters, as halal; communities that do not accept it include many on the Indian subcontinent. On the other hand, in countries like Israel, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher.\n\nThe following document (click to open), translated here from the original Hebrew, has been the basis for ritual slaughterers in Yemen when excising the fatty tissue (suet) known as \"chelev\" from the butchered animal, in accordance with a biblical injunction in Leviticus 3:3–4.\n\nHilchot Nikkur (the excision of fatty tissue known as \"suet\" from the slaughtered animal) - by Rabbi Yehuda Sa'adi \n\nInsomuch that I have seen in this, our orphaned generation, all of us groping like blind men to find the suet and its [appointed] places, and its [required] removal by excision, [not knowing] which of these [places] are to be judged strictly, and which of them are to be judged leniently; as also the [required] removal of the sinew [of the two hind legs], and the membranes, as also the \"threads\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which are forbidden under the category of \"suet,\" my heart has, [therefore], taken it upon itself to write what I have known about them, perchance those seeing my writing will give answer and show me the way of truth, and cause me to understand where I may have erred.\n\nAll of the exponents of our laws whom I have known agree to [this] one opinion, that there are three fatty tissues (suet) which, [by eating], men would become liable to extirpation, and they are that which men offer to God [upon the altar]. They are the suet which lies upon the innards, and the suet (fat) which is upon the kidneys, and the suet which is upon the flanks. The suet which is upon the innards is that which is spread as a blanket over the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. \"Kores\"), which includes that which is upon the omasum (Heb. \"Messos\") and the reticulum (Heb. \"Beith Hakossoth\"). That which is upon the kidneys is as it is implied, whose place is known; while that which is upon the flanks is that which is below the kidneys towards the hind side of the animal, attached to the fat of the kidneys, and which is [called in Aramaic] \"Tarba de-Aqlivusta\", where the joint of the hind legs (Aramaic: \"Deleifan Atmatha\") is located, and which is the suet at the root of the thighs from within. Thus is it written by Maimonides, and by Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, as also the author of \"Halachot Gedolot\". Included in this [category] is the suet which [clings] to its side, spreading itself upon the flanks at both sides of the animal.\n\nAs for the meaning of \"Aqlivusta,\" Rashi has explained [it as being] the small bone lying on that bone which, [in French], is called \"hanche\" (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the vertebrae of the tail [of the sheep]. But Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi explained [it as] that bone which holds fast all the [other] bones, while the \"Kol Bo\" has written Rashi's explanation under his name. Yet, the [book known as] \"Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot\" (\"Hasemag\") has written [under] the prohibitive command # 138, \"Tarba de-Aqlivusta\": Rashi has explained the \"Qaliboseth\" (i.e. tail bone) as being the small bone lying on that bone which is called [in French] \"hanche\" (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the vertebrae of the tail [of the sheep] from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks.\n\nNow these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: \"Near the tail can be found the [edible] fat of the sheep's tail, upon which is the suet of the \"Qaliboseth\" (i.e. tail bone), and that same suet and [edible] fat of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc.\" But in [the book] \"Sheiltot\" of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, and in [the book] \"Halachot Gedolot\", they have written: \"The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the \"Qaliboseth\" (i.e. tail bone), where the hind legs attach themselves.\" Likewise has Maimonides, of blessed memory, written: \"[It is] the suet which is at the joints of the hind legs from within.\" Yet, in [the book] \"Sefer Hazikkaron\", he explained \"Tarba de-Aqlivusta\" as the place where the thighs are attached, etc., while in an Arabic commentary on the laws governing Ritual Slaughter [we find] that \"Qaliboseth\" [means] \"\"al-falakh\".\"\n\nNow what we have received as being the way to surgically remove all fatty tissue [is as follows]: After undressing the animal, they tear away the outer ruminant stomach from the hind legs unto the chest-wall cavity, and they take out the inner stomach, and remove, in its entirety, the blanket-like covering [of suet] which is spread out over it. And they take special precautions over the thin [layer of] suet which is connected to the large intestines, which is at the end of [that place called], the \"coils of the ileum\" (Heb. \"Hadar Hakanoh\"), near the place where he excretes excrement, [and] which, on the one side, the \"suet of the innards\" is attached, while on the other side, the fat of the \"kanoh\" (ileum). That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the \"Geonim\", of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. \"Senei Dhebei\" = \"hatred of wolves\"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the abomasum (Heb. \"Kevah\") externally, which is known as the \"ḥūmṣā\", until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called \"bar ḥūmṣā\". Now that which is spread over the omasum (Heb. \"Messos\") [and the reticulum] like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the \"suet which lies upon the innards.\" Now they scrape away [all suet] from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.), it also being the suet of the small intestines which is prohibited according to [Maimonides], (Nachmanides) and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails (intestines), and the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. \"Kores\"), as well as the liver, aside from the mesentery (Heb. \"Ḥalūḥelet\"), for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white [tissue] which is in the centre of the diaphragm (Heb. \"Tarfash\") [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], extending downwards unto the thighs [of the hind legs and] running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the spinal column (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the loins, which is called \"\"lonbel\"\" in the foreign, [French] language and \"mutemaziqah\" in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. \n\nAfterwards, they pull out the five \"threads\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks, these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate [veins], while the two [\"threads\"] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate [veins], while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the \"threads (nerves) that are in the hip,\" the \"threads of the walls [of the chest],\" and the \"threads that are upon the flanks,\" their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the spinal column, beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the [forbidden] fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the [edible] fat that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from [the two sides of] the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending [outwards] until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, [it is permitted]. They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called [in Arabic] \"mutemaziqah\", and they excise [the fatty tissue from] the \"mutemaziqah\", [surgically removing] all of the [forbidden] fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the kidneys from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the diaphragm (Heb. \"Tarfash\") [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the [pelvic] bone that joins together the two thighs, [separating the two thighs], taking out all fat that is within it [and which] lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the [forbidden] \"fat that is upon the flanks,\" or what is also called [in Aramaic] \"Tarba de-Aqlivusta\". They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue to scrape away the outer part of the fatty tail (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the \"threads\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. \"Peqoqeloth\") [in the loins], which in Arabic is [known as] \"al-falakh\" (Coccyx), along with the \"threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the perforations in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the spinal cord. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its flesh on that side where the hide is attached, until the displaced tendon (Heb. \"Gid Hanasheh\") can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on [that part of] the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] \"mukheh\", [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the calf [of leg] which is called [in Arabic] \"sā‘ed\", [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews [in the calf] (Heb. \"Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm\"), called [in Arabic] \"suqleh\", with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] \"mukheh\" and in its socket [what are known as] stems (Heb. \"Qenuqenoth\"), as well as the fat (Heb. \"Shoman\") of the displaced tendon, [both] being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away. Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the spleen, let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the \"threads\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them. The inner ruminant stomach (Heb. \"Kores\"), the omasum (Heb. \"Messos\") and the reticulum (Heb. \"Beith Hakossoth\"), (as well as the rump of sheep), require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the diaphragm (Heb. \"Tarfash\") [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of suet, and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They [also] remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, [as also the tunic membrane that envelope the testes]. As for the \"threads\" (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them, seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces. Now may God deliver us from errors, and instruct his servants in the way of truth. Amen, may it even be His will.\nOriginal:\n\nהמקור\n\nדיני ניקור שחיבר הרב הגדול כמהר\"ר יהודה בן כמהר\"ר שלמה צעדי זצוק\"ל וזה לשונו\n\nלפי שראיתי בדורינו הדור היתום הזה, כולנו מגששים כעורים בהכרת

{"id": "20767027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20767027", "title": "Faggot (food)", "text": "Faggot (food)\n\nFaggots are meatballs made from minced off-cuts and offal, especially pork (traditionally pig's heart, liver, and fatty belly meat or bacon) together with herbs for flavouring and sometimes added bread crumbs. It is a traditional dish in the United Kingdom, especially South and Mid Wales and the English Midlands.\n\nFaggots originated as a traditional cheap food consumed by ordinary country people in Western England, particularly west Wiltshire and the West Midlands. Their popularity spread from there, especially to South Wales in the mid-nineteenth century, when many agricultural workers left the land to work in the rapidly expanding industry and mines of that area.\nFaggots are also known as \"ducks\" in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Lancashire, often as \"savoury ducks\". The first use of the term in print was in the \"Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser\" of Saturday 3 June 1843, a news report of a gluttonous man who ate twenty of them.\n\nThe first use of the term in print, as cited in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", dates from 1851, in a piece by Henry Mayhew in which he describes a dish identical to the modern product with chopped liver and lights in an outer wrapper of caul. This was in London.\n\nCommonly, a faggot consists of minced pork liver and heart, wrapped in bacon, with onion and breadcrumbs. Often, the faggot is cooked in a crock with gravy and served with peas and mashed potato. The mixture is shaped by hand into small balls, wrapped with caul fat (the omentum membrane from the pig's abdomen), and baked. Faggots may also be made with beef.\n\nAnother variation of the faggot is pig's fry (testicles) wrapped in pig's caul: the pig's fry and boiled onions are minced (ground) together, then mixed with breadcrumbs or cold boiled potatoes, seasoned with sage, mixed herbs and pepper, all beaten together and then wrapped in small pieces of caul to form a ball. They are then baked in the oven and are usually served cold.\n\nThe dish gained in popularity during the rationing in World War II, but declined over the following decades. The \"nose-to-tail eating\" trend has resulted in greater demand for faggots in the 21st century; British supermarket chain Waitrose once again sold beef faggots from 2014 onwards and in 2018 it was estimated that \"tens of millions\" of faggots were eaten every year. Faggots are often homemade and are to be found in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot; this is a frozen food product available in the UK, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce. These differ significantly from traditional faggots, which have a coarser texture and contain far less water.\n\nA popular dish is faggots and peas. This combination is common in the Black Country area of the West Midlands. It is still common to see small butchers' shops in the area selling faggots cheaply, made to their own recipe.\n\nThe use of the word \"faggot\" has caused controversy due to its additional meaning as a pejorative term for a homosexual man in American English. In 2004, a radio commercial for the UK supermarket chain Somerfield, in which a man rejects his wife's suggested dinner saying \"I've got nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them\" was found to have breached the Advertising and Sponsorship Code and was banned by the industry regulator Ofcom.\nIn November 2013, it was reported that British Facebook users had been blocked temporarily for using the word, in its culinary sense, on the website. Facebook said that the word had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\n"}

Cochranian Witchcraft has several features that separate it from other traditions such as Gardnerian Wicca, such as its emphasis on mysticism and philosophy, and Cochrane's attitude that it was not pagan, but only based upon paganism.\n\nAs in most forms of Neopagan Witchcraft, Cochranians worship both a Horned God and a Triple Goddess. The Goddess is viewed as the White Goddess, a term taken from Robert Graves' poem, \"The White Goddess\". She is also viewed as a triad of three mothers or three sisters, which both Cochrane and Evan John Jones noted as having similarities with the weird sisters or Norns of Germanic paganism.\n\nIn Cochrane's Craft, the God is associated with fire, the underworld and time, and has been described as \"the goat-god of fire, craft, lower magics, fertility and death\". The God was known by several names, most notable Tubal Cain, Brân, Wayland and Herne. Cochrane's tradition held that these two deities had a son, the Horn Child, who was a young sun god.\n\nCochrane, like Gardner, believed that there was a being beyond the God and the Goddess; the Godhead, although he referred to this deity as \"the Hidden Goddess\". He also referred to it as \"Truth\".\n\nCochrane told of a cosmogony myth, which involved Night, \"a feminine being with force, but without form, giving birth to man and with him she discovered love, and so all things began\". He said that the Elder Gods had seven children who each created a realm to rule over from a castle, as well as creating the elements of earth, air, fire and water, each of which had a god ruling over it.\n\nIn a letter to occultist William G. Gray, Cochrane said:\n\nCochranians wear robes whilst performing rituals and adhere to the traditional Great Rite.\n\nAround the time that the British 1735 Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, and it became legal to practice witchcraft in the United Kingdom, Cochrane, who was in his early twenties, founded a coven, and named it the \"Clan of Tubal Cain\" after the biblical figure Tubal-cain (the first blacksmith), as a reference to his work in that profession.\n\nCochrane initiated his wife Jane and several others into the craft, and they then joined the coven. Among these was Evan John Jones, who would later become an author upon the subject of pagan witchcraft. Jones had met Cochrane through his wife Jane, as they both worked at the same company.\n\nThe group performed their rituals either at Cochrane's house, or, more often, at Burnham Beeches, though they also performed rituals at the South Downs, after which they would stay the night at Doreen Valiente's flat in Brighton.\n\nDescribing his creation of his Witchcraft tradition, one of its later adherents, Shani Oates, remarked that \"Like any true craftsman, he was able to mold raw material into a magical synthesis, creating a marvelous working system, at once instinctively true and intrinsically beautiful.\"\n\nIn 2015 a feature film, \"The Coven\" was released based on the premise that \"Robbie Cochrane founded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s\" and that followers were meeting in Queen's Wood in Highgate. A Cochranian devotee, Uri Clef, is killed and the films plot reveals the killer in a subtle and complex story line.\n\n"}

The Teacher's Highland Cream brand was registered in 1884. (The label on the bottles says \"est. 1830\", reflecting an earlier date when the founding family entered the whisky business, before the brand name was created.) Teacher's states that it uses \"fully smoked peat single malt whisky from The Ardmore distillery as its fingerprint whisky\" along with about 30 other single malt whiskies. Most of the output of the Ardmore distillery is used to produce the Teacher's brand.\n\nIn 1830, William Teacher took advantage of the new \"Excise Act\" and began selling whisky. From 1832 he was selling it from his wife's grocery shop in Glasgow. By 1856, with help from his sons, he was granted a licence for consumption and opened his own dram shop. He died in 1876, leaving his two sons William Jr and Adam in charge of the company, known as William Teacher & Sons Ltd. They moved the business to St. Enoch Square, where it remained until 1991. The company opened its Ardmore distillery in 1898, ensuring a guaranteed supply of Scotch for its Teacher's Highland Cream blend. The brand entered the US market after the end of Prohibition in the United States; the first shipment of Teacher's was sent on the Cunard steamer \"Scythia\". Teacher & Sons acquired the Glendronach distillery in 1960 and built a modern blending and bottling plant in Glasgow in 1962.\n\nIn 1976, Teacher & Sons was bought by Allied Breweries, which became part of Allied Lyons in 1978 and then Allied Domecq in 1994. The Glendronach distillery was shut down in 1996 and was later sold off to Chivas Brothers after being reopened in 2002. In 2005, Allied Domecq was taken over by Pernod Ricard. Beam Inc. acquired Ardmore and the Teacher's brand, along with Laphroaig distillery on Islay.\n\nIn 2014, Beam was purchased by Suntory to form Beam Suntory.\n"}

It is distinguished from other Swiss breads by a very soft, porous dough and a mealy, crunchy crust.\n\nThe age of the recipe is uncertain. The \"Basler Brot\" was first described in a bakers' journal in 1944. After a marketing campaign by the Swiss Bakers Association in the 1950s, it was made available in all Swiss bakeries.\n\nProduction of the \"Basler Brot\" begins the day before baking with the production of the \"Hebel\", a mother dough that is left to ripen overnight, producing the bread's characteristic aroma. It is then mixed with plain flour, salt, yeast and water to produce a dough with a very high water content (over 80%), making the bread very soft.\n\nAfter a light kneading, the dough is formed into rough pieces, which are weighed and laid on flour-dusted wooden bards for half an hour. They are only lightly rolled into an oval shape, which allows for the dough's large pores to form, and then baked for at least half an hour at up to Usually, two loaves are baked attached point to point, and steam is used to prevent a premature hardening of the crust, which should – unlike the loaf pictured above – not crack during baking.\n\nDistributed nationally through the retailers Migros and Coop, \"Basler Brot\" is eaten in all of Switzerland as an everyday food. It is also sold in the area near Basel in Alsace (France) and Lörrach (Germany)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20782736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20782736", "title": "Opsis", "text": "Opsis\n\nOpsis () is the Greek word for spectacle in the theatre and performance. Its first use has been traced back to Aristotle's \"Poetics.\" It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the mise en scène of a performance or theatrical event.\n\nOpsis comes from the ancient Greek for \"appearance, sight, view.\" The English word optic is derived from this word.\n\nAristotle's use of the term opsis, as Marvin Carlson points out, is the \"final element of tragedy,\" but the term \"receive[d] no further consideration\". Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics, but only goes as far as to suggest that \"spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet\".\n\nIn \"Theories of the Theatre\" by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent \"spectacle,\" but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in \"Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis\" Opsis is listed in the \"terms\" section, and defined as:\nthat which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the notions of \"spectacle\" and \"performance\". In Aristotle's \"Poetics, spectacle\" is one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the performance. \"Opsis\" is a spectific feature of the performing arts.\n\nJ. Michael Walton, in \"The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed\", challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that “the visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.” Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word.\n\nRonald W. Vince, suggests that while it may \nseem logical simply to recognize \"opsis\" as stage spectacle or the \"mise-en-scene\" and so include it — if anywhere — in the vocabulary of performance theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible interpretation which would link \"opsis\" with the art of writing plays as well as with the art of staging them.\n"}

Unlike most other breads, which are mainly composed of flour, yeast and water, the \"Burebrot\" also contains milk.\n\nThe bread is made by mixing rye and wheat flour, water, salt, yeast and a leavening agent into a dough, which is formed into a round shape. After 70 to 90 minutes, the surface is cut with a knife to create a decorative lozenge pattern and the bread is baked first at a high, then at a moderate temperature until the crust is crunchy.\n\nDespite its name, the \"Burebrot\" is of relatively recent origin: it was developed in 1955 by the \"Ecole Professionnelle de Richemont\" in cooperation with the Swiss Bakers' Association as a way to make use of surplus milk. It is now available in most Swiss bakeries and supermarkets as a bread for everyday consumption. As a bread developed by professionals, it is not usually made at home.\n\n\n"}

Detailed descriptions of the pastry are found in late 19th-century sources and match the contemporary appearance of the \"Murren\" closely. Research by Swiss food historians indicates that the \"Murren\" were a specialty of Zürich's bakers up until the 20th century, at which time they became popular in other parts of Switzerland, with the exception of Ticino where they are almost unknown. Up until late into the 20th century, \"Murren\" were a treat for feasts, as white flour was too expensive for everyday consumption by most people.\n\nWhile the breadroll is known as \"Zürcher Murren\" (or \"Zürimurre\" in the local dialect) in the canton of Zürich, it is referred to as \"Berner Weggli\" or \"Weggen\" (\"Bernese breadrolls\") in the canton of Berne and in the Romandie, and under generic terms such as \"Spitzweggen\" (\"pointy breadrolls\") elsewhere in Switzerland. The etymology of the word \"Murren\" is unclear. It may be derived from Middle High German \"murr\" (\"blunt\"), from Spanish or Portuguese \"morro\" (\"round\") or from Dutch \"murw\" (\"brittle\").\n\nLike the \"Weggli\", another traditional Swiss breadroll, \"Murren\" are made of white flour, milk, butter, yeast, a pinch of salt and sugar, malt and a leavening agent. These ingredients yield a stringy, elastic dough that is allowed to rise for 30 minutes, before it is mechanically divided into small pieces.\n\nThe pieces are again allowed to rise for half an hour in a heated closet, and are then superficially sliced with a special tool to produce five cuts that result in the \"Murren\"s characteristic points after baking. The \"Murren\" are coated with eggyolk and baked at for 20 minutes, until they are a golden brown colour.\n\n\"Murren\" are best when freshly baked, as the dough is quick to dry out. They are traditionally eaten at breakfast with jam, honey or butter; or as a snack with a chocolate \"branche\". The five spikes are the \"Murren\"'s hardest part and may hurt the palate of incautious eaters.\n\nCommercially, \"Murren\" are less significant than the similar and more popular \"Weggli\", although they are generally available in bakeries and supermarkets across northern and central Switzerland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20785826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20785826", "title": "Sentence word", "text": "Sentence word\n\nA sentence word (also called a one-word sentence) is a single word that forms a full sentence.\n\nHenry Sweet described sentence words as \"a variety of words which have the peculiarity of always forming a sentence by themselves\" and gave words such as \"Come!\", \"John!\", \"Alas!\", \"Yes.\" and \"No.\" as examples of sentence words. The Dutch linguist J. M. Hoogvliet described sentence words as \"volzinwoorden\". They were also noted in 1891 by Georg von der Gabelentz, whose observations were extensively elaborated by Hoogvliet in 1903; he does not list \"Yes.\" and \"No.\" as sentence words. Wegener called sentence words \"Wortsätze\".\n\nOne of the predominant questions concerning children and language acquisition deals with the relation between the perception and the production of a child's word usage. It is difficult to understand what a child understands about the words that they are using and what the desired outcome or goal of the utterance should be.\n\nHolophrases are defined as a \"single-word utterance which is used by a child to express more than one meaning usually attributed to that single word by adults.\" The holophrastic hypothesis argues that children use single words to refer to different meanings in the same way an adult would represent those meanings by using an entire sentence or phrase. There are two opposing hypotheses as to whether holophrases are structural or functional in children. The two hypotheses are outlined below.\n\nThe structural version argues that children’s “single word utterances are implicit expressions of syntactic and semantic structural relations.” There are three arguments used to account for the structural version of the holophrastic hypothesis: The comprehension argument, the temporal proximity argument, and the progressive acquisition argument.\n\n\n→ Child: \"Daddy\" (holding pair of fathers pants)\n\nThe usage of 'Daddy' and 'Bai' used in close proximity are seen to represent a child's knowledge of linguistic relations; in this case the relation is the 'possessive'. This argument is seen as having insufficient evidence as it is possible that the child is only switching from one way to conceptualize pants to another. It is also pointed out that if the child had knowledge of linguistic relationships between words, then the child would combine the words together, instead of using them separately.\n\n\nFunctionalists doubt whether children really have structural knowledge, and argue that children rely on gestures to carry meaning (such as declarative, interrogative, exclamative or vocative). There are three arguments used to account for the functional version of the holophrastic hypothesis: The intonation argument, the gesture argument, and the predication argument.\n\n\n→ Child: \"Ball.\" (flat intonation) - Can mean \"That is a ball.\"\n\n\n→ Child: \"Milk.\" (points at milk jug) - could mean “That is milk.” \n\n\nWhile children use sentence words as a default strategy due to lack of syntax and lexicon, adults tend to use sentence words in a more specialized way, generally in a specific context or to convey a certain meaning. Because of this distinction, single word utterances in children are called 'holophrases', while in adults, they are called 'sentence words'. In both the child and adult use of sentence words, context is very important and relative to the word chosen, and the intended meaning.\n\nMany sentence words have formed from the process of devaluation and semantic erosion. Various phrases in various languages have devolved into the words for \"yes\" and \"no\" (which can be found discussed in detail in yes and no), and these include expletive sentence words such as \"Well!\" and the French word \"Ben!\" (a parallel to \"Bien!\").\n\nHowever, not all word sentences suffer from this loss of lexical meaning. A subset of sentence words, which Fonagy calls \"nominal phrases\", exist that retain their lexical meaning. These exist in Uralic languages, and are the remainders of an archaic syntax wherein there were no explicit markers for nouns and verbs. An example of this is the Hungarian language \"Fecske!\", which transliterates as \"Swallow!\", but which has to be idiomatically translated with multiple words \"Look! A swallow!\" for rendering the proper meaning of the original, which to a native Hungarian speaker is neither elliptical nor emphatic. Such nominal phrase word sentences occur in English as well, particularly in telegraphese or as the rote questions that are posed to fill in form data (e.g. \"Name?\", \"Age?\").\n\nA sentence word involves invisible covert syntax and visible overt syntax. The invisible section or \"covert\" is the syntax that is removed in order to form a one word sentence. The visible section or \"overt\" is the syntax that still remains in a sentence word. Within sentence word syntax there are 4 different clause-types: Declarative (making a declaration), exclamative (making an exclamation), vocative (relating to a noun), and imperative (a command).\n\nThe words in bold above demonstrate that in the overt syntax structures, there are words that can be omitted in order to form a covert sentence word.\n\nOther languages use sentence words as well.\n\n\n"}

The brand and its original distillery are now part of Diageo, the world's largest spirits company and a major producer of beer (Guinness) \nHaig offers four whiskies:\n\nKane McKenzie Haig founded a distillery in the early 1720s in the Kennetpans near Stirling, which became Scotland's largest distillery by 1733. It has been called the world's first commercial distillery. Stein had taken over some land and distilling operations from a local monastery. (Stein's distillery is now in ruins, and fund-raising was attempted in early 2015 in an effort to try to preserve its remnants.)\n\nRobert Haig was a distiller in the early 1600s and a member of the Scottish Clan Haig family. His great-grandson Kane McKenzie Haig, who lived in the Kennetpans area, married Margaret Stein of the Stein family in 1751 and founded the company known as John Haig & Co.\n\nTheir daughter, also named Margaret, married a local lawyer John Jameson from Alloa in 1788. On marriage, John and Margaret Jameson moved to Dublin to run a new Stein family distillery in Bow Street which had been opened in 1780. Contrary to popular belief, the Jameson Irish Whiskey company was not actually founded in 1780, but in 1810 when John Jameson bought the distillery from his wife's cousins, the Steins. The original Jameson Distillery in Bow Street is now home to the Jameson Visitor Centre. The Stein, Haig, and Jameson families were significant figures in the whisky market from that time forward.\n\nA Haig distillery, now known as the Cameronbridge distillery, was founded in 1824. In 1830, it became the first distillery to produce grain whisky using the column still method invented by Robert Stein in 1826 (before the later better-known refinement developed by Aeneas Coffey).\n\nJohn Haig & Co. was subsequently merged into the Distillers Company Limited (DCL) in 1877.\n\nDCL combined with John Walker & Son and Buchanan-Dewar in 1925 and was then acquired by Guinness in 1986, which put it into its United Distillers subsidiary in 1987. Guinness then merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997.\n\nMost current variations of the Haig brand are produced using spirits from Diageo's Glenkinchie distillery and Linkwood distillery.\n\nHaig was bottled in a distinctive three-sided bottle with dimpled sides, starting in the 1890s. The bottle was registered as a trademark in the US in 1958 by Julius Lunsford. It and the bottle design for Coca-Cola (which was also registered by Lunsford) were the first two bottle designs to appear in the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nOne of their best known advertising slogans was \"Don't be vague, ask for Haig.\"\n\nAnother was \"an inch of Pinch, please!\"\n\nHaig Whisky Club\n"}

It is often directly translated as \"bondservant\", although sometimes also rendered as \"slave\" (\"nucai\").\n\nPamela Kyle Crossley wrote in her book \"Orphan Warriors\": \"The Mongol is the slave of his sovereign. He is never free. His sovereign is his benefactor; [the Mongol] does not serve him for money.\" This Mongolian \"traditional model of slave to owner\" was taken up by the Manchu during the development of the Eight Banner military system.\n\nCrossley gave as the definition of \"Manchu\": \"A Manchu was, moreover, a man who used his skills exclusively to serve the sovereign...banners as institutions were derived from Turkic and Mongolian forms of military servitude, all enrolled under the banners considered themselves slaves of the emperor and called themselves so (\"aha\", Chinese:奴才, pinyin:nucai) when addressing him...\".\n\nIn his book \"China Marches West\", Peter C. Perdue stated: \"In 1624 (after Nurhaci's invasion of Liaodong), Chinese households who had 5 to 7 Manchu sin of grain (800 to 1,000 kg) were given land and houses, while those with less were made into slaves.\" The Manchu established a close personal and paternalistic relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhaci said: \"\"The Master (Chinese:主子) should love the slaves and eat the same food as them\"\". Perdue further pointed out that booi aha \"did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of \"bondservant-slave\" (Chinese:奴僕); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate \"booi\" as \"bondservant\".\n\nIn the book \"A History of Chinese Civilization\", Jacques Gernet pointed out that Chinese agricultural slaves were employed as early as the fifteenth century, and by the late sixteenth century it was observed that all the Manchu military commanders had both field and house servants. Between 1645 and 1647, Qing rulers enclosed (Chinese:圈地) large numbers of previously Chinese owned estates over vast areas of North China, eastern Mongolia and neighborhood of Peking, and for land cultivation they were using a labor force consisting of bondservants which were previous land owners and prisoners of war. According to Gernet, regardless of repeated calls from the leader Nurhaci that \"The Master should love the slaves\", Manchu slave masters treated their slaves very harshly, arranged numerous corvees (Chinese:徭役, 强迫的劳役), and sold and bought their slaves as if they were animals.\n\n\"Booi\" was sometimes regarded as synonymous with \"booi aha\", but \"booi\" usually referred to household servants who performed domestic service, whereas \"aha\" usually referred to the servile people who worked in fields.\n\nThe number of booi aha of the Imperial Household Department seems to have risen mainly during the Nurhaci's conquest of the eastern fringes of the Liao River basin in the 1610s and 1620s, resulting in the massive increase of the numbers of captives. In 1618, Nurhaci increased the Jurchen state's population by 300,000 by the taking of Fu-shun. This large increase of its population changed the policy on booi aha. During the first year of conquest(to 1624), the captured Chinese were generally enslaved, and bore obligations to private persons, while later (in 1624-1625) they were often enrolled in the ranks of the semi-dependent agriculture class, jusen, who bore obligations to the state. Freeholder status was given to Li Yongfang's 1,000 troops after his surrender of Fushun, and the later Chinese Bannermen (Hanjun, or Han Bannermen) Bao Chengxian and Shi Tingzhu also experience good fortune in Qing service after their surrenders in 1622 at Guangning.\n\nThe Aha were made out of enslaved Jurchens, Koreans, Han Chinese, and Mongols before 1616, they then became part of the booi (bondservants) attached to Manchu Banners, there is no evidence that after 1621 most of the booi were Han Chinese despite the mistaken view held by many of this topic, many different ethnic groups were booi including Koreans and ethnic Manchu bondservants as well. Both Koreans, Han Chinese, and Jurchens who were prisoners of war or abducted became part of the Aha, the forerunner of the booi (bondservants) in the Banners, although the Jurchens integrated into their own some of the earlier captured Han Chinese and Koreans. The Jianzhou Jurchens accepted some Han Chinese and Koreans who became Jušen (freeholders) on Jianzhou land. Russians, Koreans, Manchus, and Han Chinese were all bondservants in the Imperial Household. Some lands for farming in Manchuria were used to dump soldiers after the position of kaihuren was assigned to former booi. The Imperial Exam resulted in the bureacracy receiving some important booi while others fled as there was a drastic drop in booi population. The Imperial court saw the rise of the Han Chinese booi Cao Yin.\n\nThe Manchu \"Booi Aha\" (Home slaves) system was the origin of the \"Neiwufu\" (Chinese:內務府) or Imperial Household Department organization. The personnel of this department came from the booi of the Manchu Eight Banner's upper three banners: \"Border Yellow\", \"Plain Yellow\" and \"Plain White\".\nThe highest official's title was Dorgi Baita Icihiyara Amban, a Manchu term (Chinese:总管内务府大臣), a position mostly occupied by Manchu princes.\n\nThe Upper Three Banners of the Neiwufu (Chinese:内務府上三旗) (Manchu:booi ilan gusa) was a unique military system of Manchu. Apart from providing the clothing, food, housing and transportation for the operating of daily functioning of the imperial family, it also had a military function, which is to provide military protection for the inner imperial court.\n\nIn the Qing court, the number of eunuchs was reduced to less than 10% of that of Ming court because eunuchs were replaced by booi, the Qing imperial court's home servants.\n\n\nChinese scholar Mo Dongyin (Chinese:莫东寅) in his \"Essays on Manchu History\" (Chinese:《满族史论丛》) wrote that \"booi\" has a dual meaning: (1) Household servants, and (2) slaves. But in Manchu society, booi (Chinese:包衣) occupied a special class, in which they serve their masters by doing all kinds of manual work and at the same time, with the permission from the master (Chinese:主子), can enslave other booi, thus becoming masters themselves.\nWith the establishment of the Qing dynasty and the maturity of its political system, booi were organized into Booi Gusa (Manchu: Slave Banner) and incorporated into both the Eight Banners Army and the Imperial Household Department. Booi had since become part of the Qing dynasty political hierarchy, with the emperor being the Master, and emperor's booi working for the Master and the imperial court simultaneously. When addressing the emperor, booi would refer to themselves as \"Nupu\" or \"Nucai\" (Chinese:奴僕, or Chinese:奴才). But when booi were addressing others, even though they were \"Nucai of the emperor\" (Chinese:皇帝的奴才), they would refer to themselves as \"Superior officials of the Han Chinese\" (Chinese:汉人的长官).\n\nIt was possible for Han Bannermen and Han bondservants (booi) to become Manchu by being transferred into the upper three Manchu Banners and having their surname Manchufied by adding a \"giya\" 佳 at the end as a suffix. The process was called 抬旗 in Chinese. It typically occurred in cases of intermarriage with the Qing Aisin Gioro Imperial family, and the close relatives (fathers and brothers) of the concubine or Empress would get promoted from the Han Banner to the Manchu Banner and become Manchu.\n\n\n"}

In Ticino, it is referred to by a number of names specific to the region, including \"pane riga\", \"reale\" or \"lireta\".\n\nThe bread is distinguishable by its shape—it is composed of several small loaves or rolls made to be broken off by hand—and by the addition of oil to the dough, which makes the bread particularly soft.\n\nUp until the early 20th century, \"pane ticinese\" and other white breads were luxury foods that most \"Ticinesi\" could not afford; bread made from rye or chestnut flour was the usual fare in the Ticino mountain villages.\n\nThe 1930s book \"Atlas of Swiss Folklore\" notes that the white bread made in the Ticino is distinguished from other breads by its \"Reihenform\", or sequential form: it is composed of a number of small loaves attached to each other that are intended to be broken off by hand. One of its names in a local dialect, \"riia pan\" (\"bread in a line\") reflects this shape. This shape of bread was originally brought to Ticino from Italy, where it has been known for a long time. A 1584 painting by the Italian artist Annibale Carracci depicts a man eating at a table and, to his right, a bread very similar to \"pane ticinese\".\n\nAccording to the \"Atlas of Swiss Folklore\", the \"Pane ticinese\" of that time weighed 1 kilogram (2 lb) and was composed of eight loaves; it was sold whole or in parts (one half, a quarter, one eighth or one sixteenth), which were easily produced by breaking individual loaves off the bread.\n\nThe bread was made popular in the rest of Switzerland in the 1950s by the Swiss Bakers' Association, whose professional school at Richemont in Lucerne developed a range of specialty breads based on the baking traditions of each canton.\n\n\"Pane ticinese\" is made of a dough of water, white flour, \"biga\" (a mixture of flour, yeast and water), salt, and (in the contemporary recipe only) some oil. After being kneaded, the dough is divided into round pieces of about 2 kg, which are left to rise for a few minutes before being re-kneaded, flattened and formed into small individual loaves, or \"michette\" (plural of \"michetta\"). Each \"michetta\" is shaped by hand into an oval shape of about 10 cm in length, and attached to other \"michette\" to form a complete loaf.\n\nAfter being brushed with egg, the loaves are again allowed to rise until their volume has doubled, then baked for about 20 to 25 minutes at a temperature of , until the crust is a golden brown.\n\n\"Pane ticinese\" is enjoyed as a bread for everyday use. Available in most Swiss bakeries and supermarkets, it is typically sold as a composite loaf of four to six pieces weighing 250 grams, with an overall length of 20 to 25 centimeters. When stale, it is used in Ticino to make \"torta leventinese\", a form of bread pudding.\n\n\n"}

Huaraches are also often paired with fried cactus paddles, although the historical reason for this is unclear. This dish is most popular in its hometown of Mexico City and is also sold in cities with Mexican-American populations such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston, but have yet to become widely available across the entire United States. Still, huaraches and other Mexican dishes have increased their presence in the Midwest due to increasing numbers of Latinos in rural America.\n\nThe name \"Huarache\" is derived from the shape of the masa, similar to the popular sandals of the same name. The word Huarache is originally from Purépecha and the Nahuatl word for huarache is kwarachi. Huaraches are similar to sopes and tlacoyos but differ in shape.\n\nHuaraches originated in Mexico City in about the early 1930s. Their origin was at a stall along La Viga navigation channel, where Mrs. Carmen Gomez Medina prepared \"tlacoyos\". When the navigation channel was covered to make the \"Calzada de la Viga\", Mrs. Gomez moved to another place and after 1957, when the Mercado de Jamaica was founded, she moved there, and then to a little place at Torno street. Because Mrs. Gomez's new invention was shaped differently than a sope or a tlacoyo, people started to call it \"huarache\".\n\n"}

It is similar to the Central European kopytka. They take various forms and can be referred to with a variety of names in different regions. They are usually made from rye or wheat flour and egg. Since the introduction of the potato to Germany in the seventeenth century, Schupfnudeln have also been made with potatoes. They are traditionally given their distinctive ovoid shape through hand-shaping. They are often served as a savory dish with sauerkraut but are also served in sweet dishes.\n\nSchupfnudeln have been known as a trooper dish since the Thirty Years' War: out of their daily flour ration and water the soldiers formed long noodles, which they cooked afterwards. After the potato was imported to and cultivated in Germany in the 17th century, the recipe was modified and different variations emerged according to different regions.\n\nThough they can be found throughout Germany, they are especially popular in the cuisine of Baden and Swabia. There, in addition to Schupfnudeln they are called \"Baunzen\" or \"Bubenspitzle\" (literally meaning \"little boys' penis\").\n\nIn Bavarian cuisine they are known as \"Fingernudeln\" (finger noodles), \"Dradewixpfeiferl\", Kartoffel- or \"Erdepfebaunkerl\" (potato \"Baunkerl\") or \"Schupfnudeln\", and in Upper Palatinate they are called \"Schopperla\" or \"Schoppala\".\n\nIn the Odenwald their name is \"Krautnudeln\" (cabbage noodles) and in the Palatinate they are called \"Buwespitzle\". The \"Bauchstecherla\" in Franconia are a bit thinner and more pointed.\n\nA special variety of these noodles is called \"Mohnnudeln\" (poppy seed noodles) and can be found throughout Bavaria and Austria.\n\nThe name \"Schupf\"- or \"Fingernudel\" refers to the form and shape of the noodle and not to the ingredients. There is no universally authentic recipe but many widely different ways of preparation according to region. Many of these variations claim to be the original and authentic \"Schupfnudeln\".\n\nThis disagreement about method is reflected in the subject literature. The Duden (reference book of German language) says that the \"Schupfnudel\" is a fried dish while Ludwig Zehetner writes in his Bavarian Dictionary that one should boil it in salt water.\n\nSimple recipes only use rye flour and water for the dough, but many recipes include mashed potatoes, wheat flour and egg. The dough is kneaded and then rolled into a long, thin cylinder. This roll is cut into pieces about half an inch in width. These are rolled the typical shape of Schupfnudeln. Afterwards they are either cooked in salty water for about ten minutes or deep-fried. Many recipes include frying them in a pan afterwards as well.\n\nSubsequently they are served in different ways: savory with sage-butter or sauerkraut or sweet with poppy seeds, sugar and cinnamon. In all cases it is necessary that the comparatively flavorless noodles incorporate the flavor of the other ingredients. Schupfnudeln can be served either as a side dish or as a main dish.\n\nSchupfnudeln pan-fried with bacon bits and sauerkraut are commonly served at public wine festivals throughout Baden and Swabia. In Swabia, Schupfnudeln are often served with cold fruits, like cold stewed apples or pears.\n\n"}

The dish consists of chopped eels boiled in a spiced stock that is allowed to cool and set, forming a jelly. It is eaten cold.\n\nThe eel was a cheap, nutritious and readily available food source for the people of London; European eels were once so common in the Thames that nets were set as far upriver as London itself, and eels became a staple for London's poor. The earliest known eel, pie and mash houses opened in London in the 18th century, and the oldest surviving shop, M Manze, has been open since 1902. At the end of the Second World War there were around 100 eel, pie and mash houses in London; in 1995 there were 87.\n\nThe water quality of the Thames has improved since the 1960s and is now suitable for recolonisation by eels. The Environment Agency supports a Thames fishery, allowing nets as far upriver as Tower Bridge.\n\nThe dish is traditionally prepared using the freshwater eels native to Britain. Typically, the eels are chopped (shucked) into rounds and boiled in water and vinegar, to make a fish stock, with nutmeg and lemon juice before being allowed to cool. The eel is a naturally gelatinous fish so the cooking process releases proteins, like collagen, into the liquid which solidify on cooling to form a jelly, though gelatin may be added in order to aid this process. Recipes for jellied eels are individual to particular London pie and mash shops, and also street sellers; however, traditional recipes for authentic Victorian jellied eels all have common ingredients and cooking methods. What varies is the choice of herbs and spices used to flavour the dish.\n\nJellied eels are often sold with pie and mash, another traditional East End food, and eaten with chilli vinegar or with malt vinegar and white pepper.\n\nIn Denmark the dish is known as \"ål i gele\", in France as \"aspic d'anguille\", in Germany as \"Aal in Aspik\", and in Poland as \"węgorz w galarecie\"; all terms mean jellied eel. In Sweden the dish is named \"ålaladåb\", after the French term \"à la daube.\"\n\nIn the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\", jellied eels are often referred to as Alan Parry (father of Cassandra)'s favourite food. Also, Del Boy and Jumbo Mills ran a jellied eel shop in the ‘60s called “Eels on Wheels.”\n\nIn the 2012 game \"Dishonored\", a product called \"Pratchett Jellied Eels\" appears as a food staple in the game's 19th centuresque fictional universe.\n\nThe character Owen Harper on the BBC show \"Torchwood\" pretends to be a jellied eel magnate while undercover in the Series 1 episode \"Combat\".\n\nJack Johnson, a black early 20th century heavyweight boxing champion, notoriously defied taboos by consorting with white women, among other behaviours. Asked the secret of his staying power by a reporter who had watched a succession of women parade into, and out of, the champion's hotel room, Johnson supposedly said, \"Eat jellied eels and think distant thoughts\".\n\nIn Neil Gaiman's novel \"Stardust\", the character Quintus died after eating jellied eels that had been poisoned by his youngest brother Septimus.\n\nIn The Mighty Boosh the mysterious cockney Hitcher discusses and sings a song about eels, presumably jellied eels, as he refers to eating them for free at an East London pie and mash shop.\n\nIn P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster novels and Blandings Castle novels (set in the early 20th century), the narrator sometimes refers to \"jellied eel sellers\" in a manner which implies the typical jellied eel seller is a disreputable fellow, but without further explanation.\n\nIn the television series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\", in the episode \"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest\" (Season 3, Episode 8), Poirot dispatches Captain Hastings to the Military Club, where Hastings makes inquiries of a young staff boy who is eating food purchased from a London street vendor that sells jellied eel.\n\n\n\n"}

The rules for Canasta were standardized in North America around the 1950s, it was this version of the game that gained worldwide popularity. In many countries, Classic Canasta is still played in more or less its original form, sometimes alongside a number of variations.\n\nIn North America, however, some players have continued to develop the game. There are several variations of Ponytail Canasta, but no official version has ever been sanctioned. This is not Hand and Foot Canasta (that's another variation) but there are similarities.\n\nCanasta is generally agreed to be best for four players playing in partnerships. However, there are playable versions for two, three, or four partnerships. These additional player partnerships call for additional decks of cards\n\nCanasta is normally played with standard 52 card decks plus two jokers.\n\nThe cards A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 are called natural cards. All of the deuces (twos) and jokers are wild cards. With some restrictions, wild cards can be used during the game as substitutes for a natural card of any rank.\n\nThe threes have special functions and values: Black threes are used as discards as they cannot be picked up. Black three's (3♠ / 3♣) held in a player's hand at the end of the game count minus 100 points (subtracted from the player's score). Red threes (3 ♥ / 3 ♦) are not to be used to meld a Canasta, but are set into the meld area and have a value of 100 points each.\nBlack three's may only be melded by the player going out at the end of the hand with three or more threes.\n\nBasic Ponytail Canasta may be played with four or six players and six decks of cards.\nEach additional player adds one deck of cards.\n\nAfter the dealer is determined in some fashion. All decks are shuffled into a single large deck (a Shuffling machine is often used). The player to the right of the dealer cuts the decks after the shuffle.\nThe dealer then takes a group of card from the top of the deck and deals 15 cards, in a clockwise manner, for each player. He passes each player the \"hand\" for that player. If the player cutting the cards cuts the exact number of cards for 4 players + one card for the discard pile, that pair gets a 100 pt. bonus. The player to the left of the dealer takes a stack of card from the large deck and deals out 13 cards for each player also clockwise.\n\nHe places these 13 card \"Pony Hands\" in front of each player. The remaining cards from each dealer's pile are returned to the deck. The top 40-50 cards from the deck are placed in the card distribution caddy in the center of the table. The remaining cards are set aside, to be used to replenish the distribution stack as it gets low.\n\nThe top card from the distribution stack is turned over and placed in the discard tray. If this first face-up card is wild or a red three, another card is turned and places on top of it, continuing until a card which is not a wild card \nor red three is turned up; the wild card or red three should be stacked at right angles to the rest of the pile, to indicate that the discard pile is frozen (see Frozen Discard Pile below). The next and consecutive games, the dealer and Ponytail dealer tasks shift one person to the left. This shift continues until the game ends.\n\nThe player to the left of the dealer plays first, and then the turn to play passes clockwise. \nA basic turn consists of drawing two cards from the top of the distribution stack, adding them to their hand without showing it to the other players. After drawing, but before discarding, players may sometimes be able to play some cards from their hand face up on the table. To play cards to the table in this way is known as melding, and the sets of three cards or more, so played, are \nmelds. These melded cards remain face up on the table until the end of the play. Melding to make Canastas is the object of the game, making as many Canastas as possible. Discarding one card from a players hand face up on top of the discard pile completes each player's turn.\n\nUnder certain conditions, instead of drawing from the distribution stack, players are permitted to take the whole discard pile. In order to do this, players must be able to meld the top discard. The top card and only the top card with at least two cards from their hand, must be used to make the meld. Or, if a player already has a meld of cards of the same type as the discard, except wild cards, they may pick up the discard pile and use the top card. Afterward, the meld any of the other cards from the discard pile may be used in current melds or to make new melds. Players can pick up the discard pile if they have a natural card of the same value as the top card and one wild card (unless the discard pile is frozen), melding the top card with the natural card and wild card from their hand.\n\nThe procedure in this case is :\n\nThere are three ways that the discard pile can be frozen :\n\nWhen the discard pile is frozen, a player can only take it if they hold in their hand two natural cards of the same rank as the top card of the discard pile, and use these with the top discard to make a meld. This meld can either be a new one, or could be the same rank as an existing meld, in which case the melds are then merged. For example, if the pile were frozen and the player already has a meld of four Jacks on the table. If the previous player discards a Jack, the next player cannot pick up the discard pile unless they have two Jacks concealed in their hand. If they do have two Jacks in their hand, they can add them and the discarded Jack to their meld (making a Canasta), and take the rest of the discard pile.\n\nThe object of the game is to score points by melding cards. A valid meld consists of three or more cards of the same rank (any rank from four up to ace), such as three kings, six fives, etc. Melds belong to the team partnership, not to an individual player. They are kept face up in front of one of the partners. Typically, a partnership will have several melds, each of a different rank. A player can add further cards of the appropriate rank to any of their side's melds, whether begun by them or by their partner, however they can never add cards to an opponent's meld.\n\nWild cards (jokers and twos) can normally be used in melds as substitutes for cards of the appropriate rank. For example, Q-Q-Q-2 or 8-8-8-8-2-joker would be valid (dirty) melds. There must always be more natural cards than wild cards in the meld at any time with a maximum of three wild cards in any one meld. For example, a meld of 6-6-2-2 would not be allowed. \"Threes cannot be melded at any time\".\n\nFor each partnership, during a hand when they put down one or more melds, is called their initial meld. When making the initial meld for their partnership, players must meet a certain minimum count requirement, in terms of the total value \nof cards that they put down. Players are allowed to count several separate melds laid down at the same time in order to meet this requirement. The initial meld must be made entirely from their hand after they draw, or from their hand plus the top card of the discard pile to satisfy the minimum count, before picking up the remainder of the pile. Before players have made their initial meld, the discard pile is frozen to them, they must have two naturals of the same value in their hand to pick it up.\n\nThe initial meld requirement applies to a partnership, not to an individual player. Therefore, after either a player or their partner have made a meld that meets the requirement, both of them can meld freely or add cards to an existing meld for the rest of that hand.\n\nEach team must make its own initial meld, meeting the required point value for that team. That is to say each team can have a different minimum point value for their initial meld, based on the teams accumulated score from previous hands. If a players partnership has not yet melded, then in order to meld, the total value of the cards they lay down must meet a minimum count requirement. This requirement depends on their partnership's cumulative score from previous hands.\n\nTo achieve the count, players create several melds at once; the melds can be of more than the minimum size of three cards. The standard values of the cards played are added together to reach the requirement. It is the card value that counts (if a player were to lay down seven 4's making a Canasta, the point value toward the minimum requirement would only be 35 (seven times 5 points) not 500 points for the Canasta). Once the minimum point value is reached, then the Canasta is made and counts 500 points at the end of the hand.\n\nA Canasta is a meld of seven cards. If all of the cards in it are natural, it is called a \"natural\" or \"red Canasta\"; the cards are squared up and a red card is placed on top. The Canastas are all grouped together in front of the player. If the Canasta includes one or more wild cards it is called a \"dirty\" or \"black Canasta\"; it is squared up with a natural black card on top.\n\nIn Ponytail Canasta, melds of more than seven cards are not allowed. Players cannot add cards to a previously formed Canasta, as in some other variations of Canasta. After players have made melds and successfully created their first Canasta, they may pick up their 13-card ponytail that has been sitting in front of them since the original deal. They can continue their play by melding or adding to existing melds with cards from the Ponytail. Cards from the ponytail not melded are added to their hand and a discard completes the turn.\n\nThe game ends is the phase when a player loses, \"goes out\". To go out, and be awarded the 200-point bonus, a player disposes of all the cards in his or her hand. A player can only go out after they have fulfilled the minimum required conditions as described below. A player can go out by melding all but one of the cards in their hand and discarding the last card or by melding the entire hand, leaving no discard. The game can also end if the distribution deck runs out of cards.\n\nA team must have all of the following Canastas:\n\n\nWhen the play has ended the hand is scored. Each player's score for the hand consists of:\n\n\nAfter the bonuses have been calculated, the cards used in the Canastas and the melds for each player are counted using the standard card values. The cards remaining in the hands of the players are also counted using the same standard values, but these points count against the player and are subtracted from their score. A cumulative total score is kept for each player. It is possible to have a negative score. The game ends when a player has a total of 50,000 or more points at the end of a hand or 4 hands have been played, and the player with the higher total score wins. The margin of victory is the difference between the scores of the players.\n"}

Sunflower butter is commonly used as a substitute for peanut butter when allergies are a concern.\n\nU.S. commercial versions of sunflower butter were first introduced in the early 1980s as alternatives to peanut butter, particularly for those with nut allergies or peanut allergies. These attempts were unsuccessful, which was attributed to issues with its greenish appearance, \"poor texture\", and a bitter, under-roasted taste.\n\nTwo decades later, in 2000, researchers at the Agricultural Research Service of the Department of Agriculture, working with sunflower seed processor Red River Commodities, developed a formulation that \"resembled the texture, flavor, and nutty appearance of commercially available peanut butter\", focusing on the degree of roasting and the amounts of sugar, salt, and stabilizer (hydrogenated cottonseed and rapeseed oils). At the same time, Red River Commodities invested in new sunflower seed hybrids and specialized production areas, formed the subsidiary SunGold Foods, Inc., and created a peanut-free and tree-nut-free food processing, packaging, distribution and shipping environment at both companies' locations. The substitute for peanut butter, introduced in 2002, became known as SunButter.\n\nBy 2011, SunButter became available at major grocery retailers such as Kroger, SuperValu, Walmart, Target, and Whole Foods.\n\nSeveral major grocery chains and online retailers produce store-band sunflower butter, including Trader Joe's and Thrive Market.\n\nSunflower seeds are a good source of protein, fiber, vitamin E, zinc and iron.\n\nThey are also rich in alpha-tocopherols, which have been associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancers.\n\nDue to the prevalence of peanut allergies in the US, many schools there are offering peanut-free menu options or implementing entirely nut-free policies. Sunflower butter can provide an alternative in schools where peanut butter and other nuts have been banned. However, a small number of people with peanut allergies may also be allergic to sunflower seed butter. According to one study, a person with a known peanut allergy suffered an acute reaction to a \"nut-free\" butter containing sunflower seeds.\n\nSunflower butter can also be used as a dip for fruit and vegetables, in a sandwich, or in recipes that call for peanut butter; although peanut butter contains higher levels of protein.\n\n"}

It was conceived and founded by actor Dan Aykroyd and artist John Alexander in 2007.\n\nThe vodka is quadruple-distilled and seven times filtered, with the final 3 filtrations through Herkimer diamond crystals, which are actually a type of double-terminated quartz rather than diamond. The Crystal Skull bottle was designed by John Alexander and is manufactured by Milan-based glass-manufacturer Bruni Glass.\n\nAykroyd and Alexander first conceived of the idea for Crystal Head Vodka in 2007. Due to the lack of additive-free vodka on the market, Aykroyd decided to make one himself. Alexander designed the bottle based on the pair's shared fascination with the legend of the thirteen crystal skulls.\n\nIt took two years to execute the manufacture of the bottle, made by Milan-based glass manufacturer Bruni Glass. Crystal Head launched in Southern California in 2008 and launched in four other states shortly after. It was sold in the rest of the United States in 2009 before becoming available worldwide.\n\nCrystal Head Vodka was in development at the same time as the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\". Sensing a conflict, Aykroyd arranged to meet with Steven Spielberg to discuss resolving the issue. To Aykroyd's surprise, Spielberg suggested that he would have liked Crystal Head Vodka to be served at the premiere.\n\nIn 2010, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario refused to carry Crystal Head Vodka in its stores, saying that people might find the bottle offensive. They later reversed their decision after a change was made to the box design.\n\nIn May 2011, 21,000 bottles of the vodka were stolen from a warehouse in Southern California. Aykroyd joked that he was \"happy that some consumers will be afforded the opportunity of tasting it at significantly lower than retail price\".\n\nIn 2013, Aykroyd was spending over 90 days a year on the road promoting the vodka through signings and appearances. The brand was the official vodka of the Rolling Stones 50th Anniversary Tour in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, Crystal Head Vodka released Crystal Head Aurora, a line extension to the Crystal Head vodka brand. Aurora is manufactured by Globefill Incorporated at the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation distillery in Newfoundland, Canada. English wheat from North Yorkshire, England is processed and distilled five times in a traditional column still. The raw spirit is then reduced with Newfoundland water to 40% alcohol by volume. Unlike Crystal Head Vodka, Aurora is filtered using activated charcoal; this unique filtration lasts 6 hours to remove any impurities. Aurora is then filtered three times through Herkimer diamonds. Aurora uses a final micro filtration prior to being bottled.\n\nThe original bottle is manufactured by Milan-based glass-manufacturer Bruni Glass.\n\nBruni Glass also manufacture the \"Aurora\" bottle. The original Crystal Head Vodka bottle is placed in a sealed chamber and electrically charged. Two metals in powder form are then activated and released into a pressurized chamber. The powder is drawn to the electrically charged bottle, completely coating it. The bottles are then baked at a high temperature melting the powder and creating the iridescent metalized finish. No two Aurora bottles are alike.\n\nThe defect rate on the bottle production is about 40% on the 750 ml. Higher on the larger sizes. 3 litre size is closer to 70%. This can be compared to less than 0.5% defect rate on normal bottles.\n\nIn 2014, forensic artist Nigel Cockerton used clay to make a muscle, skin and hair construction on one of the skull bottles to see what it would look like if the bottle had been an actual person. The end result resembled a laughing man. Dan Akroyd was pleased with the face, although he had previously thought of the bottle as being feminine due to its size, and had nicknamed the bottle Joy due to the joy it brought him. He said he was relieved that the face didn't turn out to look like him.\n\nCrystal Head Vodka is manufactured by Globefill Incorporated at the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation distillery called Rock Spirits in Newfoundland, Canada. \"Peaches and Cream\" corn grown in the Chatham-Kent region of Ontario is processed and distilled four times to produce a neutral grain spirit at 95% alcohol by volume. The raw spirit is then reduced with Newfoundland water to 40% alcohol by volume. The liquid is then filtered seven times of which three are through Herkimer diamonds. These raw stones are quartz crystals, which have been ascribed untested, unfounded healing properties such as \"amplifying spirit energy\" by some new age belief systems. This proprietary filtration process claims to account for the smoothness of the vodka, however this has yet to be verified by any type of study. Crystal Head does not use any additives—glycerol, citrus oil, or sugar—in the production of their vodka. The factory and product is certified kosher, as well as gluten-free.\n\n\n"}

Aside from pork, bologna can be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, venison, a combination, or soy protein. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, and coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor. U.S. government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground and without visible pieces of fat.\n\nLebanon bologna is a Pennsylvania Dutch prepared meat. While nominally bologna, it is a dried, smoked sausage similar to salami.\n\nRing bologna is much smaller in diameter than standard bologna. It is better suited for slicing and serving on crackers as a snack or \"hors d'oeuvre\". It is generally sold as an entire link rather than sliced. The link is arranged as a semicircle or \"ring\" when prepared for sale (hence the name). Pickled bologna is usually made from ring bologna soaked in vinegar and typical pickling spices. It is usually served in chunks as a cold snack.\n\nRag bologna is a long stick, or \"chub\", of high-fat bologna traditionally sold wrapped in a cloth rag. The recipe has a higher content of filler than that of regular bologna. Milk solids, flour, cereal, and spices are added during processing, and the roll of bologna is bathed in lactic acid before being coated in paraffin wax. This type of bologna is native to West Tennessee and the surrounding regions and is not commonly available outside this area. It is generally eaten on white bread with mustard and pickles, but is also a staple of family gatherings, where thick slices are smoked and barbecued along with other meats. In Newfoundland, a type of rag bologna referred to as \"wax\" bologna is sliced thickly and fried, which is referred to as \"Newfie steak\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"polony\" is a finely ground pork-and-beef sausage. The name, likely derived from Bologna, has been in use since the 17th century. The modern product is usually cooked in a red or orange skin and is served as cold slices.\n\nSouth African \"polony\" is similar to bologna in constitution and appearance, and is typically inexpensive. Large-diameter (artificially coloured) pink polonies are called French polony, with thinner rolls referred to simply as polony. Garlic polony is also widely available.\n\nIn 2018, a South African factory that produced polony and other processed meats was associated with the deadliest listeriosis outbreak in history, that sickened 1000 people, and killed at least 180.\n\nVarious vegetarian and vegan versions of bologna are available. A typical UK recipe uses soya and wheat protein in the place of lean meat and palm oil instead of fat together with starch, carrageenan, and flavorings. It can be eaten cold or cooked in the same ways as traditional bologna.\n\n"}

Sometimes the sandwich is eaten open-faced, or with one slice of bread folded over (effectively a \"half sandwich\"). The sandwich is quite common and popular in North America, especially for children; a 2002 survey showed the average American will have eaten 1,500 of these sandwiches before graduating high school. Smuckers manufactures a commercial sealed crustless sandwich made of peanut butter and jelly.\n\nThere are many variations on the sandwich; for example, honey or sliced fruit can be substituted for the jelly component. Marshmallow fluff can also be substituted for the jelly, or simply added for extra flavor; this sandwich is called a \"fluffernutter\". On the flip side, the popularity of almond butter has inspired some aficionados to transition to \"almond butter and jelly\" (AB&J) sandwiches; other nut butters are less common. Cream cheese, substituted for the peanut butter, makes a \"cream cheese and jelly\" (CC&J) sandwich. Nutella is another possible substitute for one of the spreads, either N&J or PB&N.\n\nWhite bread is most commonly used, but whole wheat bread can be used as an option. Creamy peanut butter and jelly yields a very smooth sandwich, chunky peanut butter and jam makes for a lot of chunks, while chunky peanut butter and jelly offers up a lot of contrasting texture. The sandwich may be served whole or cut. If the sandwich is left to sit, or prepared in the morning for a midday meal, then the jelly or jam may soak into the bread and create a soggy slice. The solution invented by sandwich-makers is to utilize the \"barrier strategy\", whereby a layer of peanut butter on each slice protects the bread from becoming soggy (see photo for \"sandwich preparation\").\n\nPeanut butter was originally paired with a diverse set of savory foods, such as pimento, cheese, celery, watercress, saltines and toasted crackers. In a \"Good Housekeeping\" article published in May 1896, a recipe \"urged homemakers to use a meat grinder to make peanut butter and spread the result on bread.\" The following month, the culinary magazine \"Table Talk\" published a \"peanut butter sandwich recipe. In the early 1900s, this sandwich was adopted down the class structure as the price of peanut butter dropped. It became popular with children by the 1920s as manufacturers began adding sugar to the peanut butter. Since World War II, both peanut butter and jelly were found on US soldiers' military ration list. The National Peanut Butter and Jelly Day occurs annually in the United States on April 2.\n\nA peanut butter and jelly sandwich made with white bread, two tablespoons each of peanut butter and strawberry jelly, provides 403 kcal, 18 g fat, 58 g carbs and 12 g protein which is 27% of the Recommended Daily Intake of fat and 22% of calories.\n\nWhile roughly 50% of the calories are from fat, most of them come from monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fats, which have been linked positively with heart health.\n\n\n"}

In 2006 this recipe was taken up by Gerry Jones of Liverpool and developed with a view to the tart becoming as widely known and appreciated as the Bakewell and Manchester tarts. In 2008 it was being produced as a regular line by two bakeries in Merseyside, Satterthwaites in Crosby and Dafna's Cheesecake Factory in south Liverpool. The original recipe called for \"½lb moist sugar, 2oz butter, 1 egg, 1 lemon, pastry\".\n\nCurrent thinking is that \"moist\" sugar meant dark muscovado, while the lemon may be shredded (after removal of the pips) instead of \"boiling and mincing\". Once the basic tart is baked and setting, thought is then given to a decorative finish. The original \"cross bar over\" is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top, but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool's Liver Bird in one form or another. It is possible to buy bespoke pastry cutters which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste. While these produce the most attractive tarts, they do add yet another level of sweetness, and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms. Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template, which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart, then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view. This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness.\n\n\n"}

It is made with an unleavened, water based dough, pressed and cooked like corn tortillas. In Spanish the word \"tortilla\", without qualification, has different meanings in different regions. In Spain it is an omelette; in Mexico and Central America it is a corn tortilla; and in many other places a flour tortilla.\n\nFlour tortillas are commonly prepared with meat, chopped potatoes, refried beans, cheese and other ingredients to make dishes such as tacos, quesadillas and burritos (a dish originating in the Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico / El Paso, Texas area).\n\nTortillas are also very similar to the unleavened bread popular in Semitic, eastern Mediterranean and southern Asian countries, though thinner and smaller in diameter. In China, there is the laobing (烙餅), a pizza-shaped thick \"pancake\" that is similar to the tortilla.\n\nThe wheat flour tortilla is probably best known as the tortilla and it is used to make burritos, amongst other things. Wheat tortillas have also become a staple of both northwestern Mexican states (such as Sonora, Sinaloa and Chihuahua) and throughout the Southwestern United States.\n\nTortillas vary in size from about 6 to over 30 cm (2.4 to over 12 in), depending on the region of the country and the dish for which it is intended.\n\nIn commercial production and even in some larger restaurants, automatic machines make tortillas from dough.\n\nAccording to Maya legend, tortillas were invented by a peasant for his hungry king in ancient times. The first tortillas discovered, which date back to approximately 10,000 BC, were made of native maize with dried kernel. The Aztecs used a lot of maize, both eaten straight from the cob and in recipes. They ground the maize, and used the cornmeal to make a dough called \"masa\".\n\nOn 22 April 1519, Spaniards led by Hernán Cortés, also known as Hernando Cortez, arrived in what is now Mexico. They found that the inhabitants (Aztecs and other native Mexican peoples) made flat maize bread. The native Nahuatl name for this was \"tlaxcalli\".\n\nIn Cortés' 1520 second letter to King Charles V of Spain, he described the public markets:\n\"This city has many public squares, in which are situated the markets and other places for buying and selling. . . where are daily assembled more than sixty thousand souls, engaged in buying and selling; and where are found all kinds of merchandise that the world affords, embracing the necessaries of life, as for instance articles of food. . . maize or Indian corn, in the grain and in the form of bread, preferred in the grain for its flavor to that of the other islands and Terra-firma\".\nThis bread made from maize was later given the name \"tortilla\" (little cake) by the Spanish. In parts of southern Spain, the origin of many of the Spaniards conquering America, a \"tortilla\" or \"tortillita\" is a crisp, thin, circular, fried cake made of chickpea meal. These tortillas, which apparently have their roots in southern Spain's Arabic heritage which Arabs brought Spain from Greek foods, look strikingly similar to the fried maize tortilla (or tostada).\n\nFranciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún described how the Aztec diet was based on maize, tortillas, tamales and a wide variety of chiles. Sahagún noted that the Aztecs not only used corn in their tortillas, but also squash and amaranth, and that some varieties used turkey eggs or honey as a flavoring.\n\nTraditionally, maize tortillas were made from nixtamalized maize; kernels were soaked in a solution of lime (calcium hydroxide) and water to remove their skins; this also increases the bioavailability of then-unknown niacin. The grains were then ground into maize dough (\"masa\"). A golf ball-sized piece of dough was patted down by hand into a thin pancake shape, placed on a hot griddle (\"comal\"), and cooked on both sides. This tortilla-making process is still used today in southern Mexico.\n\nTo meet the needs of big cities and the modern lifestyle, the traditional process was mechanized to increase production of tortillas. In the 1940s and 1950s, one of the first widespread uses of small gas engines and electric motors was to power wet-grain grinders for making \"masa\". A hand press or hand patting were still used to form it into tortillas, but by the 1960s, small-scale tortilla-making machines could produce cooked tortillas every two seconds.\n\nToday, personal and industrial (Mexican-style) tortilla-making equipment has facilitated and expedited tortilla making. Manually operated wooden tortilla presses of the past led to today's industrial tortilla machinery, which can produce up to 60,000 tortillas per hour. Tortillas are now not only made from maize meal, but also from wheat flour; home-made and store-bought tortillas are made in many flavors and varieties.\n\nTortillas remain a staple food in Mexico and Central America, and have gained popularity and market share elsewhere. In the U.S., tortillas have grown from an \"ethnic\" to a mainstream food. They have surpassed bagels and muffins, and have now become the number two packaged bread product sold in the U.S (behind sliced bread). The Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimates, in the U.S. alone, the tortilla industry (tortillas and their products – tortilla chips, tostada shells and taco shells) has become a $6 billion a year industry.\n\nSoft wheat tortillas use wheat instead of masa as the primary ingredient. The Mission Foods brand lists the following ingredients: Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Water, Vegetable Shortening (Interesterified Soybean oil, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil and/or Palm Oil), contains 2% or less of: Salt, Sugar, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium aluminum sulfate, Corn starch, Monocalcium phosphate and/or Sodium acid pyrophosphate, Calcium Sulfate), Distilled Monoglycerides, Enzymes, Wheat Starch, Calcium Carbonate, Antioxidants (Tocopherols, Ascorbic acid, Citric acid), Cellulose gum, Guar gum, Dough conditioner (Fumaric acid, Sodium Metabisulfite and/or Mono- and Diglycerides), Calcium propionate and Sorbic acid (to preserve freshness).\n\nThe nutritional info for the Mission brand 49g wheat tortilla is:\n\nWheat flour tortillas have been used on many American spaceflights since 1985 as an easy solution to the problems of handling food in microgravity and preventing bread crumbs from escaping into delicate instruments.\n\nThe word \"tortilla\" in these countries is used to refer to the ubiquitous corn tortilla. made of maize. In Mexico burritos are made with wheat tortillas. Flour Tortillas were also very popular in Tex-Mex food and plates like Fajitas. Flour Tortilla with Bean and Eggs was very popular in northern Mexico and in the Southwest. The origin of the flour Tortilla was Northern Mexico and this is why so many plates are made with it like Quesadillas as well as Burritos, Chimichangas and Fajitas served with Flour Tortilla and Bean Taco or Chorizo Taco. The Flour Tortilla is the sister to the Corn Tortilla which was created first. From Mexico City Southward the Corn Tortilla is more popular but in Northern Mexico where the Flour Tortilla originated the Flour Tortilla maybe just as popular if not more popular than the Corn Tortilla.\n\nHonduras is well known for using wheat flour tortillas to make baleadas, which consist of a wheat flour tortilla, folded in half, with various items (beans, cream, scrambled eggs) put inside.\n\nMaize and wheat tortillas can often be found in supermarkets in El Salvador and Costa Rica produced by Mexican companies.\n\nIn Northern Mexico and much of the United States, \"tortillas\" mean wheat-flour tortillas. They are the foundation of Mexican border cooking. Their popularity was driven by the low cost of inferior grades of wheat flour provided to border markets and by their ability to keep and ship well.\n\nIn Guam, it is called \"titiyas\" and it is paired with kelaguen mannok.\n\nTortilla art is the use of tortillas as a substrate for painting. Tortillas are baked and then covered in acrylic before they are painted.\n\nTortillas in Central America sometimes differ somewhat from their Mexican counterparts, although are made similarly. In Guatemala and El Salvador, the tortillas are about 5 millimeters thick and about 10 centimeters in diameter, just like Mexican gorditas. Like the Mexican tortillas, the maize is soaked in a mixture of water and lime (or lye), then rinsed and ground. In El Salvador, they sometimes use sorghum (called maicillo there) to make tortillas when there is not enough maize. Also in El Salvador, there is a particularly large and thick tortilla called a \"chenga\" on top of which food is placed, like an edible plate, to serve food to the labourers in coffee plantations and farms.\n\nStuffed tortillas known as pupusas are also a famous dish of traditional Salvadoran cuisine.\n\nTortillas are widely used in the United States, in recipes of Mexican origin and many others. They are commonly used in burritos. As a testament to their popularity, the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimated Americans consumed approximately 85 billion tortillas in 2000 (not including tortilla chips).\n\nTortilla chips — made from maize tortillas cut into wedges, then fried — first gained popularity in the 1940s in Los Angeles, California and were mass-produced there. The ingredients in maize tortillas are maize, lime, and water. Fried chips add salt and vegetable oil.\n\nFlour tortillas are also used to make fajitas, wraps, sandwiches, casseroles and stews, and there are numerous other uses.\n\nMany people from both Northern Mexico and throughout the Southwestern United States eat tortillas as a staple food. Many restaurants use wheat flour tortillas in a variety of non-Mexican and Mexican recipes. Many grocery stores sell ready-made tortillas.\n\n"}
{"id": "21183599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21183599", "title": "Bündner Nusstorte", "text": "Bündner Nusstorte\n\nThe Bündner Nusstorte (Graubünden nut pastry), also known as Engadiner Nusstorte, is a traditional sweet, caramelised nut-filled pastry (generally walnut) from canton Graubünden in Switzerland. The modern filled Nusstorte was first widely available in the 1960s though it was invented in the 1920s. While the Nusstorte is associated with Graubünden, the nuts are always imported because Graubünden's climate will not support nut trees.\n\nWhile there are recipes for \"Nusstorte\" from the 19th century, they are different from the modern \"Nusstorte\". These pastries contained nuts mixed into a dough, but were not filled. The modern, filled \"Nusstorte\" was developed by an Engadin (a region in Graubünden) baker named Fausto Pult in 1926. In 1934 he sold the pastries at the \"Mustermesse\" in Basel, which introduced them to the wider world.\n\nBecause the climate in Graubünden is too cold for nut trees to thrive, the origin of nuts in their pastries is subject to some debate. One theory is that a baker, who had lived in France, brought nut trees back with him which he was able to plant in Val Bregaglia. Another theory, that comes up often in the literature, is that the traditional shortcrust pastry \"Fuatscha Grassa\" was crossed with a French nut pastry by confectioners from Graubünden living in France. When they returned to Graubünden, the idea was brought along. A third theory is that during the Middle Ages many confectioners from Graubünden moved to Venice and for 300 years specialized in sweets. When they were expelled in 1766, the Graubünden confectioners traveled around Europe before many of them settled back in Graubünden. The idea of nut pastries could have easily come from one of these wandering cooks.\n\nThe Bündner Nusstorte is commonly made by small independent bakers scattered throughout Graubünden. For this reason, there are a variety of recipes, some of which are closely guarded secrets. The basic pastry is made of a classic shortcrust pastry, which contains flour, sugar, egg, butter and a bit of salt. The filling is made of caramelized sugar, to which heavy cream or milk and coarsely chopped nuts (commonly walnuts but rarely other nuts) are added. Some recipes include a little milk or honey.\n\nThe Bündner Nusstorte is produced throughout the entire canton and is one of the largest export items for independent bakers. It is estimated that Nusstorten sales represent 20 to 40% of the total sales for many bakers and are a major source of income.\n\nThe Nusstorte, with a buttery crust and cream and nut filling, is loaded with calories. They are generally cut into pieces and eaten for dessert together with coffee or tea. They can be purchased throughout the year and are widely available over the internet. The Nusstorte will remain fresh for several months, which makes them popular as gifts and allows them to be shipped around the world.\n\n"}

{"id": "21207241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21207241", "title": "Burrito", "text": "Burrito\n\nA burrito (, ) is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that consists of a flour tortilla with various other ingredients. It is wrapped into a closed-ended cylinder that can be picked up, in contrast to a taco, where the tortilla is simply folded around the fillings. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself when wrapped. A wet burrito, however, is covered in sauce and is therefore generally eaten with silverware.\n\nIn Mexico, meat and refried beans are frequently the only fillings. In the United States, however, burrito fillings may include a large combination of ingredients such as Spanish rice or plain rice, boiled beans or refried beans, lettuce, salsa, meat, guacamole, cheese, sour cream and various vegetables. Burrito sizes vary greatly and some can be very large.\n\nThe word \"burrito\" means \"little donkey\" in Spanish, being the diminutive form of \"burro\", or \"donkey\". The name \"burrito\", as applied to the dish, possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a lot.\n\nIn other regions of Mexico, such as in the state of Tamaulipas, similar types of food are known as \"flautas\" (flute).\n\nBefore the development of the modern burrito, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas in 10,000 B.C. to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados. Historically, the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito. But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco, rather than the modern burrito.\n\nThe precise origin of the modern burrito is not known. Some have speculated that it may have originated with \"vaqueros,\" the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century. In the 1895 \"Diccionario de Mexicanismos\", the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the Mexican state of Guanajuato and defined as \"Tortilla arrollada, con carne u otra cosa dentro, que en Yucatán llaman \"coçito\", y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico, \"taco\"\" (A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called 'coçito' in Yucatán and 'taco' in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City).\n\nAn oft-repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan Méndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez during the Mexican Revolution period (1910–1921), while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food. To keep the food warm, Méndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth. As the \"food of the \"burrito\"\" (i.e., \"food of the little donkey\") grew in popularity, \"burrito\" was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos.\n\nAnother creation story tells of Ciudad Juárez in the 1940s, where a street food vendor created the tortilla-wrapped food to sell to poor children at a state-run middle school. The vendor would call the children his \"\"burritos\"\", because \"burro\" is a colloquial term for a \"dunce\" or \"dullard\". Eventually, the somewhat derogatory, but endearing, term for the children was transferred to the food that they ate.\n\nIn 1923, Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora Cafe in Los Angeles, which later changed its name to El Cholo Spanish Cafe. Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe in Los Angeles during the 1930s. Burritos were mentioned in the U.S. media for the first time in 1934, appearing in the \"Mexican Cookbook\", a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico that was written by historian Erna Fergusson. In 1956, a frozen burrito was developed in Southern California.\n\nBurritos are a traditional food of Ciudad Juárez, a city bordering El Paso, Texas, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, where people buy them at restaurants and roadside stands. Northern Mexican border towns like Villa Ahumada have an established reputation for serving burritos. Authentic Mexican burritos are usually small and thin, with flour tortillas containing only one or two of several ingredients: either some form of meat or fish, potato, rice, beans, asadero cheese, \"chile rajas\", or \"chile relleno\". Other ingredients may include: \"barbacoa\", \"mole\", refried beans and cheese (a \"bean and cheese\" burrito), or \"deshebrada\" (shredded slow-cooked flank steak). The \"deshebrada\" burrito has a variation with \"chile \" (mild to moderately hot) and one with \"salsa verde\" (very hot). The Mexican burrito may be a northern variation of the traditional \"taco de Canasta\", which is eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nAlthough burritos are one of the most popular examples of Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico, they are only popular in the northern part of Mexico. However, they are beginning to appear in some nontraditional venues in other parts of Mexico. Wheat flour tortillas (used in burritos) are now often seen throughout much of Mexico (possibly due to these areas being less than optimal for growing maize or corn), despite at one time being particular to northwestern Mexico, the Southwestern US Mexican-American community, and Pueblo Indian tribes.\n\nBurritos are commonly called \"tacos de harina\" (\"wheat flour tacos\") in central and southern Mexico, and burritas (the feminine variation with 'a') in \"northern-style\" restaurants outside of northern Mexico proper. A long and thin fried burrito called a \"chivichanga,\" which is similar to a chimichanga, is prepared in the state of Sonora and vicinity.\n\nA variation of the burrito found in the Mexican state of Sonora is known as the burro percherón.\n\nThe origins of the Mission burrito or Mission-style burrito can be traced back to San Francisco, in the Mission District taquerías of the 1960s and 1970s. This type of burrito is produced on a steam table assembly line, and is characterized by a large stuffed flour tortilla wrapped in aluminum foil, and may include fillings such as carne asada (beef), Mexican-style rice, whole beans (not \"refritos\"), sour cream and onion.\n\nFebronio Ontiveros claims to have offered the first retail burrito in San Francisco in 1961 at \"El Faro\" (\"The Lighthouse\"), a corner grocery store on Folsom Street. Ontiveros claims credit for inventing the \"super burrito\", a style which may have led to the early development of the \"San Francisco style\". This innovative style involves the addition of rice, sour cream and guacamole to the standard burrito of meat, beans, and cheese. The Mission burrito emerged as a regional culinary movement during the 1970s and 1980s. The popularity of San Francisco-style burritos has grown locally at Mission Street taquerias like \"El Farolito\", and nationally at chains like Dos Toros of New York, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Illegal Pete's, Chevy's Fresh Mex, Freebirds World Burrito, Qdoba, and Barberitos. Chili's had a brief stint with \"Fresh Mex\" foods and burritos between 2015 and 2017. In 1995, World Wrapps opened in San Francisco's Marina District and brought a burrito-inspired wrap style to the restaurant industry.\n\nSan Diego-style burritos include \"California burritos\" and carne asada burritos. The style has been described by food writers as an \"austere meal of meat, cheese and salsa\", a contrast to the Mission-style burrito, which is typically larger and always contains more ingredients. A significant subgroup of Mexican restaurants in San Diego serves burritos described as \"no-frills\" and, in contrast to Mission-style burritos, the assembly line is not used.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Roberto Robledo opened a \"tortilleria\" in San Diego and learned the restaurant business. Robledo began selling small bean burritos (or \"burrititos\") at \"La Lomita\" in the late 1960s, and by 1970, he had established the first \"Roberto's taco shop\". By 1999, Roberto's restaurants had expanded to a chain of 60 taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality. Hoping to draw on the prestige of Roberto's, new taco shops in San Diego began using the \"-bertos\" suffix, with names like Alberto's, Filiberto's, Hilberto's, and others.\nThe California burrito originated at an unknown -berto's named restaurant in San Diego in the 1980s. The Fresh MXN chain (formerly Santana's) also claimed to be the originator of the California burrito. The earliest-known published mention was in a 1995 article in the \"Albuquerque Tribune\". The California burrito typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat, French fries, cheese, and either cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, onion, or guacamole (or some combination of these five). The ingredients are similar to those used in the \"carne asada fries\" dish, and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of San Diego. With the merging of French fries and more traditional burrito fillings, the California burrito is an example of fusion border food. The California burrito has also been described as a \"trans-class\" food item, as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines. Variants of this burrito may add shrimp (surf and turf), or substitute carnitas (pork) or chicken for carne asada.\n\nThe \"carne asada burrito\" is considered one of the regional foods of San Diego. Carolynn Carreno has said that to San Diegans, \"carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of (pizza) pie is to a New Yorker.\" The San Diego-style carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada, guacamole, and pico de gallo salsa. This \"wall-to-wall\" use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients.\n\nLos Angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties. The first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at Mexican-American restaurants such as Al & Bea's, Lupe's #2, and Burrito King. These restaurants have often been in existence for decades, and they offer a distinctly Americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria. The burrito of L.A. itself can take multiple forms, but is almost always dominated by some combination of: refried beans, meat (often stewed beef or chili), and cheese (usually cheddar), with rice and other ingredients typical of Mission burritos offered as add-ons, if at all.\n\nThe most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese; beyond this, there are the \"green chile\" and \"red chile\" burritos, which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans (as at Al & Bea's), or meat and/or cheese as well. Rice, again, is rarely included, which, along with the choice of chiles, is one of the style's most defining traits. The menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations, such as beef and bean, all-beef, a \"special\" with further ingredients, etc. If the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches, it may sell a burrito version of these, such as a \"hot dog burrito\".\n\nIn addition to the version described, Los Angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of Mexican fusion cuisine. The first is the famed \"kosher burrito,\" served since 1946 at its eponymous restaurant at 1st Street and Main in Downtown Los Angeles. Another is the Korean kogi burrito, invented by American chef Roy Choi, the first to combine Mexican and Korean cuisines. The kogi burrito was named the \"seventh\" best burrito in Los Angeles in 2012 by the LA Weekly. The kogi burrito is accented with chile-soy vinaigrette, sesame oil, and fresh lime juice. Food writer Cathy Chaplin has said that \"this is what Los Angeles tastes like.\" Finally, there is the sushi burrito, most notably the version sold at the \"Jogasaki\" food truck. Wrapped in flour tortillas, \"sushi burritos\" include such fillings as spicy tuna, tempura, and cucumber.\n\nThe existence of such a large truly Mexican community in Los Angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of Mexico: from Oaxaca to Hidalgo.\n\nThe breakfast burrito, a take on the American breakfast, is composed of breakfast items, particularly scrambled eggs, wrapped in a flour tortilla. This style was invented and popularized in several regional American cuisines, most notably New Mexican cuisine, Southwestern cuisine, Californian cuisine, and Tex-Mex.\n\nA wet burrito is covered with a red chili sauce similar to a red enchilada sauce, with melted shredded cheese on top. It is usually eaten from a plate using a knife and fork, rather than eaten with the hands. This variety is sometimes called \"smothered\", \"enchilada-style\", \"mojado\" (Spanish for \"wet\"), or \"suizo\" (\"Swiss\"; used in Spanish to indicate dishes topped with cheese or cream).\n\nThe Beltline Bar in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is said to have introduced the \"wet burrito\" in 1966.\n\nA burrito bowl is not technically a burrito despite its name, as it consists of burrito fillings served without the tortilla. The fillings are placed in a bowl, and a layer of rice is put at the bottom. In 2017, a Meal, Ready-to-Eat version of a burrito bowl was introduced. It is not to be confused with a taco salad, which has a foundation of lettuce inside a fried tortilla (tostada).\n\nA chimichanga is a deep-fried burrito popular in Southwestern and Tex-Mex cuisines, and in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora.\n\nTaco Bell research chef Anne Albertine experimented with grilling burritos to enhance portability. This grilling technique allowed large burritos to remain sealed without spilling their contents. This is a well-known cooking technique used by some San Francisco taquerias and Northern Mexican burrito stands. Traditionally, grilled burritos are cooked on a comal (griddle).\n\nBean burritos, which are high in protein and low in saturated fat, have been touted for their health benefits. Black bean burritos are also a good source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals.\n\n\n"}

Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from South Asia, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana, Grenada, and Jamaica. In the West Indies, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break it by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the West Indies, the term \"roti\" may refer to both the flat-bread itself as well as the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.\n\nThe \"roti wrap\" is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in Southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin and spinach as well a variety of local condiments; pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney are the most popular.\n\nThe roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean. \"Roti shops\" are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago and the wrapped roti is a staple street food. The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti. As Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. This iconic version is what most North Americans know as roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flat-bread itself that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell.\" This practice is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies.\n\nVarious types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. It is most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. West Indian style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a tawa. Certain rotis are also made with butter. Often, dal is added.\n\n"}

She cautioned that children who are susceptible to peanut-triggered anaphylaxis may not properly distinguish between Peabutter and peanut butter. Some schools have also banned Peabutter, fearing potential confusion with peanut butter.\n"}

Lettuce sandwiches have been served at fine luncheons,\nThe lettuce sandwich (bread with lettuce filling) is also an old-fashioned English food. Lettuce sandwiches are still eaten in the US and elsewhere.\n\nWhen making a bread and lettuce sandwich, the bread is sometimes buttered or spread with mayonnaise, and then lettuce is placed between the two slices of bread. \n\nTo prepare a breadless lettuce sandwich, roll any filling inside a large leaf of lettuce or place it between two leaves of lettuce.\nThe west-coast hamburger chain In-N-Out offers a lettuce sandwich variation called \"the Protein\" or \"Protein Style\" on their hidden menu. It is a hamburger patty wrapped in lettuce instead of the traditional bun.\n\nThe lettuce sandwich has also become a cultural metaphor to represent something unattractive, unappealing, weak, or mundane.\nIn this sense, the term \"limp (or soggy) lettuce sandwich\" is often used.\nBeing on a \"lettuce sandwich diet\" refers to getting by on the bare minimum with absolutely nothing more than the necessities of life.\nThe lettuce sandwich is sometimes indicative of poverty or hardship, and also represents lack of sufficient nourishment. The lettuce sandwich is considered a humble, tasteless food. It can be used to represent disappointment as in \"life need not be a lettuce sandwich over the sink\".\n\nA lettuce sandwich has been claimed to be a sleep-inducing remedy for insomnia.\nLettuce sandwiches (no bread) are also eaten to promote weight loss.\nLettuce sandwiches (bread filled with lettuce) can also be a good food choice for the health-conscious.\nThe lettuce sandwich (bread filled with lettuce)—which contains no meat—is mentioned in a book about vegetarian diets.\n\nThere has been a death attributed to eating lettuce sandwiches contaminated with the \"E. coli\" bacteria.\n\nA reference to a lettuce sandwich was made in the \"I Solemnly Swear\" episode of the \"Gilmore Girls\" TV series.\n\n"}

The product is not U.S Food and Drug Administration approved. It contains no sugar, instead providing the stimulant caffeine and the psychoactive dopamine precursor amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. According to an article in Consumer Reports, 5-hour Energy should be avoided by children under the age of 12 and as well as nursing or pregnant women.\n\nIn 2004 Manoj Bhargava's company, Living Essentials LLC, launched a product called \"5-Hour Energy\". By 2012, retail sales had grown to an estimated $1 billion.\n\nA March 2011 article in Consumer Reports reported that, according to a lab test, a 2oz 5-Hour Energy contained 207 mg of caffeine, slightly more than an 8-ounce serving of Starbucks coffee which contains 180 milligrams of caffeine. (It is not clear whether the \"Original\" or \"Extra Strength\" product was tested.) The directions on the 5-Hour bottle recommend taking half of the contents (103 mg of caffeine) for regular use, and the whole bottle for extra energy. A regular cup of coffee has less than 100 mg/250 ml cup.\n\nIn 2012, \"Forbes\" magazine commissioned an independent lab to analyze the contents within full bottles of 5-Hour Energy. The findings showed that the regular strength 5-Hour Energy contained 157 mg of caffeine, whereas the Extra Strength version had a caffeine content of 206 mg.\n\nIn December 2012, Consumer Reports published an article on 27 energy drinks including 5-hour Energy, which compared the caffeine content of the 27 drinks. Caffeine levels in 5-hour Energy are: Decaf (6 mg), Original (215 mg), and Extra Strength (242 mg). The publication also reviewed a double blind study and reported that \"5-Hour Energy will probably chase away grogginess at least as well as a cup of coffee\" and that \"little if any research\" indicated that amino acids and B vitamins would result in a difference in energy level.\n\nA lawsuit against Living Essentials was filed in 2010, alleging health hazards and deceptive labeling. The case was voluntarily dismissed in December 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the media reported that the FDA was investigating allegations that Bhargava's 5-Hour Energy product was \"potentially linked\" to the deaths of 20 of its consumers.\n\nA 2014 article in \"The New York Times\" article reported that 5-hour Energy was lobbying state attorneys general in 30 states after being investigated for deceptive advertising. A 2015 report by the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) said that the attorney general offices in five US states had filed cases against Living Essentials for \"deceptive marketing practices\" and that additional class-action lawsuits were pending in seven states.\n\nIn 2016 it won a $22 million dollar lawsuit against Stacker 2 stating that \"6-Hour Power\" was too similar to its \"5-Hour Energy\" trademark.\n\nLiving Essentials was found liable for deceptive practices under the Consumer Protection Act in Washington State in 2017. The court ordered the company to pay $4.3 million. The violations included stating that doctors recommended the product, that the product was superior to coffee, and that the decaffeinated product provided long lasting energy and alertness. The companies' communications director, Melissa Skabich, said they will appeal.\n\n\"Unlike the two other courts that found in our favor, this court did not follow the law.

It is typically a secondary sex characteristic of human males. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence, between seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until their early twenties or later. This varies, as boys may first develop facial hair between fourteen and sixteen years of age, and boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. Women are also capable of developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically significantly less than men. Men may style their facial hair into beards, moustaches, goatees or sideburns; others completely shave their facial hair. The term \"whiskers\", when used to refer to human facial hair, indicates the hair on the chin and cheeks.\n\nThe moustache forms its own stage in the development of facial hair in adolescent males. Facial hair in males does not always appear in a specific order during puberty and varies among some individuals but may follow this process:\n\nDepending on the periods and countries, facial hair was prohibited in the army or, on the contrary, an integral part of the uniform.\n\nMany religious male figures are recorded to have had facial hair; for example, all the prophets mentioned in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) were known to grow their beards. Other religions, such as Sikhism, mandate growing beards. Amish men grow beards after marriage, but continue to shave their moustaches in order to avoid historical associations with military facial hair due to their pacifistic beliefs.\n\nWomen typically have little hair on the face, apart from eyebrows and the vellus hair that covers most of the body. However, in some cases, women have noticeable facial hair growth, most commonly after menopause. Excessive hairiness (especially facially) is known as hirsutism and is usually an indication of atypical hormonal variation. In contemporary Western culture, many women depilate facial hair that appears, as considerable social stigma is associated with facial hair on women, and freak shows and circuses have historically displayed bearded women. Many women globally choose to totally remove their facial hair by professional laser treatment.\n\nGreat apes such as orangutan males seem to have facial hair as well. In chimpanzees and bonobos, facial and body hair become sparser in adulthood due to the aging process, which is in stark contrast to humans, whose facial and body hair become stronger. Because infant great apes have thicker \"facial\" (as well as body) hair than their older counterparts, it is not androgenic but part of the fur complex. The sensitivity to androgens seems to have been acquired by humans on the gene KRT37 relatively recently.\n\n\n"}

(John Glenn had consumed the fruit-flavored drink Tang in space three months earlier aboard the \"Friendship 7\".) Space food cubes were followed by other space-friendly foods created by Pillsbury's food engineers, such as non-crumbly cake, relish that could be served in slices, and meat that needed no refrigeration.\n\nIn 1970, Pillsbury filed for a trademark for a \"non-frozen balance energy snack in rod form containing nutritionally balanced amounts of carbohydrate, fat and protein\" which they dubbed \"Space Food Sticks\". No basis for use of the term \"nutritionally balanced\" was provided.\n\nA forerunner of energy bars, Space Food Sticks were promoted by Pillsbury for their association with NASA's efforts to create safe, healthy and nutritional space food. In 1972, astronauts on board Skylab 3 ate modified versions of Space Food Sticks to test their \"gastrointestinal compatibility\".\n\nCapitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions, Pillsbury marketed Space Food Sticks as a \"nutritionally balanced between meal snack\". Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box, and came in six flavors such as peanut butter, caramel, and chocolate.\n\nSpace Food Sticks disappeared from North American supermarket shelves in the 1980s.

In time, the articles began to discuss the Internet \"buzz\" itself.\n\nThe Bacon Explosion is made of bacon, sausage, barbecue sauce and barbecue seasoning or rub. The bacon is assembled in a weave to hold the sausage, sauce and crumbled bacon. Once rolled, the Bacon Explosion is cooked, basted, cut and served. The Bacon Explosion's creators produced a cookbook featuring the recipes which ultimately won the 2010 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards for \"Best Barbecue Book in the World\". The Bacon Explosion also won at the 2013 Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival.\n\nJason Day and Aaron Chronister posted the dish in December 2008 on their \"BBQ Addicts\" blog. It quickly became an Internet phenomenon, generating more than 500,000 hits and 16,000 links to the blog, and was even included on political blogs because \"Republicans like meat.\" There are fan clubs and follow-up videos of various attempts to create the dish.\n\nThe inventors are experienced barbecue competition participants from Kansas City, and compete in cook-offs as the Burnt Finger BBQ team.

Day and Chronister do not claim to have invented the concept, but assert the term \"Bacon Explosion\" as a trademark.\n\nPreparing a Bacon Explosion \"requires the minimum of culinary talent\" and the ingredient list is short. It is made from of thick cut bacon, 2 pounds of Italian sausage, one jar of barbecue sauce, and one jar of barbecue rub/seasoning. The Bacon Explosion is constructed by weaving the bacon together to serve as a base. The base is seasoned and followed by the layering of sausage meat and crumbled bacon. Barbecue sauce and more seasoning is added before rolling it into a giant \"sausage-shaped monster\" inside aluminum foil. It takes about an hour per inch of thickness to cook and is then basted with more barbecue sauce, sliced into rounds, and served.

At banquets and parties, zakuski were often served in a separate room adjacent to the dining room or on a separate table in the dining room. The tradition eventually spread to other layers of society and remained in the Soviet times, but due to lack of space, they were served on the dinner table. Zakuski became thus the first course of a festive dinner.\n\nNowadays, these appetizers are commonly served at banquets, dinners, parties and receptions in countries which were formerly part of the Russian Empire including some post-Soviet states and Poland (Polish: \"zakąski\"). A broad selection of zakuski constitutes a standard first course at any feast table. Usually, zakuski are already laid on the table when guests are called to the dining room.\n\nTypical zakuski consist of cold cuts, cured fishes, mixed salads, kholodets (meat jelly), pirogs or pirozhki, various pickled vegetables such as tomatoes, beets, cucumbers, sauerkraut, pickled mushrooms, deviled eggs, hard cheeses, caviar, canapés, open sandwiches, and breads.\n\n"}

It is typically a celebratory meal and guests can help themselves from a range of dishes laid out for their choice. In a restaurant the term refers to a buffet-style table laid out with many small dishes from which, for a fixed amount of money, one is allowed to choose as many as one wishes. In Pennsylvania, smorgasbords are popular Pennsylvania Dutch-style buffets that are often associated with Amish-made meals.\n\nIn Northern Europe, the term varies between \"cold table\" and \"buffet\": In Norway it is called \"koldtbord\" or \"kaldtbord\" and in Denmark \"det kolde bord\" (literally \"the cold table\"); in Germany \"kaltes Buffet\" (literally \"cold buffet\"); in The Netherlands \"koud buffet\" (\"cold buffet\"); in Iceland it is called \"hlaðborð\" (\"farmyard/courtyard table\"), in Estonia it is called \"külmlaud\" (\"cold table\") or \"rootsi laud\" (\"Swedish table\"), in Latvia \"aukstais galds\" (\"the cold table\"), in Finland \"voileipäpöytä\" (\"butter-bread/sandwich table\") or \"ruotsalainen seisova pöytä\" (\"Swedish standing table/buffet\"). In Eastern Europe, each language has a term that literally means \"Swedish table\". In Japan it is referred to as \"バイキング\" / \"ヴァイキング\" (\"baikingu\" / \"vaikingu\", i.e. \"Viking\").\n\nThe Swedish word \"smörgåsbord\" consists of the words \"smörgås\" (sandwich, usually open-faced) and \"bord\" (table). \"Smörgås\" in turn consists of the words \"smör\" (butter, cognate with English \"smear\") and \"gås\". \"Gås\" literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated to the surface of cream while it was churned. These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants of fat geese swimming to the surface. The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so \"smörgås\" came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term \"att breda smörgåsar\" (to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.\n\nIn English and also in Scandinavian languages, the word \"smörgåsbord\" refers loosely to any buffet with a variety of dishes — not necessarily with any connection to Swedish Christmas traditions. In an extended sense, the word is used to refer to any situation which invites patrons to select whatever they wish among lots of pleasant things, such as the smorgasbord of university courses, books in a bookstore, etc.\n\nA traditional Swedish \"smörgåsbord\" consists of both hot and cold dishes. Bread, butter, and cheese are always part of the \"smörgåsbord\". It is customary to begin with the cold fish dishes which are generally various forms of herring, salmon, and eel. After eating the first portion, people usually continue with the second course (other cold dishes), and round off with hot dishes. Dessert may or may not be included in a smörgåsbord.\n\nA special Swedish type of \"smörgåsbord\" is the \"julbord\" (literally \"Yule/Christmas table\"). The classic Swedish julbord is central to traditional Swedish cuisine, often including bread dipped in ham broth and continuing with a variety of fish (salmon, herring, whitefish and eel), baked ham, meatballs, pork ribs, head cheese, sausages, potato, Janssons frestelse, boiled potatoes, cheeses, beetroot salad, various forms of boiled cabbage, kale and rice pudding.\n\nIt is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like snaps, brännvin or akvavit with or without spices. Other traditional foods are smoked eel, rollmops, herring salad, baked herring and smoked salmon.\nOther dishes are pork sausages (\"fläskkorv\"), smoked pork and potato sausages (\"isterband\"), cabbage rolls (\"kåldolmar\"), baked beans, omelette with shrimps or mushrooms covered with béchamel sauce. Side dishes include beetroot salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown cabbage.\n\nLutfisk, lyed fish made of stockfish (dried ling or cod served with boiled potato and thick white sauce) and green peas that can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include rice pudding (\"risgrynsgröt\"), sprinkled with cinnamon powder. Traditionally, an almond is hidden in the bowl of rice porridge, and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognized for having good luck.\nJulbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until Epiphany in some homes. It is tradition for most Swedish and Norwegian workplaces to hold an annual Julbord between November and January.\n\nIn Denmark a typical tradition resembling the Swedish \"julbord\" is \"Julefrokost\" (\"Christmas-lunch\"), which involves a wellstocked Danish smörgåsbord with cold as well as hot dishes, and plenty of beer and snaps. It is distinct from the Danish Christmas dinner, which is served on December 24, and is served as a lunchtime meal, usually for family and friends on December 25 or 26. It is also a tradition for most Danish workplaces to hold an annual Julefrokost some time during the months of November to January.\n\nThe members of the Swedish merchant and upper class in sixteenth-century Sweden and Finland served schnapps table (\"brännvinsbord\"), a small buffet presented on a side table offering a variety of hors d'oeuvres served prior to a meal before sitting at the dinner table. The most simple \" brännvinsbord \" was bread, butter, cheese, herring and several types of liqueurs; but smoked salmon, sausages and cold cuts were also served. The \" brännvinsbord \" was served as an appetizer for a gathering of people and eaten while standing before a dinner or supper, often two to five hours before dinner, sometimes with the men and women in separate rooms.\nThe \"smörgåsbord\" became popular in the mid-seventeenth century, when the food moved from the side table to the main table and service began containing both warm and cold dishes. \"Smörgåsbord\" was also served as an appetizer in hotels and later at railway stations, before the dining cars time for the guests. Restaurants in Stockholm at the 1912 Olympic Games stopped serving \"smörgåsbord \" as an appetizer and started serving them instead as a main course.\n\n\n"}

It is made by layering slices of buttered bread scattered with raisins in an oven dish, over which an egg custard mixture, made with milk or cream and normally seasoned with nutmeg, vanilla or other spices, is poured. It is then baked in an oven and served.\n\n Some people may serve it with custard or cream, but often the pudding under the crust is moist enough to be eaten without sauce. It is traditional to use stale bread. Sometimes raspberry, strawberry, blackberry or mixed fruit jam, marmalade, or other sweet preserves will be spread upon the bread, along with the butter. Other modern variations include scattering fresh grapes between the layers of bread, melting apples into the egg-milk mixture, and using unusual types of breads — such as brioche — to make it. Lemon or orange peel will add a characteristic flavour.\n\nThe earliest bread and butter puddings were called \"whitepot\" and used either bone marrow or butter. Whitepots could also be made using rice instead of bread, giving rise to the rice pudding in British cuisine.\n\nOne of the earliest published recipes for a bread and butter pudding so named is found in Eliza Smith's \"The Compleat Housewife\" of 1728. She instructs \"Take a two penny loaf, and a pound of fresh butter; spread it in very thin slices, as to eat; cut them off as you spread them, and stone half a pound of raisins, and wash a pound of currants; then put puff-paste at the bottom of a dish, and lay a row of your bread and butter, and strew a handful of currants, a few raisins, and some little bits of butter, and so do till your dish is full; then boil three pints of cream and thicken it when cold with the yolks of ten eggs, a grated nutmeg, a little salt, near half a pound of sugar, and some orange flower-water; pour this in just as the pudding is going into the oven\".\n\nIn 1845, Eliza Acton suggests giving \"a good flavour of lemon-rind and bitter almonds, or of cinnamon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk\", then adding cream and sugar, thickened with beaten eggs. Her recipe also calls for a glass of brandy to be added to the mixture.\n\nIn American cuisine it may be called \"Cold Bread Pudding\".\n\nA similar dish which is popular in Egypt, made with either bread or pastry, and including pistachio nuts, and without eggs, is called \"Om Ali\".\n\n"}

{"id": "21413986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21413986", "title": "Tumpeng", "text": "Tumpeng\n\nTumpeng is a Southeast Asian cone-shaped rice dish with side dishes of vegetables and meat originating from Javanese cuisine of Indonesia. Traditionally featured in the \"slamatan\" ceremony, the rice is made by using a cone-shaped woven bamboo container. The rice itself may be plain steamed rice, uduk rice (cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (uduk rice colored with \"kunyit\" (turmeric)).\n\nThe rice cone is erected in the \"tampah\" (rounded woven bamboo container), covered with a banana leaf, and surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes. In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy promoted tumpeng as one of 30 Indonesian culinary icons and gave it the status of official national dish of Indonesia in 2014, describing it as \"the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesian various culinary traditions.\"\n\nPeople in Java, Bali and Madura usually make tumpeng to celebrate important events. However, all Indonesians are familiar with tumpeng. The philosophy of tumpeng is related to the geographical condition of Indonesia, especially Java as fertile island with numerous mountains and volcanos. Tumpeng dates back to ancient Indonesian tradition that revered mountains as the abode of \"hyangs\", the spirit of ancestors and gods. The cone-shaped rice meant to mimics the holy mountain. The feast served as a thanksgiving for the abundance of harvest or any other blessings.\n\nTumpeng is a symbol of gratitude, in gratitude ceremony (\"syukuran\" or \"slametan\"), after the people pray, the top of tumpeng is cut and delivered to the most important person. He or she may be the group leader, the oldest person, or the beloved one. Then, all people in the ceremony enjoy the tumpeng together. With tumpeng, people express the gratitude to God and appreciate togetherness and harmony. An annual ceremony involving tumpeng is commonly called 'tumpengan'.\n\nTumpengs and gunungans are an essential part in the Javanese festival sekaten, huge and large amount of tumpengs are prayed upon in the grand mosque, and then distributed to the people as part of the festivities celebrating the birth of the prophet Mohammed. \n\nIn modern times, the top of the tumpeng is given to an honoured guest in social events, ceremonies or awards. In many Indonesian cities, such as Yogyakarta, a tradition has been developed — the tumpengan ceremony the eve of 17 August — which is Indonesian independence day. The event is meant to pray for safety and welfare of the nation.\n\nThe cone shaped rice is surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes, such as \"urap\" vegetables, \"ayam goreng\" (fried chicken), \"ayam bakar\" (grilled chicken), \"empal gepuk\" (sweet and spicy fried beef), \"abon sapi\" (beef floss), \"semur\" (beef stew in sweet soy sauce), \"teri kacang\" (anchovy with peanuts), fried prawn, \"telur pindang\" (boiled marble egg), shredded omelette, \"tempe orek\" (sweet and dry fried tempeh), \"perkedel kentang\" (mashed potato fritters), \"perkedel jagung\" (corn fritters), \"sambal goreng ati\" (liver in chilli sauce), and many other things.\n\nTraditionally there should be a balance between vegetables, egg, meat, and seafood. The composition of a traditional Javanese tumpeng is more complex because the elements must balance one another according to Javanese belief. Traditional Javanese tumpeng usually involves \"urap\" vegetables, tempeh, \"ayam goreng\", \"teri kacang\", fried shrimp, \"telur pindang\", \"empal gepuk\" and \"sambal\". After the adoption of tumpeng as the national dish, tumpeng is expected to be a dish that binds Indonesia's cooking traditions. Its side dishes might be popular Indonesian dishes, such as gado-gado, satay and rendang. Today the dishes which accompany tumpeng can be of the host's discretion.\n\nThere is a philosophical meaning on every part of traditional tumpeng. According to folklore in Java and Bali, the cone-shaped tumpeng is a mystic symbol of life and ecosystems. It also symbolizes the glory of God as the Creator of nature, and the side dishes and vegetables represent the life and harmony of nature. The authentic and complete tumpeng dishes should contain at least one meat to represent a land animal, fish to represent sea creatures, an egg to represent winged beasts, and vegetables that represent a food stock provided by the plant kingdom. Usually tumpeng is served with spinach as spinach is a traditional symbol of prosperity in Javanese agricultural society.\n\nHere are the philosophical meanings behind some of the ingredients in tumpeng:\n\n\nThere are several variants of tumpeng, differentiated according to the ceremonies.\n\nToday, most Indonesians serve tumpeng as a dish to celebrate a special occasion, such as a birthday party, \"arisan\", family or neighborhood gathering, farewell party, celebrations, recitals, and many other joyous events. Because of its festive and celebration value, up until now tumpeng sometimes seen as an Indonesian counterpart of birthday cake. Tumpeng contests are sometimes held to commemorate Indonesian Independence day in August 17 or to commemorate women's emancipation day, the Kartini in April 21. The tumpengs in this contest are judged by decoration and taste.\n\nAccording to Jati in \"Local wisdom behind Tumpeng as an icon of Indonesian traditional cuisine\", in 2004, the Republic of Indonesia's Ministry of Health rolled out a tumpeng-based food pyramid to encourage healthy eating because tumpeng includes samples of food from every food group. The meat- or soy-based sides provide iron, zinc, and protein; the vegetable side dishes provide vitamins and minerals.\n\nIn 2009 Garuda Indonesia started offering \"Mini Nasi Tumpeng Nusantara\" as part of its new concept to highlight Indonesia's hospitality.\n\nTumpeng is offered in Indonesian restaurants abroad, such as in neighboring Singapore and the Netherlands.\n\nThe building of Suharto's Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, Jakarta, took shape of tumpeng.\n\n\n"}

It was said that wild boar in the Black Forest were drawn to it for its aphrodisiac qualities, hence the name \"Sauwurz\" or Hogroot. There is no scientific basis to this myth, nor any indication that Hogroot has any such effect on humans.\n\nThe hog or wild boar in the family coat-of-arms dates back to the 14th century, when Germany was made up of rival kingdoms, baronies and principalities. Hardenberg castle was built by the Electors of Mainz to defend their property in the region against feuds by neighbouring chieftains, and the knights of Hardenberg served as their Burgmanns. On one particular night, a group of warriors from Plesse Castle approached Hardenberg Castle under cover of darkness, to take the Hardenbergs by surprise. Before the invaders could take positions, a wild boar began to squeal loudly, warning the Hardenberg army in time to see off the attack and prevent a siege. From that day, a black wild boar - or Schwartz Hog - has been the family crest of the Hardenberg family, and later of their business and its products.\n"}

It was a part of the Korean royal court cuisine and was also patronized by \"yangban\" (scholarly-officials).\n\nThe Korean word (, ) is a compound consisting of (, ) meaning \"dairy\" and (, ) meaning \"porridge\".\n\nThe word is derived from the Korean transliteration of the Mongolian word () or Old Turkic . Cognates include modern Mongolian () and Kurdish , both meaning \"cheese\". As suggested by its etymology, traditional Korean \"tarak\" was heavily influenced by the customs of Central Asian—especially Mongolian— fermented milk products. Before the invention of Hangul (Korean alphabet) in the 15th century, the word was transcribed using Hanja (Chinese characters) .\n\nThe Sino-Korean word () is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\"congee\").\n\nSince the archaic word isn't readily understandable to most modern Korean speakers, the compound (, ) with the Sino-Korean word () meaning \"(cow's) milk\" is often used along with the old name. (, ) is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\"cow\") and (, ) is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\"milk\").\n\nThe history of \"tarak-juk\" dates back to the consumption of milk in Korean history. The Kingdom of Goryeo (918–1392) kept \"Yuu-so\" (dairy cow office), and nobles consumed \"nakso\" (cheese). However, dairy cattle were rare and usually milk was available only after a cow gave birth. Moreover, the freshness of milk was a vital factor as it could not be delivered over long distances. Therefore, milk was considered a supplementary food for special occasions or a recovery food after illness.\n\nDuring the Joseon era (1392–1897), the dairy cow office was relocated to a royal court ranch on Mount Naksan east of Seoul. It was renamed \"Tarak-saek\" (dairy department). Royal physicians took charge of gathering milk and making \"tarak-juk\" to present to the king. From the tenth lunar month to the first month of the next lunar year, they offered \"tarak-juk\" to the royal court. The Hall of Senior Officials also offered \"tarak-juk\" to elderly officials. Recipes for \"tarak-juk\" are recorded in the Joseon books such as \"Revised and Augmented Farm Management\" and the \"Women's Encyclopedia\".\n\nPre-soaked glutinous rice is ground by millstone, sieved, and left to settle. The deposits of ground rice, called \"muri\", are boiled, and milk is added slowly on a gentle simmer over a low flame with constant stirring. Salt is then added, to sweeten the porridge, honey can be added. The ratio between milk and \"muri\" recorded in the \"Women's Encyclopedia\" is 1:0.8, with adjustments allowed according to taste. However, the book advises the amount of \"muri\" should not exceed that of milk.\n\n"}

The jam sandwich was an affordable food which was a major part of the diets of the lower/working-class people of cities such as London and Glasgow. One plausible reason for this was that the ingredients that the jam sandwiches were made from cost little to manufacture and due to taxes being lifted on sugar in 1880, it became widely available as a cheap foodstuff. Traditionally, jam sandwiches are just jam and bread, but with the invention of the toaster oven a variety of open jam sandwich became popular now known as jam and toast.

While the drink eventually fell out of favor, it enjoyed a renewed popularity after being rediscovered by the bartender Murray Stenson in 2004 during his tenure at the Zig Zag Café and becoming a cult hit in the Seattle area.\n\nThe Last Word consists of equal amounts of gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur and freshly pressed lime juice, which are combined in a shaker with ice. After shaking, the mix is poured through a cocktail strainer (sieve) into the glass so that the cocktail contains no ice and is served \"straight up\".\n\nThe cocktail has a pale greenish color, primarily due to the Chartreuse. Audrey Saunders of the Pegu Bar in New York City considers it one of her bar's best cocktails and describes its taste as follows:\n\nThe taste may also vary slightly depending on the brand of gin being used. The original cocktail at the Detroit Athletic Club during the prohibition era used bathtub gin, and even today the club is using its own recreation of \"prohibition era bathtub gin\" (vodka, spices, herbs, citrus) for it. Some variations of the cocktail have sprung up, which usually replace the gin with another base liquor and sometimes switch the limes for lemons. A particularly well-known variation is the \"Final Ward\", created by the New York bartender Phil Ward, who replaced the gin with rye whiskey and the lime juice with lemon juice.\n\nThe first publication in which the Last Word appeared was Ted Saucier's 1951 cocktail book \"Bottoms Up!\". In it Saucier states that the cocktail was first served around 30 years earlier at the Detroit Athletic Club and later introduced in New York by Frank Fogarty. Since this dates the creation of the drink to the first years of the prohibition (1919-1933), it is usually considered a prohibition era drink. A research in the archives of the Detroit Athletic Club by John Frizell revealed later that the drink was slightly older predating the prohibition era by a few years. It was already offered on the club's 1916 menu for a price of 35 cents making it the club's most expensive cocktail at the time.\n\nFogarty himself was no bartender but one of the best known vaudevillian monologists (roughly comparable to today's stand-up comedians) of his time. Some assume that this occupation gave rise to the cocktail's name. Nicknamed the \"Dublin minstrel\" Fogarty often opened his performance with a song and ended it with a serious heartthrob recitation. In 1912 he won the New York Morning Telegraph contest for the best vaudeville artist and in 1914 he was elected president of \"The White Rats\" (vaudeville actors union). Around the time the cocktail was presumably created, Fogarty performed at the Temple theater in Detroit.\n\nThe cocktail however fell into oblivion sometime after World War II until it was rediscovered by Murray Stenson in 2004. Stenson was looking for a new cocktail for the Zig Zag Cafe in Seattle, when he came across an old 1952 copy of Saucier's book. Soon after being offered at the Zig Zag Cafe it became somewhat of cult hit in the Seattle and Portland areas and spread to cocktail bars in major cities worldwide. It also spawned several variations with \"The Final Ward\" probably being the best known among them. In addition its recipe reappeared in newer cocktail guides including the 2009 edition of the Mr. Boston Official Bartender's Guide.\n\nOn May 20, 2011 Rachel Maddow demonstrated the preparation of the cocktail in her show on MSNBC and called it the \"last word for the end of the world\".

The short ribs, or \"\"galbi\"\" also refers to grilled short ribs in Korean barbecue while the suffix \"tang\" is another name for \"guk\". Hence, the Korean name literally means \"short ribs soup\" and is also called \"garitang\", or \"galitang\". The clear and hearty soup is made by slowly simmering \"galbi\" in water for a long time and is eaten as a meal. It is similar to \"seolleongtang\", a soup made from the bones of ox legs.\n\nHistorical records on \"galbitang\" are found in records on table setting for Korean royal court banquets held in the 1890s. However, \"galbi\" was assumed to have been eaten since the end of the Goryeo Dynasty (918 – 1392).\n\n\"Galbitang\" has been a representative dish served at wedding receptions.\n\nAbout five hours are needed to cook the whole dish. Slits are made in the top of the inner bones with a sharp knife before the ribs are cut to make the flesh separate easily from the prepared beef rib. The ribs are chopped into pieces of 5-6 cm in length, and a whole radish is inserted into a pot with water over a high heat at first. As time goes by, the heat is lowered to a medium temperature. Once the beef becomes soft after being simmered for about four to five hours, the radish is taken out of the pot. It is flatly sliced into a 3 cm length. The ribs are also taken out of the pot and seasoned with minced scallions, garlic, and pepper powder, sesame oil, a mixture of sesame and salt, and soy sauce. As the soup is chilled, fat floating on the surface is removed. The seasoned ribs and sliced radish are again put into the pot and are simmered one more time.\n\n\n"}

Almost every substantial dish in medieval Arab cuisine used murrī in small quantities. It could be used as a substitute for salt or sumac, and has been compared to soy sauce by Rudolf Grewe, Charles Perry, and others due to its high monosodium glutamate content and resultant umami flavor.\n\nOriginally a Byzantine condiment, murrī made its way into medieval Arab cookbooks, likely due to exposure to Byzantine culture during the empire's rule over much of what came to be the Arab world. Charles Perry, an expert in medieval Arab cuisine, suggests that murrī arose from garum, a fermented fish brine that was commonly used by the Greeks and Romans. As Arab lexicographers have noted that murrī is pronounced \"al-muri\", with one \"r\", and suspect it is a word of non-Arab origin, Perry suggests that its etymology may be connected to the Greek \"halmuris\", medieval Greek \"almuris\", the source of the Latin \"salmuria\", meaning \"brine\".\n\nThe recipe for murrī was mistranscribed with the fermenting stage omitted, in a 13th-century text \"Liber de Ferculis et Condimenti\", where it was described as \"salty water\" elsewhere in the translation.\n\nTraditionally, murrī production was undertaken annually in households at the end of March and continued over a period of 90 days. Barley-based murrī entails the wrapping of raw barley dough in fig leaves which are left to sit for 40 days. The dough is then ground and mixed with water, salt, and usually additional flour. It is then left to ferment for another 40 days in a warm place. The resulting dark mahoghany brown paste, mixed with water to form a liquid, is murrī.\n\nA fast method for preparing murrī is to mix 2 parts barley flour to one part salt and make a loaf that is baked in the oven until hard and then pounded into crumbs to soak in water for a day and a night. This mixture, known as the first murri, is then strained and set aside. Then, raisins, carob, dill, fennel, nigella, sesame, anis, mace, citron leaf, and pine seed milk are boiled with water and strained. The second murri is then added to the first, and boiled until thickened.\n\nMurrī mixed with milk was known as \"kamakh\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22064236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22064236", "title": "Donkey milk", "text": "Donkey milk\n\nDonkey milk (or ass milk/jenny milk) is the milk given by the domesticated donkey \"(Equus asinus)\". It has been used since antiquity for cosmetic purposes as well as infant nutrition.\n\nThe use of donkey milk by humans for alimentary and cosmetic purposes has been popular since Egyptian antiquity.\n\nHippocrates (460 – 370 BC), the father of medicine, was the first to write of the medicinal virtues of donkey milk. In the Roman era donkey milk was recognized as a common remedy, Pliny the Elder (23 – 79 AD) in his encyclopedic work, \"Naturalis Historia\", wrote extensively about its health benefits, but it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the first real scientific consideration was given to donkey milk. Subsequently, the famous French naturalist, Georges-Louis Leclerc (1707–1788) mentions the benefits of donkey milk in his \"Histoire naturelle\" and Pauline Bonaparte (1780–1825), Napoleon’s sister, is also reported to have used Donkey milk for her skin’s health care. In France in the nineteenth century, Dr. Parrot of Hospital des Enfants Assistès spread the practice of bringing babies motherless directly to the donkey’s nipple (Bullettin de l’Académie de médicine, 1882). The donkey’s milk was then sold until the twentieth century to feed orphaned infants and to cure delicate children, the sick and the elderly. For this reason, in Italy, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland many donkeys are born on farms.\n\nThe asinine species is considered a seasonal polyestrous one, but the latitude in which the farm is located can greatly influence the reproduction cycle. The female is normally pregnant for about 12 months.\n\nDonkey milk production differs greatly from that of conventional dairy species, especially in terms of milk supply which is much more limited. The equid mammary gland has a low capacity (max 2,5 L) and a part of the milk production should be left to the foal and that milking may be carried out two or three hours after separation from the foal. Donkeys should be milked from 20 to 90 d after foaling for three times a day. A female gives between 0.5 and 1.3 litres of milk a day for about 6–7 months. . The variability of donkey milk production is due to many factors, such as individual milkability, nutrition, genetics, management of reproduction, etc., in addition to milking management.\n\nGenerally, a donkey farm (breeding), aimed at milk’s production are small, with some tens of heads and rarely more. In Europe and specifically in Emilia Romagna (Italy) there is only one very great asinine farm with 800 head.\n\nPublished data on donkey milk gross composition confirm the closer resemblance to breast milk for lactose, protein and ash levels when compared with cow, sheep and goat milk. Despite the high lactose content of donkey milk the average fat content is lower for this purpose, when used in infant nutrition, donkey milk is usually supplemented with vegetal oil (4 mL 100 mL milk) to conform to human milk energy\n\nThe casein to whey protein ratio in donkey milk was lower compared to the value on cow milk.\n\nThe non-protein nitrogen (NPN) accounts for an average of 16% of total nitrogen in donkey milk, is much closer than values reported for human milk (20%) but higher than those of domestic ruminants (5%).\n\nThe amino acid profile of the donkey milk proteins shows a very similar percentage of essential amino acids (36.7 e 38.2 g amino acid /100 g protein) than in human milk proteins (40.7 g amino acid /100 g protein), according to Guo et al.\n\nAmong the functional proteins detected in donkey milk, there are molecules active in antimicrobial protection such as lysozyme and lactoferrin. The lactoferrin content of donkey milk is intermediate between the lower values of cow milk and the higher values of human milk. Lactoferrin inhibits the growth of iron-dependent bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. This inhibits certain organisms, such as coliforms and yeast, that require iron. Lysozyme in donkey milk is present in large amounts, indeed ranges from 1.0 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL, depending on the analytical method used (chemical or microbiological); this substance is present also in human (0.12 mg/ml) but only in trace amounts in cow and goat milk. Lysozyme in donkey milk is highly thermo-stable and is very resistant to acid and protease and may play a significant role in the intestinal immune response.\n\nIn donkey mammary secretion, defatted or not, growth factors and hormones have also been determined. In detail, donkey mammary secretions contain human-like leptin at levels close to human milk (3.35 e 5.32 ng/mL milk). The bioactive peptides insulin like growth factor 1, ghrelin and triiodothyronine were also found in frozen donkey milk. These molecules, and many others present in human milk, are increasingly receiving attention from a nutraceutical point of view because of their potential direct role in regulating food intake, metabolism, and infant body condition.\n\nDonkey milk is used as a natural hypoallergenic milk, because it is tolerated by about 90% of infants with food allergies, e.g., breast’ milk protein allergy (BMPA), a common food allergy in childhood with a prevalence of approximately 3% during the first 3 years of life. However the infants tolerance of donkey juice must be evaluated first subjectively, under medical supervision and after carrying out specific allergy tests. Use of donkey's milk on infants under six months is inadvisable as this has been linked to cases of infant death and lowered immunity due to infection and the decreased ability of the infant to take up colostrum.\n\nDonkey's milk is similar of human juice for its lactose, proteins, minerals, and omega-69 fatty amino-acid content.\n\nIn terms of energy despite the high lactose content of donkey milk the average fat content is lower. When used in infant nutrition, donkey milk is usually supplemented with vegetable oil (4 mL per 1 mL milk) to mimic breast milk hyper energy. Donkey milk contains immune-enhancing compounds (in particular lysozyme and lactoferrin) to help protect infants from infection and disease (although this is often debated with many saying that donkey milk may not even exist). In addition, the flavour and appearance of donkey milk have been found to be attractive to children.\n\nEquid (donkey and horse) milk can be considered a suitable substrate for probiotic beverage production.\n\nThe use of fermented equid milk is an ancient tradition in central Asia, like koumiss or airag, a fermented mares milk very popular in Asia and Russia; but there are also traditional variants made from donkey milk.\n\nIn Mongolia, where koumiss is the national drink, people have a saying that ‘kumys cures 40 diseases’.\n\nIt is said that Cleopatra, Queen of Ancient Egypt, took baths in donkey milk to preserve the beauty and youth of her skin. Legend has it that no less than 700 donkeys were needed to provide the quantity of milk necessary for her daily bath.\n\nThis was also the case of Poppaea Sabina (30 – 65), second wife of Roman Emperor Nero, who is referred to in Pliny’s description of the ass milk virtues for the skin:\n\n\"\"It is generally believed that ass milk effaces wrinkles in the face, renders the skin more delicate, and preserves its whiteness : and it is a well-known fact, that some women are in the habit of washing their face with it seven times daily, strictly observing that number. Poppaea, the wife of the Emperor Nero, was the first to practise this; indeed, she had sitting-baths, prepared solely with ass milk, for which purpose whole troops of she- asses used to attend her on her journeys \"\"\n\nThe Roman poet Ovid.(43 BC. – 18 d.C.) also in his poem \"Medicamina Faciei Femineae\", suggest beauty masks made with donkey milk.\n\nPauline Bonaparte (1780–1825), Napoleon’s sister, is also reported to have used ass milk for her skin’s health care.\n\nIn recent years, the cosmetic industry is mainly focused towards products made with natural ingredients and it is oriented to a sustainable consumption. Because of their natural origin, milk components correspond in many fields to the needs of cosmetology.\n\nRecent scientific study on a cream containing of lyophilized donkey milk showed different benefits for the skin. These results are related to the effectiveness of donkey milk components like proteins, minerals, vitamins, essential fatty acids, bioactive enzyme and coenzyme which allow the skin a balanced nourishment and a proper hydration. In particular vitamin C content in donkey milk is almost 4 times more of cow's milk. Donkey milk contain more lactoferrin of cow milk and a considerable mounts of lysozyme, from 1.0 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL (depending on the analytical method used: chemical or microbiological), instead cow's milk only traces. For this reason have the potentiality, when properly formulated, to reduce problem skin with eczema, acne, psoriasis and herpes and properties in calming the irritation symptoms as reported by some authors.\n\nSome authors have preliminarily evaluated whether the use of a face cream made from donkey milk affected the perception of some sensory aspects. The results showed that treated cream resulted appreciated by dry skin consumers for the following sensory aspects: spreadability, total appearance, smoothness, moisturisation and total effectiveness . The overall judgement also resulted highest for face cream made with donkey milk\n\nToday, donkey milk is still used in the manufacture of soaps and creams with donkey's milk.\n\n\nThis product is made to safeguard the highest biological quality of donkey milk, so to preserve its nutritional, functional and cosmetic properties. This is possible because with freeze-dried the milk is frozen and brought under vacuum at low temperatures. During this process the water is removed by sublimation. The result is approximately ten percent of solid substance what is called donkey milk lyophilized (or freeze dried). It is in powder form easy to reconstitute. The lyophilized product has to be packaged without any oxygen. The durability of donkey milk lyophilized can take 2 year.\n\nConcluding, the treatment of lyophilization (freeze dried) of donkey’s milk demonstrated that the natural colour, flavours, nutrients, bioactive substances of the fresh donkey milk are retained. Instead, with the spray-drying method, another way to dry products, the milk is being heated whereby vitamins and other important bioactive substances will get lost. In addition Freeze-dried don't require chemical preservatives and can be either consumed directly or re hydrated easily. However, this method for its high costs is practiced only by a few companies.\n\nThis product it is easy to find in Italy, where it was for the first time put on the market, but can be difficult outside of Europe.\n"}

Although considered as a traditional Sri Lankan dish, it is believed to have come from the Dutch. This is an important dish when celebrating Sinhala and Tamil New Year and plays a major role in the festivities.\n\nAlthough kokis is considered as a traditional Sri Lankan dish, it is believed to be of Dutch origin, from the time when parts of the country were under Dutch rule during the mid-17th century to the late 18th century. Its name may have been derived from the word \"\", meaning cookies or biscuits in the Dutch language. The Swedish Rosette (cookie) & Persian Nan panjereh would be the most identical dishes for Sri Lankan Kokis. An almost identical snack named Achappam exists among Christian community in the south west Indian state of Kerala\n\nSinhalese people prepare and consume a number of traditional dishes, including kokis, to celebrate their new year in mid-April. These are traditionally prepared by the women of the household, usually a few days before the new year. Nowadays however, they are made mostly by older women, as many people of the younger generation lack the time or the skill and knowledge required to make them due to their busy lifestyles.\n\nA special mold of decorative shape such as a flower is used to make kokis. This is called a \"kokis achchuwa\" (). It is also called Rosette cookies in English. This mold is coated in a thick batter made from rice flour, coconut milk and beaten eggs. Sugar and salt may be added to the mixture as well. The batter-covered mold is dipped in boiling coconut oil, and the kokis is shaken off the mold and into the oil when it is half cooked and allowed to deep fry until ready. The cooked dish is crispy, and may be served hot or after cooling down. The oil is usually drained on paper before serving. It may also be prepared using wheat flour, as an alternative to the traditional rice flour.\n\nKokis may be consumed as a dessert, and also as an appetizer or snack. It is also commonly served with kiribath and other traditional sweets, which are collectively referred to as sweetmeats or \"rasa kavili\" (), particularly at new year celebrations and other auspicious occasions.\n\nLike most of the traditional Sri Lankan sweetmeats, kokis is a food that has a high energy-density. As an oily and fatty food, there is a risk of it causing heart diseases and narrowing of blood vessels.\n\n"}

The name comes from the Spanish word \"\"puchero\"\" which means \"stewpot\".\n\nThe dish is essentially equivalent to the \"cocido\" of Spain but lacking colorants (such as paprika), using local ingredients which vary from one region to another. In Spain chickpeas are widely used. A dish similar to puchero called sancocho is consumed in Colombia, Ecuador, República Dominicana, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Andalusia, \"puchero\" was originally a peasant soup. The basic ingredients of the broth are meat (beef, veal, pork and/or chicken), bacon, cured bones (such as those of the jamón serrano), and vegetables (potatoes, celery, chard, leek, carrots, and turnips). It can be drunk straight in mugs as a consommé known as \"caldo de puchero\", which can be seasoned with fresh spearmint leaves or sherry. Alternatively, it can be prepared as a soup after adding chickpeas, cured ham, boiled egg, and rice, noodles or bread. The meat left-overs, called \"pringá\", is usually served separately as a main dish, and the remnants used for subsequent dishes as croquettes or \"ropa vieja\".\n\nPuchero is eaten in the parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay that border the Río de la Plata. The dish is prepared quite similarly as in Spain, though its ingredients are significantly different due to the vastly different local produce. In the parts of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay surrounding the estuary of the Río de la Plata, puchero is primarily beef-based, as beef was plentiful and cheap, and chickpeas are less common there than in the Iberian peninsula.\n\nThe cuts of meat used are particularly important: if possible, \"ossobuco\"; otherwise beef cuts with marrow or poultry (used in \"puchero de gallina\") can be substituted. Other ingredients used may include potatoes, onions, and squash. Some local variations call for the addition of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, carrots, bacon, sliced chorizo, pork belly, cabbage, and eggs.\n\nPuchero is considered a lower- and middle class staple, and is traditionally served during the fall and winter. It can be found on menus in family and regional restaurants throughout Argentina, but not at most more expensive restaurants.\n\nIn Filipino cuisine, puchero (Tagalog: \"putsero\") refers to a dish composed of beef chunks stewed with \"saba\" bananas (or plantains). The dish may also include potatoes or sweet potatoes, \"chorizos de Bilbao\", \"bok choy\", leeks, chickpeas, cabbage and tomato sauce. Other versions replace beef with chicken or pork.\n\nThe Yucatec puchero varies by cook and region. The most complete version is called puchero de tres carnes -- \"with three meats\", pork, beef and chicken. This could actually be a great vegetarian dish if made without the meat as the other ingredients include: a piece of plantain in skin, onion, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, squash /calabaza, turnips (when and where available), white cabbage /repollo and typically a type of pasta soup (noodles/fideos) and rice to increase the heartiness and especially if only one or two meats are used. The soup like the 98% of Yucatec soups-stews are broth consommés, not at all thick or heavy. It is flavored with saffron, allspice and black pepper. The dish is served with all ingredientts in the bowl and a side of fresh additions. Typically or traditionally, a side plate is provided so that the person can put the meat to the side while eating the soup. The garnish consists of freshly chopped or diced habanero, onion, radish and cilantro. Avocados when in season. See Steffan Igor Ayora Diaz book on the anthropology of Yucatán food \n\n"}

Outside the Netherlands, the word \"grachten\" mostly refer to the city canals of Amsterdam, for which it is well known.\n\nThe word \"gracht\" cannot be easily translated; for this reason, it is necessary to distinguish between four related terms:\n\n\nAlthough the word \"gracht\" means \"canal\" or \"waterway\" in the general sense, there is no exact equivalent for the term in English.\n\nThe word \"gracht\" stems from the older word \"graft\", which is derived from \"graven\", to dig. The Dutch language has had a sound shift in which the combination -ft became -cht. Other good examples are \"lucht\" (German: \"Luft\", air) and \"zacht\" (English: soft). In some regional languages such as Frisian and Gronings, the word \"graft\" is still used.\n\nIn Dutch, the word \"gracht\" is used only when canals are located inside the city, while canals outside a city are called \"kanaal\". However, Venice is an exception. In Dutch, one does not say \"\"de grachten van Venetië\"\" (the city-canals of Venice), but \"\"de kanalen van Venetië\"\" (the canals of Venice).\n\nToponyms for grachten are usually made by the suffixes \"-gracht\", \"-singel\" (which refers to the old circle-shaped canals), \"-wal\" (referring to the bank of the gracht), \"-vest\" (referring to a fortification), and \"-kade\" (Flemish: \"-kaai\"; quay). The suffix \"-diep\" is used in Groningen where it is a local word for a large canal.\n\nWhen a \"gracht\" is a remake of an old river, the river's name is used.\n\n\"Grachten\" were the life-lines of Dutch and Flemish cities. They were used for many purposes: for transportation, for draining, as water supply and as sewers, all at the same time. In heavily populated cities, these combined functions repeatedly proved to be detrimental to the public health. \n\nMost Hanseatic cities have \"grachten\" to transport, to load and to land goods in and from ships. In the Netherlands, the northeastern cities of Deventer, Hindeloopen, Kampen, Leeuwarden, Meppel, Sneek, Zutphen and Zwolle are renowned for their historical \"grachten\". Other cities in the Netherlands, in the western part of the country, are also touristic attractions because of their \"grachten\", especially Alkmaar, Amersfoort, Gouda, Hoorn, Leiden, Utrecht and Weesp.\n\nSometimes \"grachten\" were made from older rivers, like in Groningen. There the older river called Drentse Aa was used as a natural part of the grachten. In Delft, the main \"gracht\" – Oude Delft – started as a drainage canal for reclaiming land in marshy surroundings: in a period roughly around the year 1100, a canal was dug, making use of a natural creek in the marshy country. This canal was called \"Delf\", later on \"Delft\", from the word \"delven\" that is akin to the verb to \"delve\" in English. This canal was used to drain the land at both sides; later on it also served as a waterway for transport.\n\nLater, a second canal, called the \"Nieuwe Delft\" (New Delft) was dug through part of the settlement that had grown around the first. The original canal became known as the \"Oude Delft\" (Old Delft), a name it still bears today.\n\nThe rural village around \"Oude\" and \"Nieuwe Delft\" developed into a more urban area and the canals gradually acquired the character of city-canals or \"grachten\". A third canal was dug and also changed into a \"gracht\"; it connected with the moat around the marketplace. The city and the \"grachten\" grew hand in hand. In 1246, this agglomeration was granted a city charter by the Count of Holland and became the City of Delft. A natural waterway was later incorporated in the city and became a \"gracht\" as well. Circular canals or \"singels\" were dug and surrounded the city. Fortifications were built along these \"singels\" and fixed the shape of the historical inner city of Delft. The characteristic, narrow \"grachten\", perpendicular to the main \"grachten\", developed from ditches that had been dug to drain and delimit the fields which preceded the city.\n\nWhen it was still a Dutch colony, Cape Town had a network of \"grachten\", that were fed by the springs at the base of Table Mountain. These provided water and sanitation for the infant town. In the ensuing centuries, the \"grachten\" were covered over, but many of the prominent streets in the modern city centre still bear their names (notably the Heerengracht, Keizersgracht, Buitengracht and Buitensingel). There is currently a project to restore some of these historic waterways.\n\nA function in almost every city was drainage. Rainwater flowed through these city-canals. Usually they were also used as a sewer. Because these functions are not needed any more, many \"grachten\" have been filled in to give access to road traffic. However, these new streets have mostly retained the names of the \"grachts\" and \"singels\" they covered or replaced.\n"}

In Mexico it is usually sold by street vendors in small plastic cups or in plastic bags tied around a straw. In the United States it can be found in Mexican juice bars.\n\nThe exact origin of Tejuino is disputed, however most Mexicans agree that the drink dates back to pre-Columbian times.

The celebration includes decorating Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, and gift exchanges.\n\nAccording to the local legend, in the early part of the 20th century a freak blizzard stranded visitors and their stagecoach at the Old Faithful Inn. Rather than lament the fact that they were snowbound in a hotel, the guests decided to celebrate Christmas, since it looked like Christmas outside. Some stories place this blizzard as happening \"shortly after the turn of the [20th] century\" while others specify the blizzard occurred in 1939 and some place it in the 1920s.\n\nSome stories date the blizzard to the 19th century, prior to the creation of the Old Faithful Inn. There is no historical record recording that a blizzard ever hit Yellowstone on or around August 25 of any given year. In fact, between 1904 and 1941, the most snow that Yellowstone received on any given day in August was 1.8 inches on August 18, 1932. Interviews with older employees indicate that the celebration was not held prior to the 1930s.\n\nWhile the actual origins to the Christmas in August story are unknown, Yellowstone's Information Specialist Leslie Quinn speculates that the origins are based upon three factors. First, during the 1930s the celebration of Christmas in July was a popular celebration in the Rocky Mountains. Second, August 25th is the anniversary of the National Park Service. Third, there was an existing celebration in the park known as \"Savage Days.\" Quinn discovered a 1966 article published by the Park's Recreation department titled, \"\"Christmas Comes Twice a Year—Once At Home and Once Up Here.\" In the article, Gene \"Mr. Yellowstone Music\" Quaw, indicated that there was no Christmas in August celebration while he worked in Yellowstone during the 1920s and 1930s. According to Quaw, there was a small Christmas in July celebration and that the employees would have an employee-only celebration called \"Savage Days\" wherein a park employee would dress as Santa Claus.\n\nIn 1977, park historian Aubrey L. Haines, indicated that the earliest reference in the 1947 employee handbooks was an indication that read \"O. F. Savages held annual celebration, 7/25.\" According to the August 1, 1947 issue of \"Yellowstone's Weekly News\" the July 25th celebration had nothing to do with Christmas. \"The 'savages' (concessionaire employees) at Old Faithful held a gala affair on July 25 known as \"Savage Day.\" Several floats were entered in the long parade up the main street at Old Faithful. The day concluded with a large masquerade ball in the evening.\" Haines indicates that he remembered the celebrations going back to 1939 when he worked at Old Faithful as an Assistant District Ranger, but that nobody paid the employee-only celebration much attention.\n\nBy 1953, however, the annual celebration known as \"savage days\" had become a parkwide celebration and had attracted the attention of the park concessioners and National Park Service as it interfered with service quality.\n\n1953 was the last year \"Savage Days\" were celebrated in Yellowstone National Park. Starting in 1954, the park concessionaires made a concerted effort to merge Savage Days with the smaller \"Christmas in July\" celebration. Trevor Povah, the head of Hamilton Stores, one of the park concessioners claims that the park concessioners deliberately created the story of a blizzard at the Old Faithful Inn to obfuscate the origins of a new celebration called \"Savage Christmas.\" In 1955, the first publications came out mentioning \"Savage Christmas.\" From 1954–59, the celebration was held either on July 25 or August 25, but by 1959 August 25 became the permanent date. Quinn speculates that there were two reasons why the August 25th date prevailed over the July 25th one. First, the tourist season in Yellowstone starts in May and ends at the end of August, by celebrating Christmas on August 25th, it became an end of the tourist season celebration. Second, Warren Ost, a bellhop at the Old Faithful Inn and founder of A Christian Ministry in the National Parks (ACMNP), had started a choir. The choir held its first celebration on August 7, 1949. Within two years, ACMNP was forming choirs at the Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and Lake areas of the park with the intention of performing Handel's Messiah. Quinn reasons that having the Messiah, which was an annual tradition from the early 1950s through the 1990s, coincide with the Christmas celebration would have been a logical step. \"But with only a short season in which to prepare, an August date for the concert\nwould have been more reasonable, and this may have been a factor in the July-to- August switch.\" Delmar J. Sicard, III, the author who wrote the article \"Christmas Comes Twice A Year—Once At Home And Once Up Here\" noted that the Christmas celebrations \"began to take on a more serious and formal aspect\" with the arrival of ACMNP serminarians.\n"}

The reaction was first described by Wolfgang Steglich in 1978. It is an adaptation of an older method for the formation of amides by means of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT).\n\nThis reaction generally takes place at room temperature. A suitable solvent is dichloromethane. Because the reaction is mild, esters can be obtained that are inaccessible through other methods for instance esters of the sensitive 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. A characteristic is the formal uptake of water generated in the reaction by DCC, forming the urea compound dicyclohexylurea (DCU).\n\nThe reaction mechanism is described as follows:\n\nWith amines, the reaction proceeds without problems to the corresponding amides because amines are more nucleophilic. If the esterification is slow, a side-reaction occurs, diminishing the final yield or complicating purification of the product. This side-reaction is a 1,3-rearrangement of the \"O\"-acyl intermediate to an \"N\"-acylurea which is unable to further react with the alcohol. DMAP suppresses this side reaction, acting as an acyl transfer-reagent in the following manner:\n\n\n"}

It was launched in mid-seventies but started gaining popularity in the eighties when the market was dominated by carbonated soft drinks like Thums up, Gold Spot and Limca. As of 2009, Rasna had a 93% market share in the soft drink concentrate market in India and as of 2011, the company had a turnover of .\n\nThough the company does most of its business in India where it has 5 manufacturing facilities in Gujarat and 1 in Himachal Pradesh, it has manufacturing facilities outside India in Bangladesh, Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well. The company manufactures soft drink concentrate in 11 different flavours. In India, Rasna earns most of its profits from the soft drink concentrate market though it makes fruit jams, fruit cordials, teas, pickles, chutneys, ready-to-eat curries and snacks, majority of which are exported.\n\nIn 2000, Rasna launched an aerated fruit drink, Oranjolt. The venture failed, which was attributed to the fact that the drink needed to be refrigerated at all times and many retailers in India switch off their refrigerators at night. The company launched juice products in the market in 2002 and in 2010, it announced that it was entering the health drinks segment.\n\nThe company has used national television as a mode of advertising its products since the 1980s. Its tagline \"I love you Rasna\" is aimed at children. In the original ad campaign, the Rasna girl was played by \"Ankita Jhaveri\", now an actress in South India while the latest one, \"Avan Khambatta\" is from the \"Khambatta\" family which owns the company. Rasna's distribution was initially taken up by Voltas and after two years of handling, Khambhatta decided to withdraw and approached Rallis and Corn products (now known as Bestfoods and owned by Unilever). However, since that did not materialise, Pioma Industries set up its own distribution infrastructure. Their brand advertising was managed by Mudra Communications between 1984 and 2005, Dentsu between 2005 and 2009 and from 2009 onwards by Rediffusion. In the past, Karisma Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Anupam Kher, Paresh Rawal, Kapil Dev, Virender Sehwag and Genelia D'Souza have been Rasna's brand ambassadors. Currently, Rasna's brand ambassador is Akshay Kumar. As part as a promotional campaign featuring then Miss India, Pooja Chopra, Rasna made an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the \"world's biggest glass\" in 2009.\n\nKraft Foods, which markets soft drink concentrate under the Tang brand internationally, entered India in 2001 by setting up a manufacturing facility in Hyderabad. By 2003, tough competition from Rasna among other brands forced Kraft to shut its plant in India. At the time Rasna was said to be interested in purchasing the plant. However, the plant was not sold and restarted manufacturing Tang when it was taken over by Cadburys in 2010 as part of its global buyout by Kraft Foods. Rasna made another attempt at acquisition in 2003 itself, when it attempted to buy \"Brown & Polson\" and \"Rex Jelly\" brands from Hindustan Lever. According to \"Piruz Khambatta\", Chairman and managing director of Rasna, the deal offered was a licensing deal rather than an outright buyout, hence it fell through. India was the first market where Coca-Cola launched its soft drink concentrate brand, Sunfill. This brand too did not do well and was withdrawn in 2004, failing to break Rasna's monopoly in the segment. Like Tang, Sunfill too has been recently relaunched in India, in 2011.\n\n"}

It consists of a blouse (襦, \"ru\") and a wrap-around skirt (裙, \"qun; \"also called \"裳, chang\"). It is the eldest type of hanfu which is said to have been worn by the legendary Yellow Emperor, and it is said to be worn by women since the Warring States period.\n\nRuqun is the most basic type of Hanfu.Ruqun is divided into Qiyao ruqun, Gaoyao ruqun and Qixiong ruqun based on the waist height of the skirt. The collar style can be divided into Jiaoling ruqun and duijin ruqun. It is said to be the basic clothing up to the 3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors age. At that time, it was worn by both men and women.\n\nGenerally the blouse was tucked into the skirt. The popularity of \"ruqun\" declined during the Han Dynasty. Although the popularity of women wearing \"ruqun\" increased again during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, most men did not wear it any more. In the Wei Dynasty and Jin Dynasty \"ruqun\" went through a major change when women started to wear much longer upper garments which needed to be put out of the skirt. This new style of ruqun was called \"shanqun (衫裙)\" and existed with \"ruqun.\" During the Sui and Tang Dynasty, the skirts were tied higher and higher up the waist, until they were eventually tied above the breasts, worn with short blouses. In addition to the normal crossed-collar blouses, parallel/straight-collar (對襟) blouses were also worn in this period, thus exposing the cleavage of the breasts. During the Song Dynasty, the skirts were eventually lowered from the breast level back to the normal waistline. In the early Ming Dynasty, \"ruqun\"'s variant, \"shanqun\", went through a major change when women stopped using the sash. This new style of \"ruqun\", also called \"aoqun\" (襖裙), became popular in the late Ming Dynasty.\n\nBy the Ming Dynasty, \"ruqun\" became the most common form of attire for women. The sleeves of the blouse are mostly curved with a narrow sleeve cuff (琵琶袖, \"pipa\" sleeve). The collar is of the same colour as the clothing. Often, there is an optional detachable protective \"huling\" (護領, lit. \"protect collar\") sewn to the collar. The \"huling\" can be white or any dark colour, and is used to protect the collar from being rotten by sweat, therefore to extend the life of the clothing. Towards the start of the Qing Dynasty, the skirt was mostly \"baizhequn\" (百摺裙, lit. \"hundred pleats skirt\") or \"mamianqun\" (馬面裙, lit. \"horse face skirt\").\n\n"}

The dish has a strong, decisive flavour, and was a favourite of conductor Arturo Toscanini. One writer describes it as a \"noble, ancient Milanese dish\", and writes of the inexpressible \"pleasure that it furnishes the soul as well as the palate, especially on a wintry day\".\n\nOne account of the origins of the dish associates it with the January 17 celebration of St Anthony the Abbot which coincided with the end of the pig slaughtering season. The parts of the pig used for the dish were those ready for consumption immediately after slaughter, whereas the better cuts of meat would be hung to improve the flavour.\n\nAnother account traces the origins of the dish to the 16th century when Spain ruled Milan; it tells how a Spanish army officer taught the recipe to his lover, who cooked for a noble Milanese family, and the dish was well received and became popular.\n\nThe meat used in the dish includes mainly pork meat (usually least valuable parts like ribs, rind, head, trotters, ears, nose and tail), Verzino sausage, and sometimes other meats like chicken and goose. These are cooked in a casserole (whence its name) with ingredients such as onion, carrot, celery and black pepper for about two and a half hours, after which the cabbage is added and cooking continues for a further half-hour.\n\nUsually, \"cassoeula\" is served with polenta and/or a strong red wine.

Many of the dances stem from traditions or historical events, but also include ballroom and ballet style elements. Nowadays, they are typically danced by small companies on major holidays and events.\n\nPolish folk dances (singular: \"taniec ludowy\", ; plural: \"tańce ludowe\" ) tend to be lively, energetic, and joyful. Hops, twirls, and athletic movements are common. Many dances involve a circle (Polish: \"koło\" \"circle\", \"kołem\" \"in a circle\") but also partners.\n\n\nThe Polish national dances are the Krakowiak, Kujawiak, Mazurek, Oberek, and Polonaise. These dances are classified as National, because almost every region in Poland has displayed a variety of these dances. Many of these dances were brought to the ballroom floor following Napoleon's expansion into Eastern Europe, which brought French nobility imitating the Polish peasants style of dance, and adding flavors of ballet.\n\nThe Krakowiak () is a fast, syncopated Polish dance in duple time from the region of Kraków and Lesser Poland. \n\nThe Kujawiak is a dance from the region of Kuyavia in central Poland. The most romantic of the national dances, the Kujawiak is a slow dance in metre, danced with couples.\n\nThe Mazur is a faster dance in which pairs glide across the floor. The dance is laced heavily with French influences and the dancers move with grace and speed. The Mazur was one of Chopin's biggest influences when composing his music.\n\nThe Oberek is a fast, vivacious dance in time. The word \"oberek\" is derived from \"obrot\" meaning, \"to turn\". Great leaps and feats of athleticism are demonstrated by the men.\n\nThe Polonaise is the most stately of the national dances. Danced in triple () metre, the Polonaise is often the first dance at large events. In Poland, the Polonaise is called the Polonez, or less often the Chodzony (literally, \"walking dance\").\n\nPolish regional dances are ones specific to a given region or city.\n\nSouthern Poland features the culture of the Gorals (Polish highlanders). These dances were brought to this mountain areas with Vlach settlers in the 17th century. Very similar versions can be found at the Gorols in Slovakia and in Czech Republic. The rhythm of their music is different for the otherwise duple or triple-metre of the lowlands.\n\nSilesia was for many centuries a German controlled region with a thriving Polish minority in Upper Silesia. Its songs and dances are simpler and easier.\n\nSilesian songs like \"Szła Dzieweczka\"(The Walking Girl) have been popularized in Poland and abroad thanks to state ensembles Śląsk Song and Dance Ensemble and Mazowsze (folk group).\n\nThe Beskid regions, Slask and Zywiec, are located in the South Western Poland.\n\nThese sea regions have songs and dances focusing imitating sailors and their northern neighbors.\n\nThe songs and dances from the Rzeszow area are focused on being playful. The eastern border of the Voivodeship has a great Ukrainian influence.\n\nThe Lublin area is the most colorful of all the Polish regions. Its dances contain fast polkas like the Cygan (\"Gypsy\") and Polka Podlaska(\"Podlachian Polka\").\n\nPolish folk songs fall under three categories, love, religion, and happiness.\n\nPolish Folk Song and Dance groups (in Polish: \"Zespół Pieśni i Tańca\" or \"ZPiT\") include:\n\n"}

While the Edelweiss brand as a beer dates to 1986, the Hofbräu Kaltenhausen brewery itself was founded in 1475 as 'Kalte Bräuhaus' by the mayor of the village of Kaltenhausen, Johann Elsenhaimer. \n\nAccording to the commercial website, the name Edelweiss is used as a metaphor for the beer's purity and singular uniqueness. The flower is not mentioned as an ingredient. The floral nature is obtained from the top fermented brewing process and its ingredients: pure alpine water, wheat malt, barley malt, hops and top fermented yeast.\n\nThe brand owner, \" Brau Union Österreich AG\", is a subsidiary of Heineken International who also brews in France (in its ) a wheat beer under the same brand but with different marketing and ingredients.\n\nEdelweiss beer, a brand of lager beer brewed by Schoenhofen (Peter) Brewing Co. in Chicago, with no relationship with the former:\nPeter Schoenhofen, a Prussian immigrant, was in Chicago working in the brewing trade by the 1850s. In 1861, he started a partnership with Matheus Gottfried; they were soon operating a brewery at Canalport Avenue and 18th Street where, during the early 1860s, they made about 600 barrels of lager beer a year. <br>In 1867, Schoenhofen bought out his partner, and the company became the Peter Schoenhofen Brewing Co. By 1868, annual output had increased to about 10,000 barrels. During the 1890s, when the business was owned by the City Contract Co. of London, England, annual output reached 180,000 barrels. Around 1900, the Schoenhofen family regained control of the company, which employed about 500 people at its brewery on West 12th Street by 1910. During this time, the company was also known as the National Brewing Co. The company's \"Edelweiss\" brand of beer was a big seller. Operations shut down during Prohibition except for making Green River soda. By 1933, after the national ban on alcohol production was lifted, the company was back in business as the Schoenhofen-Edelweiss Co. Edelweiss was popular among German immigrants as late as the late 1940s in Calumet City, IL. After being purchased by the Atlas Brewing Co. in the late 1940s, Schoenhofen became part of Drewry's Ltd. of South Bend, Indiana, in 1951, and thereafter assumed the Drewry's name, although the Edelweiss name was still marketed into the 1960's. The slogan \"EDELWEISS Beer, Always a Case of Good Judgement!\" is fondly remembered from the radio, T.V. and print advertising of the era. By the beginning of the 1970s, there was nothing left of its Chicago operations, although Drewry's reintroduced the famous Edelweiss brand in 1972 after nearly a decade-long hiatus.

During the cooking process, sometimes toppings are added to the batter.\n\nToday, a large variants of serabi toppings are used, from simple sprinkle of sugar, grated coconut flesh, sprinkles of coarsely ground peanuts, slices of banana or jackfruit, chocolate sprinkles, black glutinous rice, and \"oncom\", to a new recipe using grated cheddar cheese, corned beef, shredded chicken, slices of fresh strawberry or sausage, or even strawberry ice cream. The sauce (or more precisely syrup) to accompany serabi also varies, from traditional sweet \"kinca\" (golden colored coconut sugar syrup) sometimes creamed with coconut milk, to modern recipe using chocolate, strawberry, or durian syrup, and mayonnaise or cream cheese for savoury western twist.\n\nBoth the cities of Bandung and Solo are famous for their versions of serabi. Bandung surabi is drier and firmer with a pancake-like consistency, and today is well known for the rich variant of toppings, most are recently developed fusion recipes. The serabi from Solo, however, is more traditional with a little bit half-cooked with thin, crispy crust and watery center with rich coconut milk taste. A famous serabi variant from Solo is called \"serabi notosuman\".\n\n"}

{"id": "22740094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22740094", "title": "Stolichnaya", "text": "Stolichnaya\n\nStolichnaya (, also known as Stoli) is a vodka made of wheat and rye grain. A well-known Soviet brand, the ownership of Stolichnaya has been disputed since the dissolution of the Soviet Union between Russian state-owned company FKP Soyuzplodimport and SPI Group, a private company founded and owned by Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler.\n\nFermentation of Stolichnaya starts with wheat and rye grains and artesian water. The fermentation takes about 60 hours. Once fermentation is complete the resulting liquid is distilled three times to a strength of 96.4% alcohol by volume. This spirit is then diluted to bottling strength with more artesian well water. It is then filtered through quartz, sand, activated charcoal, and finally through woven cloth.\n\nThe Russian state-owned version Stolichnaya is bottled from artesian water from the Russian city of Samara and the Kaliningrad region, in the ITAR Distillery (Kaliningrad, Russia) within the limits of granted License of the state-owned FKP Союзплодоимпорт (transliterated Sojuzplodoimport or Soyuzplodimport). SPI, a company controlled by Yuri Shefler produces Stolichnaya in Latvia using Latvian water but alcohol from a distillery in Tambov.\n\nStolichnaya is pronounced in Russian . The word is the adjectival form of столица, meaning \"capital city\". \n\nThe Soyuzplodimport bottle label features the words \"Stolichnaya vodka\" in gold cursive script over a drawing of a Moscow landmark, the recently rebuilt Hotel Moskva.\n\nThe SPI Group uses a similar bottle, where the label reads: Premium Vodka, produced and bottled in Latvia for SPI Group and is labeled as Imported Premium Vodka.\n\nStolichnaya has its origins in the Moscow State Wine Warehouse No. 1 which was opened in 1901 by the authorities to ensure higher quality vodka production.\n\nThere is confusion about the actual birth date of Stolichnaya vodka. The earliest confirmed production date is 1948, but the label design clearly predates 1946. It is likely that it was created by V. G. Svirida around 1944. However, there is a trademark registration dated 1938, which is sometimes quoted as another birth date.\n\nIn 1953, Stolichnaya was introduced at the international trade show in Bern and received a gold medal. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, bottles were made in Ukraine for export.\n\nIn 1972, the PepsiCo company struck a barter agreement with the government of the Soviet Union, in which PepsiCo was granted exportation and Western marketing rights to Stolichnaya vodka, in exchange for importation and Soviet marketing of Pepsi-Cola. This exchange led to Pepsi-Cola being the first American consumer product to be produced, marketed and sold in the U.S.S.R. Directly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Stolichnaya vodka continued to be produced for export in several of the ex-Soviet republics, including Ukraine. The bottles retained their Soviet-era labels.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Soviet Union, steps were taken to transform state-owned Stolichnaya producer VO Sojuzplodoimport (later VVO Sojuzplodoimport) into a privately held company. Since the early nineties the personnel of the Vodka factory and factual control of the trademarks were held by VAO Sojuzplodoimport (later: VZAO Sojuzplodoimport), who transferred them in 1997 to ZAO Sojuzplodimport, which sold them in 1999 to the SPI (Spirits) group. SPI Group is a private company chartered in Luxembourg, founded and owned by Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, that distributes a wide variety of Russian spirits, having purchased a number of former Soviet brands and operations. While FKP produces in Kaliningrad, Russia (for the Russian market and the Benelux market), SPI Group distributes and produces from Latvia. State owned company FKP Sojuzplodoimport and the SPI group have been in dispute over the ownership of various trademarks since 2003.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Stolichnaya trademark has been the object of dispute between distributors since 2003, predominantly the SPI Group and Russian state-owned Sojuzplodoimport. The SPI group has held the rights from the legal successor as a result of a privatisation, while the Russian government has held this privatisation has never fully materialised.\n\nIn August 1991, the Soviet patent office revoked the Soviet state-owned company's right to use the Stolichnaya name in Russia. However, in 2002, a Moscow court ruled on appeal that the Government of Russia would get back the rights to the Stolichnaya brand name from SPI Group since – as a result of the incomplete privatisation – it had not obtained the rights from the rights holder. An appeal of SPI with the European Court of Human Rights was rejected.\n\nThe \"Oberlandesgericht\" Linz decided in 2014 that FKP could not base its request on the nullity of the privatization/transformation, as that possibility had a term of limitation of 10 years according to the applicable law in Russia (if the term of limitation defense had been actively relied upon), and that thus FKP could not claim that SPI had not obtained the trademarks from the owner.\n\nIn the Benelux, SPI has been the distributor, but use of the trademarks was challenged in 2006 by the Russian state-owned company FKP Sojuzplodoimport. In 2015, a Dutch court held that the privatisation according to Russian and according to Soviet Union law (and a term of limitation had not been invoked regarding the transfer) had not taken place and that Benelux law and (when provisions were insufficient) Dutch law applied to the transfer of the trademarks. SPI had obtained the trademarks in bad faith from an entity that wasn't the legitimate owner, and thus that the trademarks should be transferred back to FKP Sojuzplodoimport, and that SPI could not use the term \"Russian\" on its vodka.\nAfter the verdict, SPI stopped distribution of Stolichnaya and started selling \"Stoli\" with the motto \"Same Vodka. Different label\", which a Dutch judge forbade in July 2015 as infringing the rights of FKP Sojuzplodoimport. FKP Sojuzplodoimport planned to start selling Stolichnaya in the Netherlands on 1 September 2015.\n\nSPI Group holds the rights to several Stolichnaya trademarks in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, Czech Republic, Spain, Cyprus, Poland, Norway and Iceland. In a lawsuit before the Court of The Hague, FKP Sojuzplodoimport sought an order to return the trademarks from several SPI companies. The Hague court assumed jurisdiction based on two Brussels Regime instruments: Brussels Regulation 44/2001 (for the EU countries) and the 2007 Lugano Convention (Norway, Iceland): it ruled that as the dispute did not relate to trademark validity (for which national courts have jurisdiction) but to trademark registration, for which it could take jurisdiction as a main defendant had his seat located in the Netherlands. For the evaluation of the validity of the trademarks it will use the national law of the trademarks concerned.\n\nPepsiCo had been the distributor of Stolichnaya based on an agreement with the Soviet Government. The change in control of the trademarks and production facilities led to several lawsuits over what company could market vodka under this name in the United States. On November 20, 1992, a US federal judge ruled that PepsiCo would maintain the exclusive right to the name in the United States, as allowing others to market under the name would bring a \"risk of irreparable harm\" to the trademark.\n\nIn 2009, William Grant & Sons signed an agreement with SPI Group to distribute Stolichnaya in the United States, taking over from PepsiCo. The William Grant & Sons distribution contract expired on December 31, 2013 and was not renewed, due to SPI Group's stated desire to manage their brand directly.\n\nIn 2006 FKP Sojuzplodoimport brought against the record owner of the mark Spirits International N.V., et al. in 2005. The district court dismissed almost all claims on a motion to dismiss, holding that the incontestable status of the registration meant that FKP Sojuzplodoimport couldn’t challenge ownership. However, in 2009 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated this decision, stating that FKP Sojuzplodoimport can challenge the validity of the assignment of the trademark.\n\nAfter examining the grant given to FKP Sojuzplodoimport by the Russian government, the district court held in 2011, and the appeals court affirmed in 2013, that the Russian government had not transferred full ownership of the marks to FKP Sojuzplodoimport, so FKP Sojuzplodoimport wasn’t the registrant of the mark. Since FTE had dismissed all claims except for infringement of a registered mark, it didn’t have standing and the case was dismissed.\n\nThen FKP Sojuzplodoimport and the Russian government signed a new assignment document that assigns the trademarks to FKP Sojuzplodoimport in every way possible, and FKP Sojuzplodoimport filed a new lawsuit against Spirits International N.V. The district court in 2014 heard testimony from experts on Russian law and reached a conclusion that under Russian law, FKP Sojuzplodoimport may only manage property, not own it, and, therefore, FKP Sojuzplodoimport does not have standing.However, in 2016 this decision was vacated by the Court of Appeals and the case went back to district court.\n\nStolichnaya is available in many varieties, including:\n\nSeveral of these offerings have performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. For example, the Elit label was awarded a silver medal at the 2011 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.\n\nStolichnaya's chief rival Russian Standard aroused controversy when it questioned Stolichnaya's Russian authenticity, due to the elongated distribution and ownership chain. Pernod Ricard responded by insisting that it is an authentic Russian vodka, as nothing is added or removed during the bottling.\n\nIn Eminem's 2010 music video for \"Love the Way You Lie\", Stolichnaya vodka was included in several scenes. The product placement begins with actor Dominic Monaghan shoplifting a bottle of the vodka, after which he and actress Megan Fox drink from it on the roof of the liquor store.\n\nStolichnaya also advertises heavily with digital banners behind home plate during televised New York Yankees games.\n\nRoger Sterling, a main character in the American television series \"Mad Men\", is also a fan of Stolichnaya, keeping a bottle in his office at all times. This habit appears to be either specially facilitated or anachronistic, however, since the series takes place in New York City the 1960s, roughly a decade before the vodka gained its first official US distribution through PepsiCo (see above).\n\nIn July 2013, columnist Dan Savage joined gay bars and clubs and called for a boycott of Stolichnaya and other Russian vodkas. The boycott is in response to anti-gay laws enacted by the Russian government.\n\nIn response, SPI released a statement expressing their opposition to Russia's anti-gay policies, stating that, \"Stolichnaya Vodka has always been, and continues to be, a fervent supporter and friend to the LGBT community.\"\n\nSPI have released additional statements \"announced that in response to the boycott the company would be making a financial donation to an unspecified group working on behalf of Russian LGBT activists fighting against the Russian government’s anti-gay policies.\" The CEO of the company also insisted that the company is \"not a Russian company\", even though \"the company operates a distillery in Russia, that several hundred of its 2,500 employees are in Russia and that it obtains its ingredients from Russia.\"\n\n"}

The recipe for the sandwich has been published in numerous cookbooks and newspaper stories. It is sold commercially in restaurants that specialize in peanut butter sandwiches, such as Peanut Butter & Co.\n\nThe peanut butter and banana sandwich has been referred to as a favorite of Elvis Presley, who was renowned for his food cravings such as the Fool's Gold Loaf, a loaf of Italian bread filled with a pound each of bacon, peanut butter, and grape jelly.

It is often referred to using his name.\n\nPresley's fondness for peanut butter and banana sandwiches is well established; however, bacon is not mentioned in all accounts. A book about Presley and his mother, Gladys Presley, though, says he had \"sandwich after sandwich of his favorite—peanut butter, sliced bananas, and crisp bacon\".

'Pill' is also a verb for the formation of such balls.\n\nPilling is a surface defect of textiles caused by wear, and is generally considered an undesirable trait. It happens when washing and wearing of fabrics causes loose fibers to begin to push out from the surface of the cloth, and, over time, abrasion causes the fibers to develop into small spherical bundles, anchored to the surface of the fabric by protruding fibers that haven't broken. The textile industry divides pilling into four stages: fuzz formation, entanglement, growth, and wear-off. \n\nPilling normally happens on the parts of clothing that receive the most abrasion in day-to-day wear, such as the collar, cuffs, and around the thighs and rear on trousers.\n\nAll fabrics pill to some extent, although fibers such as linen and silk pill less than most. The primary drivers of pilling are the physical characteristics of the textile (including both the initial fibre, and the way in which it is processed during manufacturing), the personal habits of the textile's wearer, and the environment in which the textile is used. Fibers such as wool, cotton, polyester, nylon and acrylic have a tendency to pill the most, but wool pilling diminishes over time as non-tenacious wool fibers work themselves free of the fabric and break away, whereas pilling of synthetic textiles is a more serious problem, because the stronger fibers hold on to the pills preventing them from falling off.\n\nIn general longer fibers pill less than short ones because there are fewer ends of fibers, and because it is harder for the longer fibers to work themselves out of the cloth. Fabrics with a large number of loose fibers have a higher tendency to pill. Also, knitted fabrics tend to pill more than woven fabrics, because of the greater distance between yarn crossings in knitted fabrics than in woven ones. For the same reason, a tightly knitted object will pill less than a loosely knitted one. When a fabric is made of a blend of fibers where one fibre is significantly stronger than the other, pills tend to form as the weaker fibre wears and breaks, and the stronger fibre holds the pills onto the cloth.\n\nTechniques used by the textile industry to avoid pilling include singeing the loose fibers protruding on the surface of textile, and spinning the yarn with a high number of twists per inch. Some fabrics are chemically treated during the manufacturing process in order to reduce their propensity to pill. Polymeric coatings are sometimes applied to bind fibers into the fabric surface and prevent initial fuzz from forming. Polyester and cotton fibers are sometimes modified to be of lower-than-normal strength, which results in pills detaching easily from fabrics, once they are formed. Cellulase enzymes are sometimes used on cotton fabrics during wet processing, which removes loose fibers.\n\nTextile authorities say consumers can prevent or postpone pilling of their fabrics by treating them with chemical soil release treatments that make the surface of the fabric more hydrophilic, and by turning clothes inside out before washing them. Washing in laundry detergent containing enzymes will get rid of pills on cotton clothing.\n\nPills do not interfere with the functionality of the textile, unless a spot with a lot of pills turns into a hole in the fabric. This is because both pills and holes are caused by the fabric wearing—a pill is fibre that was in the cloth. After the pill forms the fabric is thinner there, increasing the likelihood that a hole will form.\n\nPilling can seriously compromise a textile's acceptability for consumers, and is the focus of significant industry research. In the textile industry, severity of pilling is objectively evaluated using five parameters: pill number, the mean area of pilling; the total area of pilling; contrast, and density.\n\n"}

The bacon donut has been described as tasting like a \"camping breakfast\" (Pancakes with maple syrup, breakfast sausage links, and strips of bacon) all in one convenient item.\n\nThe Swirls bakery in Omaha, Nebraska started a \"maple bacon donut craze\" with its version sometimes referred to as \"The Elvis\". The bakery's owner, Dawn Brown, said she wanted something shocking that people would love or hate, and would talk about. She describes the concept as simple: \"It's your breakfast plate turned into one item that you put in your mouth.\" She reported: response from her customers has been overwhelming, and she prepares five pounds of bacon daily. \"I know that most people are coming for the maple bacon donut a.k.a. 'The Elvis'.\"\n\nDynamo Donut, in San Francisco, California, also serves maple bacon donuts.\n\nAt Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon, maple bacon donuts are sold under the name \"Bacon Maple Bar\".\n\nThe Original Pantry Cafe in Los Angeles, described as the area's favorite greasy spoon that \"has kept the faith for 85 years\", offers maple-glazed bacon doughnuts for breakfast at its downtown location.\n\nThe Nickel Diner, in downtown Los Angeles, also serves up the treat and has the slogan \"Home of the Maple Glaze Bacon Donut\" on its website. Writing about reclusive author John Twelve Hawks, Carolyn Kellogg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" opined that the Nickel Diner maple-bacon doughnut \"is so good, it should be able to get anyone to come out of hiding.\"\n\nNord's Bakery, on the edge of Germantown in Louisville, Kentucky, debuted a maple bacon Long John in 2009. \"It looks just like any other maple cream Long John, but for the slab of bacon embedded in the icing,\" \"The argument in favor is clear: a Maple-Bacon Long John is basically an order of pancakes, maple syrup and bacon that you can carry around in a bag and eat in the car with no utensils other than a napkin\" and \"it's something every bacon lover ought to try,\" the \"Courier-Journal\" reported.\n\n"}

Variants may include the addition of Bloody Mary mix. Although not a vodka martini, which consists of vodka and vermouth, the term \"bacon martini\" is consistent with the trend of calling any straight liquor in a martini glass a \"martini,\" such as the saketini or other variations.\n\nThe bacon martini was invented independently by Sang Yoon, owner of the gastropub Father's Office in Santa Monica, California, and P. Moss, owner of the Double Down Saloon in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sang Yoon made his bacon martini in 1998, inspired by the Bacon of the Month Club run by the Grateful Palate in Fairfield, California. P. Moss appears to have concocted his bacon martini the same year. Sang Yoon's version of the drink uses juniper-cured bacon, while P. Moss's method calls for hickory-smoked bacon.\n\nTo make a bacon martini, the vodka needs to be prepared in advance through a process called fat washing. This is done by soaking strips of cooked bacon in vodka and straining off the fat, similar to the process for marinating meat before cooking. The drink is ready when the liquid becomes filmy and opaque. At the Double Down Saloon in the East Village in New York City, the bacon martini is created by straining the bacon-infused vodka through shaken ice and serving it in a martini glass with a piece of bacon at the bottom, similar to the worm in a bottle of mezcal.\n\nThe taste of bacon martinis is similar to that of vodka martinis, but with a spicier and saltier bacon flavor and a tangy \"heat\". According to a saloon owner, the pork fat reacts with vodka to give the drink its unique taste. Reviews of the beverage have been varied, with one drinker comparing it to Castrol motor oil, and a bacon enthusiast saying it was a satisfying and delicious beverage on many levels. A club in San Francisco was selling bacon martinis with bourbon instead of vodka (which is actually a Mitch Morgan), arguing that vodka absorbs too much of the charcoal smokiness flavor.\n\n"}

{"id": "22881131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22881131", "title": "Santa Maria-style barbecue", "text": "Santa Maria-style barbecue\n\nSanta Maria-style barbecue is a regional culinary tradition rooted in the Santa Maria Valley in Santa Barbara County on the Central Coast of California. This method of barbecuing dates back to the mid-19th century and is today regarded as a \"mainstay of California's culinary heritage.\" The traditional Santa Maria-style barbecue menu was copyrighted by the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce in 1978.\n\nSanta Maria-style barbecue centers around beef tri-tip, seasoned with black pepper, salt, and garlic before grilling over coals of native coast live oak, often referred to as \"red oak\" wood. The grill is made of iron and usually has a hand crank that lifts or lowers the grill over the coals to the desired distance from the heat. The Santa Maria Valley is often rather windy, so the style of cooking is over an oxidative fire as opposed to a reductive fire that many covered barbecues use.\n\nThe traditional accompaniments are pinquito beans, fresh salsa, tossed green salad, and grilled French bread dipped in sweet melted butter.\n\nSome regional variations within the Central Coast include sausage (such as linguica or chorizo) or venison, grilled alongside the tri-tip or in the beans, and fresh strawberries.\n\nSanta Maria-style barbecue originated in the mid-19th century when local ranchers would host Spanish-style feasts each spring for their \"vaqueros\". They barbecued meat over earthen pits filled with hot coals of local coast live oak. The meal was served with pinquitos, small pink beans that are considered indigenous to the Santa Maria Valley.\n\nAccording to local barbecue historian R. H. Tesene, \"The Santa Maria Barbecue grew out of this tradition and achieved its 'style' when local residents began to string cuts of beef on skewers or rods and cook the meat over the hot coals of a red oak fire.\"\n\nIn 1931, the Santa Maria Club started a \"Stag Barbecue\", which was held on the second Wednesday of every month, with up to 700 patrons attending each event. By the late 1950s, three local restaurants—The Far Western Tavern, Hitching Post, and Jocko's were on their way to becoming landmarks of this style of barbecue. The Elks Lodge #1538 has huge indoor barbecue pits, and host what is called \"Cook Your Own\" every Friday evening. The original cut was top sirloin. Then, as today, the meat was rolled in a mixture of salt, pepper, and garlic salt before being barbecued over the red oak coals, which contribute a smoky, hearty flavor. In the 1950s, a local butcher named Bob Schutz (Santa Maria Market) perfected the tri-tip, a triangular bottom sirloin cut that quickly joined top sirloin as a staple of Santa Maria-style barbecue.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan was an avid fan of Santa Maria-style barbecue. Local barbecue chef Bob Herdman and his Los Compadres Barbecue Crew staged several barbecues for President Reagan, including five feasts on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nPinquito beans are an essential component of the traditional Santa Maria-style barbecue menu. They are a cross between a pink bean and a small white bean, and grow well in the fertile soil and mild climate of the Santa Maria Valley. Betteravia Farms began growing pinquito beans commercially in 1972. Another specialty purveyor of pinquito beans and other Santa Maria-style barbecue foods is Susie Q's Brand.\n\n"}
{"id": "22886704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22886704", "title": "Paint recycling", "text": "Paint recycling\n\nPaint is a recyclable item. Latex paint is collected at collection facilities in many countries and shipped to paint-recycling facilities.\n\nThere are many ways that paint can be recycled. Most often, the highest quality of latex paint is sorted out and turned back into recycled paint that can be used. Recycled paint is environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality. In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested. The paint is adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary. Finally, the paint is fine filtered and packaged for sale.\n\nPaint that cannot be reused has other environmentally friendly uses. Non-reusable paint can be made into a product used in cement manufacturing, thereby recycling virtually 100% of the original paint.\n\nRecycling one gallon of paint could save 13 gallons of water, 1 quart of oil, and 250,000 gallons of water pollution, 13.74 pounds of , save enough energy to power the average home for 3 hours, or cook 6 meals in a microwave oven, or blow dry someone's hair 27 times.\n\nIn Ontario, Stewardship Ontario oversees the collection of waste paint from consumers and diversion from landfill to meet targets approved by the Ministry of the Environment through a program called the Orange Drop Program. The Orange Drop program is an extensive and growing network of collection sites—drop-off locations for paint leftovers and other special materials that can’t go in the Blue Box or the garbage.\nAs an Orange Drop-approved transporter and processor, Loop Recycled Products Inc. takes leftover paint, collected through Stewardship Ontario, and turns it into 12 shades of premium, affordable and environmentally friendly recycled paint. Reusing top-quality residual paint (on average, the original retail value of a gallon of incoming paint is approximately $30) enables Loop to create premium products without the raw material costs and energy consumption needed to make paint from scratch.\nSince 2012, Loop Recycled Products Inc. has diverted over 6 million litres of paint from disposal in Ontario’s landfills, incineration and waterways and is committed to innovation and solving Canada’s waste paint problem.\n\nIn February 2015 Waste Diversion Ontario approved Product Care as the new Ontario waste paint stewardship operator effectively replacing Stewardship Ontario.\n\nIn March 2017, Colortech ECO Paints introduced its line of recycled wall and floor paints to specific retail markets consisting of a large network of liquidation and discount stores across Canada and the United States., as well as exporting large quantities to West Africa and South America.\n\nAlberta’s paint recycling program started accepting leftover, unwanted paint on April 1, 2008. It is estimated that about 30 million liters of paint is sold in Alberta each year. On average, 5 to 10 percent of this ends up as waste, which can pose environmental and health risks if disposed of improperly. Paint contains many components that have great potential for reuse, recycling and recovery. The Paint Recycling Alberta program enables these products to be handled and recycled in an environmentally safe manner, reducing their impact on the environment. The program is funded through environmental fees charged on the sale of new paint in Alberta. The fees are put into a dedicated fund that can only be used to manage the paint recycling program. \nThe paint is sorted into different streams and sent to registered processors to be recycled into new paint, used in other products or in energy recovery, or sent for proper disposal if necessary. Any processor that receives paint must be registered with the Paint Recycling Program and meet all applicable environmental, transportation, health & safety, and local requirements. \n\nCalibre Environmental LTD. (CEL) located in Calgary, Alberta, became a key part in 2008 of the new Alberta Paint Stewardship program which significantly increased the recycling of unused latex paint from across the province of Alberta. Calibre Environmental Ltd. currently processes about 1.6 million kilograms of latex paint annually, which equates to the successful recycling of one million litres of quality latex paint per year.\n\nIn the UK reusable leftover paint can be donated to Community RePaint, a national network of paint reuse schemes. The network comprises local schemes run by not-for-profit organisations, local authorities or waste management companies, in the Community RePaint network. The schemes collect surplus paint from trade sources i.e. painters, decorators, retailers, manufacturers, and/or leftover paint donated by householders at council household waste and recycling centres (also known as tips). The paint is then sorted by staff and volunteers before being redistributed to local charities, community groups, families and individuals in need. The Community RePaint network, is sponsored by Dulux (part of AkzoNobel), managed by an environmental consultancy, Resource Futures and has been cited as an example of best practice for the management of surplus paint in a report by the European Commission and by DEFRA in Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy. \n\nThere are also a handful of companies recycling paint in the UK, but only two reprocessing waste paint, back into the quality of virgin paint; Newlife Paints. Newlife Paints was formed in 2008 after Keith Harrison, an industrial chemist, developed a process that converted waste emulsion paint back into full quality, commercial grade paint. Castle RePaint, part of the social enterprise company Castle Furniture also consolidates unwanted emulsion paint into brand new 'RePaint' in a range of colours.\n\nConcerns about the life cycle of paint have led to the creation of PaintCare, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization established to represent paint manufacturers (paint producers) to plan and operate paint stewardship programs in the United States in those states that pass paint stewardship laws. \n\nPaint stewardship law aims to enable the paint industry to implement a collection program that allows consumers to take their leftover, unwanted paint to a collection site to be collected and recycled. Legislation mandating the creation of the PaintCare program has been enacted in eight states since 2009: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, Minnesota, Maine, and Colorado. Legislation has also been passed for the District of Columbia; PaintCare anticipates beginning the District's paint stewardship program in September 2016. PaintCare is responsible for promoting the reuse of post-consumer architectural paint (leftover paint) and providing for the collection, transport, and processing of this paint using the hierarchy of \"reduce, reuse, recycle,\" and proper disposal. Most PaintCare locations are at paint retailers who volunteer to take back paint. These retailers take back paint during regular business hours, making paint recycling and disposal much more convenient for the public.\n\nPaint is shipped to companies such as GDB International, Amazon Paint, American Paint Recyclers (Ohio), Metro Paint (Oregon), UCI Environmental (Nevada) and Kelly Moore, Visions Paint Recycling, Inc (California)& Williams Paint Recycling Company. In the Southern California area, Acrylatex Coatings & Recycling, Inc. accepts unused/unwanted latex paints for reprocessing into a viable resource of recycled paints in 20-standard colors. In the southeastern United States Atlanta Paint Disposal has a paint recycling program with drop off locations in Atlanta, Georgia. In the northeast The Paint Exchange, LLC recycles latex paint under the brand recolor®. In the Mid-Atlantic RepaintUSA also recycles paint with a focus on businesses, public and private sources. \n\nA new charitable organization known as The Global Paint for Charity incorporated in Georgia, US, has as its mission to collect leftover paint from residents and businesses nationwide and use it for global housing rehabilitation projects, including homes, schools, hospitals, jails and churches for vulnerable families in developing countries. They partner with non-profit organizations with existing operations in these continents for paint distribution. Through the support of their donors and partners they are able to improve communities, increase access to quality paints and protect the environment.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that every homeowner in the US has 3 to 4 gallons of leftover paints in their basement, and 10 percent of those paints ends up in landfills. \n\nOne gallon of improperly disposed paint has the ability to pollute up to 250,000 gallons of water. \n\nBy participating in the program, individuals and businesses will take greater steps to protect the environment, and improve living conditions for vulnerable populations throughout the world. If you would like to support the Global Paint for Charity, they encourage you to take action today.\n\nImprove access of high-quality paints to vulnerable populations around the world. Nearly 2.5 billion people in developing countries live on less than $2 a day. For them, paint is very expensive. In these settings, it is very difficult for families to secure sufficient income for their basic needs (including but not limited to: food, medicine, water, clothes, school supplies, and shelter). When making consumption choices that involve spending on their basic needs there is nothing left to spend on paint. The paint shortage affects many other areas of the world, where communities lack even the most basic need and materials to uplift their people. For the world’s poorest communities, home isn’t just where the heart is. Dirt walls and neglected communities are not attractive to tourists, putting those who cannot afford paint, not only at the greatest risk of life-threatening of bad germs but also lack of economic opportunities.\n\nSince it started years ago, as many as 500–6000 gallons of paint have been shipped at a time to developing countries, including Kenya, Uganda, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Guyana, Guinea, Ghana, Jamaica and Mexico, 240 volunteers have painted 459 family homes and 40 schools and orphanages with over 150,000 gallons of donated paint from businesses and residences.\n\nGlobal Paint for Charity continues to expand and impact our communities around the world. They do this through working directly with their volunteers, donors, and partners. From developing paint projects that engage their employees in the beautification of the community; to run frequent local paint drives to support their program.\n\nGlobal Paint for Charity has recently won the National Energy Globe Award of United States 2017. With more than 178 participating countries and over 2,000 project submissions annually the Energy Globe Award is today's most prestigious environmental prize worldwide. The Austrian Honorary Consul General, Mr. Ferdinand C. Seefried hosted an exclusive ceremony to present the National Energy Globe Award 2017 for the United States to Mr. Rony Delgarde, Global Paint for Charity.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1978, after a few years of the colonel's declining health, Norbert Wabnig, who had worked at the store by day while pursuing his music career at night, purchased the business and changed its name to The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills. He transformed the store's feel from one of an upscale chain store to the more European style that it retains today. Wabnig has often stated that he likes the community aspect of the store, which often hosts wine tastings.\n\nAs a way of recognizing the producers of handmade specialty foods from whom he sources his products, in 2004 Wabnig founded the American Artisanal Treasure Awards. Awards are presented for Best Cheese, Best Olive Oil, and Best Condiment.\n\nIn 2005, the store introduced its house wine, Scoundrel, a cabernet bottled by Sylvester Vineyards in Paso Robles, California. Wabnig's daughter, Talia, designed the label.\n\nBecause of its epicurean nature, The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills has been known to carry hard-to-find and high-end ingredients, which over the years have included Austrian pumpkin seed oil, fresh truffles (in season), varieties of French butter, various kinds of Russian caviar (Golden Imperial Osetra and Sevruga), French and Spanish hams, Italian prosciutto, and 25 varieties of extra virgin olive oil. As part of the store's environmental ethos customers are encouraged to bring their own bottles, which are then filled with olive oil.\n\nBorn in Vienna, Austria, on August 11, 1948, Norbert Wabnig and his family moved to New Orleans in 1955, but returned during summers to Vienna, where he apprenticed in the kitchen of his uncle Franz Blauensteiner's restaurant, Gausthaus au Stadt Paris, a popular spot for celebrities such as Oskar Werner and Klaus Maria Brandauer. After graduating from the University of New Orleans, Wabnig moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music career with his band Wendell Nightfall Troupe. To support himself, Wabnig took a job at what is now The Cheese Store of Beverly Hills, which he later bought in 1978.\n\nWabnig travels the world in search of cheeses for the store. He is a member of the American Cheese Society and often assists top culinary schools – including The Cordon Bleu Program at the California School of Culinary Arts, and The New School of Cooking – with cheese courses.\n\nWabnig and Ruthie Grahm composed the theme song for the Los Angeles chapter of Meals on Wheels.\n\nEat, Drink or Die. Wabnig hosted a Cheese of the Day video series for the popular epicurean website.\n\nIn 2007, Wabnig appeared on the History (formerly, The History Channel) series \"Modern Marvels\", as a cheese expert.\n\n"}

The calls disturbed his fellow students, causing them to throw miscellaneous objects out their dorm windows. In 1921, the Pennsylvania Gazette reported that Pennsylvania's victory in an intercollegiate basketball championship was celebrated with a \"time-honored\" Rowbottom, accompanied by a large bonfire that lighted up the night. \n\nSoon the call \"Hey Rowbottom!\" or \"Yea Rowbottom!\" became embraced as a call to mischief-making by the University of Pennsylvania student body. Once a Rowbottom got underway, automobiles might be overturned, windows smashed, and trolley tracks doused with gasoline and set ablaze. In the 1940s \"panty raids\" of the women's dormitories became a prominent feature. Rowbottoms were most frequent in the fall, particularly after football games.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the University and the police took a firmer stance against Rowbottoms, and 1966 marked the last \"full-fledged\" Rowbottom. Attempts to revive the tradition were made throughout the 1970s, with the last recorded event occurring in 1980.

Hongeo-hoe is made from skate and emits a very strong, characteristic ammonia-like odor that has been described as being \"reminiscent of an outhouse\".\n\nSkates (\"hongeo\") are cartilaginous fish that excrete uric acid through the skin, rather than by urinating as other animals do. As they ferment, ammonia is produced which helps preserve the flesh and gives the fish its distinctive, powerful odor.\n\nThe natural preservative effect of the fermentation process on skate meat was noted by Korean fishermen as early as the 14th century, during the Goryeo dynasty, long before refrigeration was invented. It was found that skates were the only fish that could be transported over long distances or stored for extended periods without rotting, even in the absence of salt.\n\nOriginally, the skates used in the production of hongeo-hoe were harvested locally from the waters around Heuksando, an island off the southwestern coast of Korea. In more recent years, a larger proportion has been made with less expensive imported fish, mainly from Chile, although skate from Heuksando still retains a reputation for superior quality.\n\nSpecific production techniques vary from shop to shop, influenced in part by the local climate. According to the traditional method, after the fish are cleaned and eviscerated, they would be stored either in compost (in cold regions) or in piles of straw (in warmer regions) and left to ferment. In the present day, due to concerns over food safety and product consistency, the use of refrigeration has become more common. Under one modern method, the fish undergo fermentation in a walk-in refrigerator for as much as 15 days at 2.5 °C, and then for approximately 15 more days at 1 °C.\n\nAfter fermentation, the preserved skates are sliced into small pieces and packed into boxes for shipment.\n\nHongeo-hoe is typically presented to diners as small slabs, sashimi-style, without being subjected to cooking or further preparation. \n\nJeolla natives claim that hongeo-hoe should be consumed plain. However, the dish is often eaten together with bossam and kimchi, a combination known as \"hongeo samhap\". It may also be served with the Korean alcoholic beverage makgeolli, which could help diners cope with the pungency of the fermented dish. \n\n"}
{"id": "23213555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23213555", "title": "Dhammakaya Movement UK", "text": "Dhammakaya Movement UK\n\nThe Dhammakaya Movement is one distinct tradition of Thai Buddhism that has had a pioneering role in establing Buddhist practice in England since 1954.\n\n The Dhammakaya Tradition has been known as a specific lineage of Thai Buddhism in Britain since Ţhitavedo visited in October 1953. His protégé William Purfurst (a.k.a. Kapilavaḍḍho Bhikkhu, Richard Randall)(1906–71) travelled to Thailand with Ṭhitavedo as a novice in March 1954 and took higher ordination at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, the first European to ordain in Thailand. As the result of subsequent training with Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro, he said to have attained the Dhammakaya and returning to England on 12 November 1954, visiting London and Manchester and founding the English Sangha Trust in July 1955. Three disciples travelled with Kapilavaḍḍho to Thailand on 30 December 1955 and took higher ordination at Wat Paknam on 27 January 1956. These ordinands were Peter Morgan (a.k.a. Paññavaḍḍho Bhikkhu), Robert Albison (a.k.a. Saddhāvaḍḍho Bhikkhu) and George Blake (a.k.a. Vijjāvaḍḍho Bhikkhu). After some time, all four bhikkhus moved to Wat That Thong, Sukhumvit Road, from which time onwards Kapilavaḍḍho and all his subsequent disciples appear to have practised a more eclectic form of Buddhism. Ananda Bodhi (a.k.a. Leslie Dawson, Namgyal Rinpoche), who may have met Paññavaḍḍho in the period 1956-61, went to Wat Paknam for training in the period 1963-4 and returned to England to teach the Dhammakaya method in April 1964 at Biddulph Old Hall, but by August 1964 had changed to teach Burmese Insight meditation. Remnants of Dhammakaya teaching were perpetuated by Acharn Kaew Potikanok's (1926–86) student Fuengsin (née Sarayutpitak) Trafford (1936–95) who practised Dhammakaya meditation until her death. She claims to have fulfilled a prophecy Kaew Potikanok made 15 years earlier that she would spread Buddhism in England, having taught meditation from c.1975 at Birmingham Buddhist Vihara to children on Sundays and English adults each Monday. She also edited the newsletter \"Children & Dharma\" for that temple. She taught Buddhism and meditation in various mainstream schools, colleges, universities and prisons. In 1984, Sister Dr. Mary Hall (1928–2008) invited her to teach Buddhism in the Multi-Faith Centre, Harborne Hall, Birmingham and to graduate groups. She was for a time a Buddhist Prison Chaplain from 1986. She also taught as part of Religious Education in schools such as King Edward VI College, Stourbridge, under the direction of Alan Keightley.\n\nA second phase of the spread of the Dhammakaya tradition in the UK started in the wake of the Thai migration phenomenon – one monk from Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Pathum Thani being sent to study for a bachelor's degree at University of Oxford in 1986 and attracting a succession of English people to visit Wat Phra Dhammakaya in Thailand in the period 1987-1991. Phra Maha Wirat Manikanto completed an MA in Buddhist Studies at the University of Bristol in 1997 and during his stay built up a group of Thai supporters mostly from London and Cheltenham who started to organize the first Sunday of the month celebrations from 1998. These were initially at a house in Bristol in 1997. From 21 April 1999 a small house was rented in Wimbledon (within earshot of Wat Buddhapadipa), with Phra Maha Wirat as abbot and Phra Jirasak Caranasampanno, two laymen, Anuchit Treerattanajutawat and Phibul Choompolpaisal supporting the monks while studying for master's degrees in London universities and for a short time a laywoman Sriwan. The tradition registered as a non-profit organization “the Dhammakaya International Society of the United Kingdom” or ‘DISUK’ on 16 April 2002. Later in the same year, in keeping with Dhammakaya Foundation’s policy of rotating personnel, Phra Asadang Siripuñño took over as abbot, moving the temple to a much larger rented premises in Norbury on 7 July 2002. The temple was named Wat Charoenbhavana London. A new abbot, Phrakru Sangharak Wairot Virojano and Phra Thammasarn Cittabhārano took over the running of the temple for the Buddhist lent of 2003. DISUK was granted charitable status on 26 May 2004. At the same time the search continued for a permanent premises for the London temple.\n\nIn the meanwhile, a second support group in Manchester requested Wat Phra Dhammakaya in Thailand to set up a temple on 18 December 2003. Phra Asadang and Upasaka Anuchit moved north as the pioneering team, with Phra Wut Suvuddhiko succeeding as abbot in 2004. The temple found its first location in rented accommodation at a large former curtain-rail factory at Cheltenham Street, Salford. Phra Praphit Brahmasubho succeeded as abbot in 200?. Various uncanny events surrounded the establishment of Wat Charoenbhavana Manchester including the finding of a 2-metre tall Buddha Image at the side of a road in Wales – which was salvaged as the temples’ first Buddha image. In 2008 the temple moved to a permanent premises in Edgeley and was renamed 'Wat Phra Dhammakaya (Manchester)' or the 'North-West Centre for Buddhist Meditation' - being granted status as a place of worship in 2009. Phra Maha Sairung Thirarojano has been abbot of the new premises from 2009 to present.\n\nThe London temple negotiated the purchase of the old Brookwood Hospital Chapel at Knaphill in 2004 – a building which had previously been derelict for six years at the time of purchase. The first incumbent was Phra Kru Sangarak Wairot Vairochano who used his considerable construction experience and the architectural designs of Phra Pichit Thitachayo to convert and refurbish the building into a functioning Buddhist centre in 2005. The centre was brought up to UK safety requirements and officially opened by Woking’s Mayor Cllr. Bryan Cross on 28 October 2007. Wat Charoenbhavana London officially changed its name to Wat Phra Dhammakaya London in 200?.\n\nA centre has also been established in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the derelict Saint Andrews Church. The church is a Grade II listed building which was built in 1872 by shipbuilding magnate Andrew Leslie of the Hawthorn Leslie shipyard. Preparing the centre required a huge refurbishment. As of 2015, the refurbishment was in progress, and attempts were made to try and maintain the heritage. The centre has activities for both Thai immigrants and English local inhabitants. The centre also holds traditional ceremonies open to the public, which are sometimes joined by the local mayor and mayoresse. The center also organizes teachings in the local area, such as the Beacon Museum. As of 2015, the center was run by Phra Samuh Phichit Thitachayao.\n\nIn 2016, another centre was founded in Helensburgh, Scotland. As of 2016, the centre was run by Phramaha Amaro, and holds meditation classes regularly.\n\nThe Dhammakaya temples in the UK are the hubs of a network of Dhammakaya practitioners extending from Scotland to the West country. As with many Asian-rooted Buddhist centres in the west, two distinct interest groups frequent the Dhammakaya temples. The first group is predominantly Thai expatriates with a congregation up to 300 strong in Manchester and 400 strong in London and a mailing list of previous visitors reaching the thousands. The second group is the English speaking (convert) group of practitioners which in London is up to fifty strong with a mailing list of up to 400 previous visitors. Other groups regularly visiting the temple are Buddhist families from the expatriate Singhalese, Bangladeshi and Nepalese communities.\n\nTen years on, the Dhammakaya practice community of the UK has established a network of local support groups presently in Doncaster, Sheffield, Scotland and Cyprus for the Manchester temple. Brighton, Worthing, Cheltenham, Kent, Swindon and Ireland have monthly groups served by the London temple – and monks are sent regularly to support English language meditation activities in Zurich, Geneva and Ireland. The temples have also been involved with policy-making concerning Buddhism in the UK with participation in TBSUK, NBO, Greenwich Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education, chaplaincy, the SE Buddhist Forum and in 2006 was the first temple to introduce Sanam Luang Dhamma Studies in Europe.\n\n"}

Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in aqueous sedimentary environments this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.\nGenerally speaking, the common feature (sphericity) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).\n\nSeveral types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as oolites, micrometeorites, impact spherulites, iberulites, pisolites, aerolites, chondrules, biolites, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Food writer Mary Cadogan says that \"Egg and chips for me is a marriage made in heaven. Whenever I feel the need of a bit of comfort eating this is the dish I usually turn to.\" Heston Blumenthal, owner of the Michelin star award-winning Fat Duck restaurant in Berkshire, wrote in \"The Guardian\" that \"You can't get much more British a dish than fried egg and chips.\"\n\nEgg and chips is associated with a working-class diet, and one writer has even cited it as a dish which members of the middle classes might find \"shameful\" in wanting. In an article on moving from the working class to the middle class, a British journalist recounted that \"There are things I grew up with that I still love—pub life, darts, egg and chips\". Jack Charlton, after playing in the World Cup-winning England football team in 1966, remarked: \"We stopped the car for egg and chips in a transport cafe. We'd eaten nothing but the best food for weeks and I was dying for some ordinary grub.\" The image of British people insisting on ordering egg and chips while on holiday abroad has also been used as a stereotype.\n\nIn a study on the perceptions of social inequality of people in North West England, \"Beer, fags, egg and chips\" was highlighted by the researchers as an example of individual behaviour thought to be connected to poor health.\n\nIn Tanzania, egg and chips—called chipsi mayai locally—is sold by street vendors, and is associated with poor nutrition and hygiene.\n\nEgg and chips was John Lennon's favourite food. His Aunt Mimi would prepare it for him with a cup of tea.\n\nThe dish features in art as well as in real life. Egg and chips occupies a pivotal moment in the suffocating life of a working-class Liverpool housewife in \"Shirley Valentine\". \"Because it's Thursday, Shirley knows that Joe expects steak and chips for his tea. He is getting egg and chips instead... But Joe ... is not pleased at his meatless meal. He pushes his plate into her lap. That settles it. Two weeks later he comes home and finds an empty house.\"\n\nIn an episode from season 8 of \"Are You Being Served?\", a store video featuring the face of Miss Brahms and the deep, sexy voice of Mr Grace's nurse attracts the attention of Lord Hirly, who invites Miss Brahms and her family to be his guests at the very posh \"Romano's\" restaurant. Captain Peacock and Mrs Slocombe stand in for Mr and Mrs Brahms, while Mr Humphries plays a bishop. On seeing the prices, Mrs Slocombe remarks that, on \"their\" wages, all they could afford would be egg and chips - but as Lord Hirly is footing the bill, they order pâté de foie gras, pheasant, guinea fowl, and venison. His Lordship does arrive but, alas, it was the nurse's low, sexy voice that attracted him - and she happens to be dining at the next table, so that's the end of Miss Brahms's upward mobility. Captain Peacock then calls over the waiter to request a slight change in their order: \"Egg and chips four times, and a pot of tea.\" \n\nThe dish's status as a cornerstone of authentic British cuisine is solidified by its regular inclusion in modern popular culture. It features regularly in television depictions of British life, such as the long-running soap series \"Coronation Street\", where it constitutes part of recurring character Johnny \"Doc\" Docherty's infamous catch phrase, \"You've just had your tea, Lesley - Egg and Chips!\".\n\nEgg and chips was also a favourite food for Tommies behind the lines on the Western Front during WW1, often washed down with cheap French wine 'plonk'.\n\n"}

They were invented in 1825. Sometimes called pastilles of Vichy ( or ), they are recognizable as a white, octagonal type of candy pastille bearing the word \"Vichy\" in all-caps.\n\nThe Vichy Pastilles brand belonged to the Vichy-Etat Company in 1940. It was acquired by Cadbury France, a division of Cadbury, in 2003. It later belonged to Kraft Foods (later known as Mondelez International). In 2016, it was purchased by Eurazeo, a French company, for 250 million Euros.\n\nThe pastilles were invented in 1825 in Vichy, a spa town in the department of Allier, France. As early as 1839, they were originally made purely from bicarbonate of soda and taken for their digestive properties. Empress Eugénie de Montijo is said to have been a fan. Later, they were made with mineral salts extracted from the local spring water. Nowadays, they include sugar and are flavoured with mint, lemon, or aniseed.\n\nThe pastilles were mentioned by French author Guy de Maupassant in his short story, \"The Magic Couch\".\n\nDuring World War II, the sweets were used as \"branding and marketing\" by Vichy France. By August 1942, shops in Vichy gave Vichy pastilles to customers, while other victuals were rationed. However, the mayor of Vichy decided to mark sweets as cheese on their ration cards to avoid running out of them.\n\nIn \"Einstein's Beets: An Examination of Food Phobias\", American author Alexander Theroux opines that due to its connotation to Vichy France, \"many French citizens are still made uneasy\" by hearing the phrase. In \"The Long Aftermath: Cultural Legacies of Europe at War, 1936-2016\", Manuel Bragança and Peter Tame agree, as they argue that Vichy France's use of the sweets as propaganda eventually \"backfired.\"\n\n\n"}

Hamburgers are often served with various condiments, such as mustard, mayonnaise, and ketchup, and other options including lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese.\n\nThe Texas historian Frank X. Tolbert attributes the invention of the hamburger to Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas. Davis is believed to have sold hamburgers at his café at 115 Tyler Street in Athens, Texas, in the late 1880s, before bringing them to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.\n\nResidents of Hamburg, New York, which was named after Hamburg, Germany, attribute the hamburger to Ohioans Frank Menches and Charles Menches. According to legend, the Menches brothers were vendors at the 1885 Erie County Fair (then called the Buffalo Fair) when they ran out of sausage for sandwiches and used beef instead. They named the resulting sandwich after the location of the fair. However, Frank Menches's obituary in \"The New York Times\" stated, instead, that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.\n\nThe Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Charlie Nagreen, now known as \"Hamburger Charlie\", with the invention of the hamburger. Nagreen was 15 when he reportedly made sandwiches out of meatballs that he was selling at the 1885 Seymour Fair (now the Outagamie County Fair) to make it easier for customers to eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak, with which local German immigrants were familiar.\n\nThere is good evidence that the first hamburger served on a bun was made by Oscar Bilby of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1891.\n\nIn April 1995, the Dallas Morning News reported on an Oklahoma author who said that Tulsa beat out Texas as the birthplace of the delicacy. Michael Wallis, author of \"Route 66, The Mother Road\", was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he had discovered Tulsa's place in culinary history, which he made while researching the state’s tastiest hamburgers. He started at the restaurant that has been voted Tulsa's best burger more often than any other restaurant since 1933, Weber’s Root Beer Stand. Wallis’ research revealed that Oscar Weber Bilby was the first person to serve a real hamburger when, on July 4, 1891, ground beef was served on his wife’s homemade buns at a Fourth of July party on his farm, just west of present-day Tulsa. Until then, ground beef had been served in Athens, Texas, on simple slices of bread, known then and presently as a \"patty melt\". According to the Tulsa-based author, the bun is essential. Therefore, in 1995, Governor Frank Keating cited Athens, Texas' serving of ground beef between two slices of bread as a minor accomplishment. The governor's April 1995 proclamation also cites the first true hamburger on the bun, after meticulous research, was created and consumed in Tulsa in 1891. The Governor's Proclamation cites April 13, 1995, in Tulsa as \"The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger.\" \n\nThe Library of Congress credits Danish immigrant Louis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, with selling the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1895.\n\nThe hamburger bun was invented in 1916 by a fry cook named Walter Anderson, who co-founded White Castle in 1921.\n\nThe following restaurants have either played a part in the creation of the hamburger sandwich, developed a unique cooking method, or were the first to sell them nationwide:\n\n\nIn the United States, hamburgers may be classified into one of two primary categories: fast food hamburgers or individually prepared burgers made in homes and restaurants. The latter are traditionally prepared \"with everything\" (or \"all the way\", \"deluxe\", \"the works\", \"dragged through the garden\", or, in some regions, \"all dressed\"), which includes lettuce, tomato, onion, and sliced pickles (or pickle relish). Cheese (usually processed cheese slices, but often Cheddar, Swiss, pepper jack, or blue cheese), either melted on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is a popular option. In the Carolinas a time-honored popular style for hamburgers (and hot dogs) served in diners and homes (but not fast food chains) is \"all the way\" meaning mustard, slaw, chili and onions. \n\nCondiments may be added to the hamburger or offered separately on the side. The three most common condiments are mustard, mayonnaise, and ketchup. However, salad dressings and barbecue sauce are also popular. McDonald's uses their own \"Big Mac sauce\" on their signature Big Mac hamburger.\n\nOther popular toppings include bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, sliced green olives, sliced cheese sauce and/or chili (usually without beans). Heinz 57 sauce is popular among burger enthusiasts. Somewhat less common toppings include fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, salsa, pineapple, Jalapeños and other varieties of chile peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami, or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings, or potato chips.\n\nStandard toppings on hamburgers may vary depending upon location, particularly at restaurants that are not national or regional franchises. A \"Texas burger\" uses mustard as the only sauce, and comes with or without vegetables, jalapeno slices, and cheese. In New Mexico and parts of the Southwest, green chile burgers are very common. In the Upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin, burgers are often made with a buttered bun, butter as one of the ingredients of the patty, or with a pat of butter on top of the burger patty. This is called a \"Butter Burger\". In the Carolinas, a Carolina-style hamburger \"with everything\" may be served with cheese, chili, onions, mustard, and coleslaw. National hamburger chain Wendy's sells a \"Carolina Classic\" burger with these toppings in these areas. In Hawaii, hamburgers are often topped with teriyaki sauce, derived from the Japanese-American culture, and locally grown pineapple. The Waffle House claims on its menus and website to offer 70,778,880 different ways of serving a hamburger. In areas of the Midwest and East Coast, a hamburger served with lettuce, tomato, and onion is called a \"California burger\". This usage is sufficiently widespread to appear on the menus of Dairy Queen. In the Western U.S., a \"California\" burger often denotes a cheeseburger with guacamole and bacon added. Pastrami burgers are particularly popular in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nHamburgers may be described by their combined uncooked weight. A single, uncooked burger weighing a nominal four ounces or 113.5 grams is a \"quarter pounder\". Instead of a \"double hamburger\", one might encounter a third- or half-pounder, weighing eight ounces or 227 grams. Burger patties are nearly always specified in fractions of a pound.\n\nIn the continental U.S., it is uncommon to hear of a chicken patty or breast on a hamburger bun referred to as a \"chicken burger\". This is almost always called a \"chicken sandwich,\" except for rare exceptions, such as with the Red Robin chain of restaurants. In Canada, \"chicken burgers\" generally refer to patties and, when using a chicken breast, to \"chicken sandwiches\". In Hawaii, small (usually marinated) pieces of chicken piled on a bun are referred to as a teriyaki chicken burger. This is similar to what is found in Japan, but is a local variation.\n\n\n"}

In the book, a character named Hepzibah Pyncheon operates a little \"cent-shop\" which contained \"a glass pickle-jar, filled with fragments of Gibraltar rock; not, indeed, splinters of the veritable stone foundation of the famous fortress, but bits of delectable candy, neatly done up in white paper.\" His story \"The Old Apple-Dealer\", collected in \"Mosses from an Old Manse\", similarly mentions \"that delectable condiment, known by children as Gibraltar rock.\"\nNathaniel Hawthorne\n“The Old Apple-Dealer”:\n“Across [from him] extends a board, on which is displayed a plate of cakes and gingerbread, some russet and red-cheeked apples, and a box containing variegated sticks of candy, together with that delectable condiment known by children as Gibraltar rock, neatly done up in white paper.”\n\n\n"}

On the way to Daulatabad, the huge army of Tughlaq was exhausted. It was a difficult task to provide such a big army with food. So the \"shahi bawarchis\" (royal cooks) dug a hot furnace and rolled out thousands of naan.

It is commonly made in Aurangabad and specially in Weddings as well as on special occasions.\n\nThe naan are prepared in an open clay oven, which is mounted in a hole in the ground.

It consists of a mixture of partially digested rice grains floating in a sweet saccharified liquid, with small amounts of alcohol (1.5–2%) and lactic acid (0.5%). It is made by fermenting glutinous rice with a starter called Jiuqu (酒麴) containing \"Rhizopus oryzae\" and/or \"Aspergillus oryzae\" and often yeast and bacteria. \nIt was first developed as a by-product of \"mijiu\" production and generally speaking is partially digested and fermented rice from a young rice wine (or vinegar) ferment. If eaten quickly or held at 10 degrees or less which halts the fermentation, the product can be consumed as Jiuniang. If the temperatures are raised and fermentation continues, Jiuniang will eventually produce rice wine or rice vinegar. Jiuniang is most commonly made and consumed in the winter, where fermentation can be halted easily.\n\nOften jiuniang is translated to rice sauce or even rice wine (due to its alcohol content) by western Chinese retailers.

Naswar is stuffed in the floor of the mouth under the lower lip, or inside the cheek, for extended periods of time. It is similar to dipping tobacco and snus.\n\nNaswar was introduced into Western Europe by a Spanish monk named Ramon Pane after Columbus' second voyage to the Americas during 1493-1496. In 1561, Jean Nicot, the French ambassador in Lisbon, Portugal, sent naswar to Catherine de' Medici to treat her son's persistent migraine.\n\nThe green powder form is used most frequently. It is made by pouring water into a cement-lined cavity, to which slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and air-cured, sun-dried, powdered tobacco is added. Indigo is added to the mixture to impart color, and juniper ash may be added as flavoring. \n\nCurrently, the countries of the region freely sell naswar in the markets, usually on trays with cigarettes and sunflower seeds. The only exception is Turkmenistan, where in 2008 President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow signed a decree banning the production, sale, use, and import of naswar.\n\nIn 2011 naswar was included in the list of narcotic and psychoactive substances to be controlled in Kazakhstan.\n\nOn the territory of Russia, naswar is not a traditional product, but it gained popularity especially among teenagers. It was sold in the markets of Moscow and in other cities of the Urals, Volga, and other regions of the country. Its trade was usually conducted on trays with spices. According to the association of tobacco distributors \"Grandtabak\", in the first half of 2004, Russia's import of naswar or \"chewing tobacco\" amounted to almost 67 tons (total value of 16,500 US dollars), primarily from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. On 23 February 2013, the Russian State Duma signed a federal law (\"N 15-ФЗ\") which banned both wholesale and retail naswar from 1 June 2013 onward in Russia.\n\nOn the use of naswar Belarusian physicians reported and send patient's medical information to law enforcement agencies. In Estonia, naswar is being distributed to discothèques.\n\nThere are two forms of naswar; powder, and a paste cake style mixed with lime. It has a very pungent and powerful smell, resembling that of a fresh bale of coastal hay, and has a subtle flavor as it mixes with the saliva. The nicotine effect can occur within 5 minutes after intake, producing a slight burning sensation on the inner lip and tongue.\n\nSun and heat-dried tobacco leaves, slaked lime, ash from tree bark, and flavoring and coloring agents are mixed together. Water is added and the mixture is rolled into balls.\n\nNas: tobacco, ash, cotton or sesame oil, water, and sometimes gum.\n\nNaswar: tobacco, slaked lime, indigo, cardamom, oil, menthol, water.\n\nIn November 2006 an editorial in the newspaper \"Daily Times\" in Pakistan caused some controversy over its allegedly biased representations of Pashtun predilection for naswar.\n\nThe major side effect of using naswar is addiction, and it becomes difficult to get rid of it. It is also increasingly known that naswar often causes oral and throat cancer.\n\n\n"}

To accomplish this, the egg would have been emptied, with wax used to fill the hole and add some weight. When placed over a water jet from a fountain, the egg starts turning without falling, and thus \"dances.\" Generally, fountains with a dancing egg are also decorated with seasonal flowers and fresh fruits, like cherries, which cover the bowl of the fountain, as well as weaver's broom and carnations.\n\nFrom the Cathedral, the tradition also started at the patio of the neighboring Casa de l'Ardiaca (Archdeacon's House), and it spread to several other courtyards of the Barcelona city center beginning in the 1980s. More recently, other Catalan cities and towns assumed the tradition.\n\nIn Barcelona a dancing egg is placed in several locations within the Gothic Quarter during Corpus Christi: Barcelona Cathedral the Casa de l'Ardiaca, in addition to the courtyards of the Ateneu Barcelonès, the Archives of the Crown of Aragon (at the Lloctinent Palace), the Royal Academy of Arts of Barcelona, Frederic Marès Museum, the cloister of the Monastery of Jonqueres (adjacent to the Puríssima Concepció basilica), Centelles Palace, and the History Museum of Barcelona.\n\n\n\n"}

The name can also refer to a social event surrounding the meal.\n\nIn cooking booyah, one makes a base or broth derived from meat bones, to which vegetables are added. Beef, chicken, and pork are popular varieties of meat for booyah (with all three often in the same kettle), with vegetables such as carrots, peas, onion, and potatoes also in the mix. A wide variety of seasonings are used, sometimes lowered into the kettle in a cheesecloth bag. Typical large-scale booyah kettles can hold more than and are made from steel or cast iron to withstand direct heat and the hours (or days) of cooking. \n\nThe term \"booyah\" may be a variant of \"bouillon\".

{"id": "23370463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23370463", "title": "Kefir", "text": "Kefir\n\nKefir or kephir ( ), alternatively milk kefir (to distinguish it from water kefir), or búlgaros (in Latin America), is a fermented milk drink similar to a thin yoghurt that is made with a yeast and bacterial fermentation starter of kefir grains. The drink originated in Eastern Europe and Russia, where it is prepared by inoculating cow, goat, or sheep milk with kefir grains.\n\nThe word \"kefir\", known in Russian since at least 1867, is probably of Eastern European and Russian origin, although some sources see a connection to Turkic \"köpür\" (foam) or \"kef\" (a word of Persian origin meaning foam or bubbles). Traditional kefir was made in goatskin bags that were hung near a doorway; the bags would be knocked by anyone passing through to keep the milk and kefir grains well mixed. Kefir spread from the former Soviet Union to the rest of Europe, Japan, the United States by the early 21st century. It has become known in Latin America as \"búlgaros\", or \"Bulgarian drink\".\n\nIn Taiwan, researchers were able to produce kefir from yeasts and lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains. They report that the resulting kefir had similar chemical properties to homemade kefir. Despite this, it is still unclear how to reproduce exactly the complex microbiota found in kefir grains.\n\nTraditional kefir is fermented at ambient temperatures, generally overnight. Fermentation of the lactose yields a sour, carbonated, slightly alcoholic beverage, with a consistency and taste similar to thin yogurt.\n\nThe kefir grains initiating the fermentation are a combination of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in a matrix of proteins, lipids, and sugars. This symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (or SCOBY) forms \"grains\" that resemble cauliflower. A complex and highly variable community of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts can be found in these grains. While some microbes predominate, \"Lactobacillus\" species are always present. Even successive batches of kefir may differ due to factors such as the kefir grains rising out of the milk while fermenting or curds forming around the grains, as well as room temperature.\n\nKefir grains contain kefiran, a water-soluble polysaccharide, which imparts a creamy texture and feeling in the mouth. The grains range in color from white (the acceptable color of healthy grains) to yellow. The latter is the outcome of leaving the grains in the same milk during fermentation for longer than the optimal 24-hour period and continually doing so over many batches. Grains may grow to the size of walnuts or even larger.\n\nDuring fermentation, changes in the composition of ingredients occur. Lactose, the sugar present in milk, is broken down mostly to lactic acid (25%) by the lactic acid bacteria, which results in acidification of the product. Propionibacteria further break down some of the lactic acid into propionic acid (these bacteria also carry out the same fermentation in Swiss cheese). A portion of lactose is converted to kefiran, which is indigestible by gastric digestion. Other substances that contribute to the flavor of kefir are pyruvic acid, acetic acid, diacetyl and acetoin (both of which contribute a \"buttery\" flavor), citric acid, acetaldehyde, and amino acids resulting from protein breakdown.\n\nThe slow-acting yeasts, late in the fermentation process, break lactose down into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Depending on the process, ethanol concentration can be as high as 1–2% (achieved by small-scale dairies early in the 20th century), with the kefir having a bubbly appearance and carbonated taste. This makes kefir different from yogurt and most other sour milk products where only bacteria ferment the lactose into acids. Most modern processes, which use shorter fermentation times, result in much lower ethanol concentrations of 0.2–0.3%.\n\nAs a result of the fermentation, very little lactose remains in kefir. People with lactose intolerance are able to tolerate kefir, provided the number of live bacteria present in this beverage consumed is high enough (i.e., fermentation has proceeded for adequate time). It has also been shown that fermented milk products have a slower transit time than milk, which may further improve lactose digestion.\n\nFor the preparation of commercially-prepared kefir, so-called mild kefir, kefir grains are no longer used, but rather a powdered preparation of bacteria and yeast, allowing the flavor to be kept consistent.\n\nVariations that thrive in various other liquids exist, and vary markedly from kefir in both appearance and microbial composition. Water kefir (or \"tibicos\") is grown for a day or more at room temperature in water with sugar, sometimes with lemon juice and added dry fruit such as figs.\n\nKefir products contain nutrients in varying amounts from negligible to significant, including dietary minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, and conjugated linoleic acid, in amounts similar to unfermented cow, goat, or sheep milk. At a pH of 4.2 - 4.6, kefir is composed mainly of water and by-products of the fermentation process, including carbon dioxide and ethanol.\n\nTypical of milk, several dietary minerals are found in kefir, such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, copper, molybdenum, manganese, and zinc in amounts that have not been standardized to a reputable nutrient database. Also similar to milk, kefir contains vitamins in variable amounts, including vitamin A, vitamin B (thiamine), vitamin B (riboflavin), vitamin B (niacin), vitamin B (pyridoxine), vitamin B (folic acid), vitamin B (cyanocobalamin), vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Essential amino acids found in kefir include methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine, and valine, as for any milk product.\n\nProbiotic bacteria found in kefir products include: \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\", \"Bifidobacterium bifidum\", \"Streptococcus thermophilus\", \"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus\", \"Lactobacillus helveticus\", \"Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens\", \"Lactococcus lactis\", and \"Leuconostoc\" species. Lactobacilli in kefir may exist in concentrations varying from approximately 1 million to 1 \"billion\" colony-forming units per milliliter, and are the bacteria responsible for the synthesis of the polysaccharide \"kefiran\".\n\nIn addition to bacteria, kefir often contains strains of yeast that can metabolize lactose, such as \"Kluyveromyces marxianus\", \"Kluyveromyces lactis\", and \"Saccharomyces fragilis\", as well as strains of yeast that do not metabolize lactose, including \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", \"Torulaspora delbrueckii\", and \"Kazachstania unispora\". The nutritional significance of these strains is unknown.\n\nProduction of traditional kefir requires a starter community of kefir grains which are added to milk.\n\nThe traditional or artisanal method of making kefir is to add 2–10% kefir grains directly to milk in a sealed goatskin leather bag, which is traditionally agitated one or more times a day. Today the leather bag is replaced with a corrosion-resistant container such as a glass jar. It is not filled to capacity, allowing room for some expansion, as the carbon dioxide gas produced causes the liquid level to rise. Non-lightproof containers are stored in the dark to prevent degradation of light-sensitive vitamins. After a period of fermentation lasting around 24 hours, ideally at 20–25 °C (68–77 °F), the grains are strained from the liquid using a corrosion-resistant (stainless steel or plastic) utensil and kept as the starter for another batch.\n\nThe fermented liquid-kefir, which contains live micro-organisms from the grains, may be drunk, used in recipes, or kept aside in a sealed container for many days to undergo a slower secondary fermentation in which bio-synthesis by certain micro-organisms increases the content of folic acid and some other B vitamins, and the kefir becomes sourer. The shelf life, unrefrigerated, is up to thirty days. The grains enlarge in the process of kefir production and eventually split.\n\nThe Russian method permits production of kefir on a larger scale and uses two fermentations. The first step is to prepare the cultures by incubating milk with 2–3% grains as described. The grains are then removed by filtration and 1–3% of the resulting liquid mother culture is added to milk and fermented for 12 to 18 hours.\n\nKefir can be made using freeze-dried cultures commonly available in powder form from health food stores. A portion of the resulting kefir can be saved to be used a number of times to propagate further fermentations but ultimately does not form grains, so a fresh culture must be obtained.\n\nKefir grains will ferment the milk from most mammals and will continue to grow in such milk. Typical animal milks used include cow, goat, and sheep, each with varying organoleptic (flavor, aroma, and texture) and nutritional qualities. Raw milk has been traditionally used.\n\nKefir grains will also ferment milk substitutes such as soy milk, rice milk, nut milk and coconut milk, as well as other sugary liquids including fruit juice, coconut water, beer wort, and ginger beer. However, the kefir grains may cease growing if the medium used does not contain all the growth factors required by the bacteria.\n\nMilk sugar is not essential for the synthesis of the polysaccharide that makes up the grains (kefiran), and rice hydrolysate is a suitable alternative medium. Additionally, kefir grains will reproduce when fermenting soy milk, although they will change in appearance and size due to the differing proteins available to them.\n\nAs it contains \"Lactobacillus\" bacteria, kefir can be used to make a sourdough bread. It is also useful as a buttermilk substitute in baking. Kefir is one of the main ingredients in borscht in Lithuania, also known in Poland as \"Lithuanian cold soup\" (\"chłodnik litewski\"), and other countries. Kefir-based soup okroshka is common across the former Soviet Union. Kefir may be used in place of milk on cereal, granola, milkshakes, salad dressing, ice cream, smoothies and soup.\n\n\n\n"}

During the Prohibition period from 1920 to 1933, it was one of only 10 brands authorized for lawful production (for medicinal purposes).\n\nOld Forester is produced under the supervision of Master Distiller Chris Morris (as of 2006) at the Brown-Forman distillery in Shively, Kentucky (which is located directly adjacent to the pre-merger Southwest boundary of Louisville) using a mash bill of 72% corn (maize), 18% rye, and 10% malted barley (the same mash bill used for Woodford Reserve). Its mash bill has been described as \"pretty standard\" and \"richer in rye than most bourbons\".\n\nBottling variations include \"Old Forester Classic\" (86 proof / 43% abv, 4 years old), \"Old Forester Signature\" (100 proof / 50% abv), and \"Old Forester Birthday Bourbon\" (introduced in 2002, 95 proof / 47.5% abv in 2010 bottling).\n\nWhen the product was introduced in the 1870s, bottles of Old Forester were sealed as a way to guard against adulteration and substitution of the contents, and were initially sold in pharmacies as a medicinal product. The innovation introduced with Old Forester was not that it was available in such bottles, but that it was the first bourbon to be \"exclusively\" available in this fashion – providing a greater level of assurance of quality for that brand relative to other products in the market. This innovation was enabled and further fueled by emerging advances in the mass production of glass bottles, such as those soon to be developed by Michael Owens. The sealed bottle approach was popular with doctors and with the pharmacists that sold the product, and their approval was touted in advertisements of the product to the general public.\n\nOriginally, the product name was spelled \"Old Forrester\", with a double \"r\". The product is reported to have been named after a physician Dr. William Forrester who endorsed its consumption, and the renaming is conjectured to have been a way to avoid direct reference to the physician's name. Originally formed by George Garvin Brown and his half-brother John Thompson Street Brown (J.T.S. Brown, who would also later figure into the history of the Four Roses Distillery and inspire the naming of a brand of bourbon produced by Heaven Hill Distilleries), the company that produces the product was originally registered as J.T.S. Brown & Bro., and became Brown-Forman in 1902 after several partnerships and name changes involving partners James Thompson (who was also involved in the Glenmore Distillery Company and created the Old Thompson brand), Henry Chambers, and George Forman. George Garvin Brown became sole owner by 1902, and although Brown-Forman is now a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, the Brown family still controls more than 70% of the voting shares (as of 2010).\n\nTo produce his Old Forester product, Brown would initially purchase whiskies from distillers such as John Atherton and Ben Mattingly, and blend them together. In 1902, he then purchased Mattingly's distillery in the town of Saint Mary in Marion County, Kentucky.\n\nUntil Prohibition in the United States began in 1920, Old Forester was the leading brand produced by Brown's company. Since then, other brands acquired later by the company, such as Early Times (purchased in 1923, which became America's best-selling bourbon and maintained high sales for 30 years), and Jack Daniel's (purchased in 1956 and as of 2007 the best-selling whiskey of any kind in the world), have become its leading products.\n\nIn August 2016, Old Forester announced the release of its 115-proof 1920 Prohibition Style bourbon.\n\nSome awards and recognitions for the brand include the following:\n\n\"Wine Enthusiast\" described Old Forester as having \"a very spicy nose that has some sweet vanilla peeking through\".\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy said \"The sweet-and-sour aroma will be the first thing you notice about this venerable Kentucky classic.\"\n"}

But R-parity prevents a direct decay to quarks and/or gluons, and on the other hand the only other colored supersymmetric particles are the squarks, that being bosons (spin 0, being the partners of the spin 1/2 quarks) have a much higher mass in Split SUSY.\n\nAll this, together, implies that the decay of the gluino can only go through a virtual particle, a high-mass squark. The mean decay time depends on the mass of the intermediate virtual particle, and in this case can be very long.\nThis gives a unique opportunity to observe a SUSY particle directly, in a particle detector, instead of deducing it by reconstructing its decay chain or by the momentum imbalance (as in the case of the LSP).\n\nIn other theories belonging to the SUSY family, the same role can be played by the lightest squark (usually the \"stop\", i.e. the partner of the top quark). \n\nIn the following, for sake of illustration, the R-hadron will be assumed to originate from a gluino created in a formula_1 collision at LHC, but the observational features are completely general.\n\nSince some of the sub-detectors of a typical high-energy experiment are only sensitive to charged particles, one possible signature is the disappearance of the particle (going from charge +1 or -1 to 0) or vice versa its appearance, while keeping the same trajectory (since most of the momentum is carried by the heaviest component, i.e. the supersymmetric particle inside the R-hadron). \nAnother signature with very little background would come from the complete inversion of the charge (+1 into -1 or vice versa). Almost all tracking detectors at high-energy colliders make use of a magnetic field and are then able to identify the charge of the particle by its curvature; a change of curvature along the trajectory would be recognized unambiguously as a \"flipper\", i.e. a particle whose charge has flipped.\n\n"}

This is for a purely practical reason: bamboo will not grow fast enough in a cold area and the joints are too close together, whereas in a warm area the bamboo grows too fast and the joints are too far apart. So the Kanto area has a moderate climate which makes the joints the perfect distance apart. The joints of your shaft help with the balance.

When it has aged the proper time the bamboo should provide a good tight grip around the tang of the yanone.

It consists of \"a continuous meandering line on an imagined grid to produce a graceful, often symmetrical, composition of geometric patterns\". The artist's implement is a single finger.\n\nUNESCO describes sand drawing as:\nArtists such as Pablo Picasso were known for drafting their visual ideas in the sand. Norman Joseph Woodland, inventor of the barcode, came up with his invention by drawing it in the sand.\n\nSand drawings are associated with the Indian sand mandalas because of the geometry-driven shapes it delivers through the manipulation of sand. The work of making patterns in the sand with a rake is also evocative of the Karesansui practice in tradition Japan rock gardens, and of the large scale Nazca Lines in Peru.\n\nSince the traditional art of sand drawing is so precisely geometrical, academic research is being led to associate the (ethno-) mathematical patterns held in this art, and correlate it with modern mathematics to get a sense of the potential scientific knowledge carried by the builders of the civilizations practicing it. The ancient Greek mathematician studying geometry by drawing figures in the sand also leads to the idea that traditional Sandroings convey much more than a pleasing visual effect.\n\nThe Vanuatu Cultural Centre has noted that the spirit of sand drawing tends to disappear, only a few practitioners still master the special techniques of sand drawing. Nowadays, this form of art is mainly used as a graphic layout for advertising or tourism ends, and its original sense and purpose is getting lost. A National Action Plan for the Safeguarding of Sand Drawing has been initiated by the Centre, together with the Save Sand Drawings Action Committee; the programme is sponsored by UNESCO. The project notably led to a National Sand Drawing Festival, as from 2004.\n\nThe Turaga indigenous movement based on Pentecost Island write using Avoiuli, an alphabet inspired by designs found in traditional sand drawings. Sand drawing is interpreted as a key visual medium in a country where more than 100 languages are spoken.\n\nIn the Pitjantjatjara dialect of North Central Australia, the word \"Milpatjunanyi\" means \"the art of telling stories in the sand\".

The pudding is a culinary specialty from Lower Saxony in north Germany. It was created by a Hanoverian chef and served for the first time at the 200th anniversary of the rule of the House of Welf.

In some cases, garden sharing projects are launched as a way to shorten community garden waiting lists that are common in many cities.\n\nGarden sharing arrangements take two main forms. The simplest is an agreement between two parties: one supplies the land, the other supplies the labour, and the proceeds are shared. In larger collaborations, groups, often neighbours, share garden spaces, labour and the harvest.\n\nThe specifics addressed by a garden sharing agreement are potentially numerous, and the contract itself may be simple or exhaustive. Issues to be considered include terms of access, acceptable behavior, and who supplies what as far as gardening equipment and supplies. At one end of the scale, a verbal arrangement may be all that is expected. However, garden sharing organisations often suggest a written agreement and supply sample contracts. Organisers may also interview participants before suggesting a match.\n\nThe Web is frequently used as a platform for initiating garden sharing arrangements. Web sites connecting landowners and growers are generally free and non-commercial. Web sites are instituted by a variety of parties, including private individuals, government agencies, and non-profit groups.\n\nA number of local, regional and national programs exist across the U.S. and Canada, including:\n\n\nIn the UK, Landshare is a high-profile national garden sharing project in England, spearheaded by celebrity chef and TV personality Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, in conjunction with public-service broadcaster Channel 4. Growers, landowners and volunteers can, at no charge, register their interest in participating in a share in their area. There are over 40,000 members. Although this is a number that have registered since 2009 when the social enterprise was first publicized widely, since then its activity has decreased. Scotland, has only one project, a charity called Edinburgh Garden Partners which has over 60 gardens throughout the city shared by volunteers. The charity aims to promote locally grown food and the skills of doing so with supporting older and disabled people who can no longer manage their garden.\n\nIn France, Prêter son jardin (\"Garden lending\") is a garden sharing web site started by a journalist in 2010.\n\nGarden sharing projects are also incorporated into larger sustainability schemes. Transition Town Totnes (Totnes, England) and Transition Timaru (Timaru, NZ) have instituted garden sharing projects as part of their Transition Towns efforts to prepare communities on a local level for the effects of climate change and peak oil.\n\n"}

At the time of introduction, Sunkist Soft Drinks had only five key employees: Mark Stevens, President; Peter Murphy, VP Sales; Dr. John Leffingwell, VP R&D; Ray Sissom, VP Finance; and Jim DeDreu, NE Regional Manager.

The advertising slogan was \"fun, sun and the beach\" using TV and radio commercials with the Beach Boys' hit song \"Good Vibrations\" as the brand's theme.

At present, although they are typical on Christmas, they can sometimes be eaten during the rest of the year, for example with \"crema catalana\" or ice creams.\n\nThe noun \"neula\" comes from Latin \"nebula\", that means \"fog\", because of its fine and light texture. Some documents show that neules exist before \"torró\", being \"torró\" shown to exist at least in the Middle Ages and eaten, for example, at Jaume I's daughter wedding.\n\nMaking neules at home, because of their lightness and slimness, is not easy so they are usually bought by Catalans in professional patisseries. Nevertheless, some people do make them.\n\nIn Belgium there are \"gaufres\" that, even if they are very much thicker and plate, have the same origin as \"neules\". The same origin have other some stuffed or not waffles, as Dutch \"stroopwafels\". In other regions of Spain there are a sort of rolled biscuits called \"barquillos\", but they are very much stronger, harder and thicker than waffles and \"neules\", bigger than \"neules\" and they taste different.\n\n"}
{"id": "23701322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23701322", "title": "Stauros", "text": "Stauros\n\nStauros () is a Greek word which in the oldest forms (Homeric and classical Greek) (until the fourth century BC) is found used in the plural number in the sense of an upright stake or pole. In Koine Greek, in use during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, within which the New Testament was written, it was used in the singular number with reference to an instrument of capital punishment; in modern Greek it is used to refer only to a cross, real or metaphorical.\n\nThe word \"stauros\" comes from the verb ἵστημι (\"histēmi\": \"straighten up\", \"stand\"), which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *\"steh-u-\" \"pole\", related to the root *\"steh-\" \"to stand, to set\" (the same root is found in German \"Stern\", or \"Stamm\", the English \"stand\", the Spanish word \"estaca\", the Portuguese word \"estaca\", the Polish \"stać\", the Italian \"stare\", of similar meanings).\n\nIn Homeric and classical Greek, until the early 4th century BC, \"stauros\" meant an upright stake, pole, or piece of paling, \"on which anything might be hung, or which might be used in impaling [fencing in] a piece of ground.\"\n\nIn the literature of that time, it never means two pieces of timber placed across one another at any angle, but always one piece alone, and is always used in the plural number, never in the singular.\n\nIn Koine Greek, the form of Greek in use between about 300 BC and AD 300, the word σταυρός was used to denote a wooden object on which Romans executed criminals. When the word is thus employed in the writings of the Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), Plutarch and Lucian – non-Christian writers, of whom only Lucian makes clear the shape of the device – the authoritative \"A Greek–English Lexicon\" translates it as \"cross\". According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", this form of capital punishment involved binding the victim with outstretched arms to a crossbeam, or nailing him firmly to it through the wrists; the crossbeam was then raised against an upright shaft and made fast to it about 3 metres from the ground, and the feet were tightly bound or nailed to the upright shaft. Speaking specifically about the σταυρός of Jesus, early Christian writers unanimously suppose it to have had a crossbeam. Thus Justin Martyr said it was prefigured in the Jewish Passover lamb:\n\nIn \"A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to The English and Greek New Testament\" (1877), hyperdispensationalist E. W. Bullinger, in contrast to other authorities, stated:\n\nA similar view was put forward by John Denham Parsons in 1896. Bullinger's 1877 statement and that of Parsons in 1896, written before the discovery of thousands of manuscripts in Koine Greek at Oxyrhyncus in Egypt revolutionised understanding of the language of the New Testament, conflict with the documented fact that, long before the end of the fourth century, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135, and may have been of the 1st century AD, the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened the σταυρός to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), and to the position assumed by Moses in Exodus . The shape of the σταυρός is likened to that of the letter T also in the final words of \"Trial in the Court of Vowels\" among the works of 2nd-century Lucian, and other 2nd-century witnesses to the fact that at that time the σταυρός was envisaged as being cross-shaped and not in the form of a simple pole are given in early Christian descriptions of the execution cross.\n\nIn modern Greek the word σταυρός means:\n\nTo render the English terms \"stake\" and \"pole\", modern Greek employs not σταυρός but παλούκι and πάσσαλος.\n\n"}

The Hindus in West Bengal mostly belong to the shakta and a small community belong to Vaishnavite and Shaivite denominations. The vast majority of Hindus in West Bengal are Bengali Hindus, but a notable section of non-Bengali Hindus also exist, particularly among Marwaris, Biharis, Odias, Gurkhas and various tribal communities.\n\nHinduism had existed in the region of Bengal before the 16th century BC and by the 3rd century, Buddhism and Jainism were popular too. Gaur, the first sovereign Hindu kingdom in Bengal with its capital in Karnasubarna in modern-day Murshidabad district, was set up by Shashanka, a Shaivaite king who ruled approximately between 600 AD and 625 AD. The modern structure of Bengali Hindu society was developed during the rule of the Sena dynasty in the 12th century AD. West Bengal has been home to several famous religious teachers, including Sri Chaitanya, Sri Ramakrishna, Rammohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda who helped to abolish archaic practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or untouchability that crept into the Hindu society during the Middle Ages. But they also played an important role in the resurgence of Hindu nationalism in Bengal. This inherent Hindu identity was the chief factor in Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement which successfully resisted the plan to create a United Bengal and campaigned for the establishing a separate state of West Bengal in India on the eve of Partition of India in 1947.\n\nThe language of the Hindus in West Bengal is Bengali. A large number of Hindu religious texts like biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Mangal-kavyas, Bratakathas and Panchalis as well as dharmik writings of modern Bengali philosophers and saints have been produced in Bengali for many centuries.\n\nKali and Chandi are the most worshipped Hindu goddesses in West Bengal. Worship of Durga, Kali, Shiva, Krishna and other gods and goddesses is also common. Durga Puja is the biggest and most important festival of the Hindus in West Bengal as well as the most significant festival of the state in general. Kali Puja is the second major festival of the community and it corresponds to the pan-Indian festival of Diwali. Other major festivals include Kojagari Lakshmi Puja, Dolyatra, Jagaddhatri Puja, Rathayatra, Saraswati Puja, Poila Baishakh, Vishwakarma Puja, Gajan, Poush Parban etc.\n\nBengali Hindus in West Bengal observe a number of festivals, hence the Bengali proverb \"Baro Mase Tero Parbon\" (, \"thirteen festivals in twelve months\").Birth Anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore which is celebrated as one of the major festivals of the state, Rathyatra and Janmashtami before the commencement of the autumnal festival season which starts with Vishwakarma Puja on the last day of Bengali month of Bhadra. The annual five-day Durga Puja is the biggest and most widely celebrated Hindu festival in West Bengal. Durga Puja is followed by Kojagari Lakshmi Puja, Kali Puja, Bhai Phonta, Jagaddhatri Puja and Kartik Puja. On 1 January Kalpataru Day is observed as an auspicious day associated with Ramakrishna Paramhansa. The winter solstice is celebrated a Paush Sankranti in mid January, followed by \"Netaji Jayanti\" or the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Saraswati Puja. The spring festival of Holi is celebrated in the form of Dolyatra. The year ends with Charak Puja and Gajan.\n\nTemple architecture in West bengal architecture has assumed a unique identity and evolved into the Bengali terra cotta temple architecture which is also a very common style of Hindu temples in Bangladesh. Due to lack of suitable stone in the alluvial Gangetic delta, the temple makers had to resort to other materials instead of stone. This gave rise to using terra cotta as a medium for temple construction. Terra-cotta exteriors with rich carvings are a unique feature of Bengali temples. The town of Vishnupur in West Bengal is renowned for this type of architecture.\n\nUsually a part of the intended total motif was carved by hand on one side of a brick and then baked. While under construction, these carved bricks were arranged to make up the entire motif.\n\nThe Bengali style of temple is not luxurious. Rather, most are modeled on simple thatched-roof earthen huts used as dwellings by commoners. This can be attributed to the popularity of bhakti cults which taught people to view gods as close to themselves. Thus, various styles like \"do-chala\", \"jor-bangla\", \"char-chala\", and \"aat-chala\" sprang up. However, there is also a popular style of building known as Navaratna (nine-towered) or Pancharatna (five-towered) in Bengal which is more luxurious than the Chala buildings. A typical example of Navaratna style is the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. The Shiva temples of rural Bengal has significantly impacted on the architectural style of Kalighat Temple, one of the oldest Hindu temples of India. The famous Birla Temple of Kolkata, built in 1996, has a unique blend of temple architecture of Odisha with Rajasthani temple arts. The Mahakal Temple in Darjeeling is an unique and important hindu temple since 1782.\n\nThe Bengali Hindus of West Bengal have their mainstay in trade and business. This ethnic minority has been home to major industrialists worldwide. Large number of West Bengali Hindus have settled outside India. However, the largest section of urban middle and upper-middle class Hindus are employed in the service sector and numerous professional fields like law, medicine, academics, engineering, journalism, liberal arts, corporate job, banking etc. On the other hand, most of the rural and semi-rural people are engaged in agriculture, cottage industry and small-scale businesses.\n\nThe literacy level of Bengali Hindus in Bengal and other parts of the world is very high. The higher literacy level combined with economic prosperity and flexible outlook have given Bengali Hindus in West Bengal a clear edge over other communities, especially Muslims .\n\nNoted West Bengali Hindu industrialists include:\n\n"}

It is made out of rice pudding mixed with whipped cream, vanilla, and chopped almonds; and is usually served cold with a cherry sauce (\"kirsebærsovs\").\n\nIt gained popularity when rice pudding became more common. Until then rice pudding had been a very exclusive dish, as making it required two expensive, imported ingredients: rice and cinnamon. After World War II, risalamande experienced an increase in popularity, being touted as a \"savings\" dessert: adding whipped cream (which was easily available) to the still fairly expensive rice would make the rice last longer. In order to minimize costs, risalamande was frequently made without almonds during this time, too.\n\nA similar traditional Danish Christmas dish, risengrød, is essentially risalamande before the whipped cream, vanilla, and almonds have been added, and is typically served hot, topped with cinnamon and butter.\n\nNowadays, it is very common to make a large batch of rice pudding for dinner on \"lillejuleaften\" (\"Little Christmas Eve\", i.e. December 23), a part of which is kept until Christmas Eve and used to make risalamande, which is eaten as dessert after the big Christmas dinner.\n\nNormally, a whole almond is added to the dessert, and the person who finds it wins a small prize—such as a chocolate heart, a marzipan pig, or a small board game. Part of the game involves the finder concealing their discovery as long as possible, so that the rest of the company is forced to eat the entire dish of risalamande, even after they have already devoured a large Christmas dinner.\n\nIn Sweden, this dish is called \"ris à la Malta\", which is a corruption of the Danish name. Typically it's made of chilled leftover rice pudding, whipped cream, sugar and vanilla, with or without almonds. By tradition, the person finding a hidden almond in the dessert is expected to get married before the next Christmas. A variety containing diced oranges is called \"apelsinris\". The dish is mostly served with either a smooth cordial-sauce, jam or semi-thawed frozen berries. A commercially sold snack, similar to Ris à la Malta, is sold under the name \"Risifrutti\" since 1993.\n\nNorwegians have a similar dish called \"riskrem\" (“rice cream”) and, as in Denmark, the person finding a hidden almond in the dessert wins a \"mandelgave\" (almond-gift) in the form of a marzipan pig or the like. The desert may contain almonds for flavour, but mostly chopped on top as decoration. In Norway, the sauce is also normally made of raspberry (or even strawberry) rather than cherry.\n\n"}

It is also found in Turkish cuisine and is called \"erişte\" in modern standard Turkish. The word itself is a nominalisation of the verb \"to cut\" or \"to slice\", referring to the slicing of the dough involved in preparing the noodles. The term may refer to the noodles themselves, or the prepared dish made with them. Kesme is traditionally a homemade dish, and not often found at restaurants or cafés. In Turkey, kesme is known as \"erişte\", and eaten generally in winter. It is made from flour, egg, water, salt and milk. These ingredients are worked into a dough, which is rolled out, cut, and dried in the sun or an oven after dried for a day.\n\nThe dough for kesme usually consists of flour, water, salt, and an egg. The dough is rolled out into a large thin circle, and left to dry for a while. It is then lightly floured, folded over several times accordion-style, and sliced into strips, which are then separated. The process has been illustrated, step by step. The kesme may be boiled immediately in a broth often containing ingredients such as potatoes, meat, carrots, peppers, and tomatoes, or left to harden and stored. Kesme is often made in a kazan.\n\nReshteh () or Reshte are Persian whole wheat noodles, traditionally the noodle would be a homemade item. The reshteh used in the Iranian cuisine can be a thicker, whole wheat noodle used in \"reshteh polow\" (rice and noodle pilaf dish) and in \"ash reshteh\". \"\"Reshteh\"\" was the only word for noodles in Arab cookbooks of the 13th and 14th centuries. A recipe substitution for reshteh noodles, is often linguine or whole-wheat noodles.\n\nSpecial symbolism is given to dishes that contain noodles when a decision of importance or change is to occur; the noodles or \"reins\" of one's life are to be taken in hand. A traditional dish in Iran is \"reshteh polow\", which is served during the Persian new year with the noodles representing the threads of life and family intertwined.

{"id": "23912042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23912042", "title": "Leblon Cachaça", "text": "Leblon Cachaça\n\nLeblon Cachaça is a premium artisanal brand of the spirit cachaça (pronounced ka-SHA-sa) produced at the Destilaria Maison Leblon in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil. Cachaça is the key ingredient to the caipirinha (pronounced kai-pur-EEN-ya), Brazil’s national cocktail.\n\nLeblon was first introduced to the US and Brazil in September 2005 and was subsequently introduced to markets in Europe in 2006. Currently Leblon is available in Brazil, the United States, Canada, Europe, and a few markets in Asia.\n\nThe company has seen steady growth since 2005.\n\nLeblon Cachaça was a Gold Medal Award Winner at the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 \"San Francisco World Spirits Competition\", a nine-consecutive-year run, which is a first for any cachaça. (In 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, & 2013 Leblon was awarded the Double Gold Medal for Best Cachaça.) It was also the Best in Class Winner at the 2007 \"International Tasting Competition\" in London and was awarded the 2010 Rising Star Growth Brand Award. It also won Sounds and Colours' favourite cachaça in their Caipirinha Challenge in 2011.\n\nLeblon is produced at its own vertically integrated distillery in the fertile cachaça-producing Minas Gerais region of Brazil. The distillery is called \"Maison Leblon\", and Gilles Merlet, along with Carlos Oliveira, serves as master distiller. Merlet approaches the distillation of Leblon Cachaça as if it were a fine wine. The cane is hand-harvested from Leblon's nearby fields and quickly delivered to the Maison for pressing. The juice is fermented for 20 to 24 hours before being transferred into the Alambique copper pot stills for single-batch distillation. The distillate is then rested up to 6 months in Vintage XO Cognac Casks from France. The various batches are then master blended, and the final batch is gently filtered and bottled in glass. Since Leblon Cachaça is distilled in Alambique copper pot stills in smaller batches and not in faster, cheaper column stills, it is classified as an \"artisanal\" cachaça. Leblon is certified by the Instituto Mineiro de Agropecuária as an artisanal Cachaça de Alambique.\n\nMaison Leblon is committed to minimizing waste, reducing energy needs, and preserving the environment. In the sugar cane fields, all leaves and discarded sugar cane tops are provided to local farmers for livestock feed. \"Bagaço,\" which is the exhausted sugar cane after pressing, is used to heat the water running through the copper coils in the alambique potstills for full self-sufficient distillation. \"Vinhaça,\" which is the residual liquid after distillation, is isolated to a pond on the distillery property, where it is allowed to breakdown naturally. It is also added as a natural fertilizer to the sugar cane field along with any excess bagaço not used for heating the pot stills.\n\nDespite the fact that cachaça is the official spirit of Brazil and the third-most consumed spirit in the world, it has not been recognized in some countries as a unique product appellation from Brazil. Until 2013, cachaça sold in the United States was required to say \"rum\" somewhere on the front label. Many makers, including Leblon, referred to their product as Brazilian Rum on the label. Cachaça is made from fresh cane juice, not molasses like rum, predates the invention of rum by over a century (a.c. 1550), and has an entirely different cultural connotation.\n\nIn 2013, Leblon created a movement to 'Legalize Cachaça.' The Legalize Cachaça campaign targeted bartenders, the trade, consumers and the press with the purpose of educating the masses about the distinctions between cachaça and rum. The campaign also lobbied the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to recognize cachaça as a class or type of distilled spirit under the authority of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.\n\nOn February 25, 2013, the U.S. Alcohol Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) finally “legalized cachaça,” as they published the final rule that recognized Brazil’s national spirit as an official spirit and distinctive product of Brazil. The final rule went into effect on April 11, 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24025135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24025135", "title": "Game pie", "text": "Game pie\n\nGame pie is a form of meat pie featuring game. The dish dates from Roman times when the main ingredients were wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer, and hare. The pies reached their most elaborate form in Victorian England, with complex recipes and specialized moulds and serving dishes. Modern versions are simpler but savoury combinations of rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other commercially available game.\n\nGame pies were consumed by the wealthy in the days of the Roman Empire. Wilhelm Adolf Becker states that the emperor Augustus consumed pies that contained chicken, pheasants, pigeon, and duck.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, \"bake mete\" described a pie in which meat or fish is baked with fruit, spices, etc. The meats and sauces were placed in a tough and inedible pastry shell, or \"coffin\" with a lid sealed on, then baked. There was no pan: the pie shell itself acted as the container. Frequently the pastry was considered superfluous and was discarded. The process of raising the sides of the pie to form a strong protective crust is described in old cookery books as \"raising the coffin\".\nThe term \"mete\" referred to the pie, not the meat: a 15th-century cookbook gives a bake mete recipe for a pear custard pie.\n\nDescribing the franklin in the 14th-century classic \"The Canterbury Tales\", Chaucer said: \"\"Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentvous\"\". The best meat might be reserved for the wealthy, while their servants ate inferior pies made of the left-over \"umbles\" – liver, heart, tripes, and other offal, hence the term \"eating humble pie\".\n\nIn medieval times, birds that might be found in a game pie included heron, crane, crow, swan, stork, cormorant, and bittern as well as smaller birds trapped by nets such as thrushes, starlings, and blackbirds. The 15th-century cookery book \"Un Vyaunde furnez sanz nom de chare\" describes a croustade of veal, herbs, dates, and eggs baked in a coffin, but other sources describe croustades of chicken and pigeon. Birds were often placed on top of game pies as ornaments, or 'subtelties', a practice that continued into the Victorian age. An 1890s edition of \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" shows a game pie topped by a stuffed pheasant.\n\nThrough most of the period of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs, roughly from 1500 to 1685, it was common for the rulers and their courtiers to stage elaborate feasts where the attraction was as much the entertainment provided by musicians, comedians, jugglers and acrobats as the food itself. Sometimes the two were combined. Around 1630, at a dinner attended by Charles I, a huge game pie was placed on the table. But when the crust was removed, a dwarf armed with sword and buckler sprang from the coffin. On another occasion, the king was served a surprise pie containing live birds, perhaps the origin of the rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\".\n\nThe game pies of that period were sweeter than in later times, often containing fruit as well as meat, game and spices.\nThe Tudor Christmas Pie was a rich pie of traditional birds such as partridge, chicken and goose with a recent addition, the turkey, which had been introduced to England from the New World in 1523.\nGame pie was not restricted to the rich.\nUntil the 1816 Gaming act, country people had the right to catch small game such as rabbits and pigeons to supplement their diet.\nMore valuable game were reserved for the rich, but perhaps not entirely successfully. Shakespeare in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" alludes to a Venison pasty made from \"ill-killed\" deer.\n\nIn 1653 François Pierre La Varenne published his groundbreaking work \"Le Pâtissier françois\". On the frontispiece is a country kitchen where the cook is making a game pie surrounded by the dead game that would have been included. The \"Oreiller de la Belle Aurore\" is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite dishes, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and much else, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of gastronomy, the Larousse Gastronomique.\n\nIn the 18th century, game pies prepared for the prosperous gentry could be very elaborate. Hannah Glasse, in her best-selling \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\", first published in 1747, gave a recipe for a Christmas pie that included pigeon, partridge, a chicken and a goose, all boned and placed one inside the other, and then placed within an enormous turkey. In his 1816 autobiography William Hutton recalls of his maternal grandmother:\n\nShe was a careful yet liberal housekeeper, and well skilled in cookery, pastry, and confectionery. I have heard of a pie she raised in the form of a goose trussed for the spit; the real goose was boned; a duck was boned and laid within it; a fowl was boned and laid within the duck; a boned partridge within the fowl; and a boned pigeon within the partridge. The whole having been properly seasoned, the interstices were filled with rich gravy.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli in his novel \"Venetia\" describes an English dinner around 1770 that included ...that masterpiece of the culinary art, a great battalia pie, in which the bodies of chickens, pigeons, and rabbits, were embalmed in spices, cock's combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs ... [on] the cover of this pastry ... the curious cook had contrived to represent all the once-living forms that were now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre.\n\nAt some point, it became customary for game pies to be served cold. An enormous game pie was made for the Earl of Sefton in the first part of the 19th century to be presented to the corporation of Liverpool. It contained a great variety of game, stuffed one bird within another, as well as truffles, veal, bacon and other ingredients. The meats were first cooked, then cooled with ice and placed in a huge pastry shell with a crust, which was further cooked for three hours. After pouring a hot aspic sauce into the pie through a funnel, it was allowed to cool again for two days before being served cold. The 1845 cookbook \"The practical cook, English and foreign\" describes similar game pies of chickens, pigeons, partridges, hares, rabbits, pheasants, gray plovers, grouse, wild fowls or small birds, which may have slices of ham added. With all of these, calf's foot jelly or the bone of a knuckle of veal stewed down to a jelly was added to form aspic when the pie was cooled. The cold pie would then be sliced and served in the same way as its relative, the modern pork pie.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, potters such as Josiah Wedgwood introduced industrial processes that made it practical to mass-produce glazed pottery containers capable of withstanding the heat of the oven, at relatively low prices. Following a suggestion by Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1786, Wedgwood started making game pie dishes with an inner liner to hold the contents and an ornamental cover. These were a useful alternative to the traditional pastry coffin, since there were endemic shortages of wheat at this time caused by the early industrial revolution coupled with the disruption of trade during the Napoleonic wars\nWedgwood's dishes often had raised bas-relief ornaments of dead game and vine leaves, and a lid handle often modeled on a hare or root vegetable. Some designs gave the illusion of a pastry coffin and lid. William Jesse in his 1844 biography of Beau Brummel says this design was introduced in 1800 when the royal household prohibited the use of flour for pastry in their kitchens, using rice instead.\n\nThe invention of the sprung metal pie form made it possible to use a finer pastry than the old-fashioned hot water crust pastry, and also to impart much finer decorative detail to the surface of the pastry. The moulds were sold in many different designs. The potter Herbert Minton introduced Majolica wares in 1851, earthenware ceramics decorated with relief figures and brilliant glazes. Until not long before, only the aristocracy and the gentry had had the right to consume game and there were still many restrictions. Expensive Majolica game pie dishes, draped with images of sumptuous game animals, were used by aspiring middle-class families to signal that they had the wealth or connections to obtain the game that they served to their guests legally rather than through the black market.\n\nAs the Victorian age advanced, the middle classes grew rapidly, with aspirations to a lifestyle that had been reserved to the privileged few. Pioneers such as Alexis Soyer introduced new cooking techniques for the masses based on scientific principles and gas ovens.\nMrs. Beeton addressed a broad audience in her 1861 \"Book of Household Management\", giving simple recipes for grouse and partridge pie and for preparing other common game such as wild duck, hare, corn-crake, pheasant, plovers, ptarmigan, quail, venison, etc.\n\nThe game pie gradually waned in snob appeal and popularity. In \"The Mating Season\", P.G. Wodehouse notes that Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright once hit the game pie at the Drones six times with six consecutive bread rolls from a seat at the far window.\nIn \"Vile Bodies\", a novel about the period between the first and second world wars, Evelyn Waugh describes the game pie at Shepheard's, a fictional club, as \"quite black inside and full of beaks and shot and inexplicable vertebrae\".\n\nMany restaurants today serve game pies and there are many modern recipes, but they are usually quite different from the traditional cold game pie. Commonly they contain a savoury stew of commercially available meats such as rabbit and venison, quail and pheasant, but not birds such as pigeons, thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, and crows that were commonly used in the past. They are usually served hot, and may have no shell but only a pastry cover – or in restaurants only a puff-pastry lid added at the last minute.\n\n\n"}

It consists only of puff pastry with no filling or other ingredients. Despite its name, it is not blue.\n\nBlue cake has been produced by Frutig valley bakeries since at least the 1900s. Up until the 1950s, however, it was only sold in colder months, when butter could be kept cold more easily, and around major holidays. As of 2000, the cake is available on weekends around the year in most bakeries, where it is one of the most important weekend pastries.\n\nDespite its name, the cake is not actually blue, and some Frutig valley bakers who were interviewed by Swiss culinary historians in the 2000s provided different explanations for the name. One such explanation was that, in the local dialect, \"to make blue\" (\"blau machen\") means to take a holiday. Other bakers believe that the name refers to the faint blue tint of the uncooked dough or to the blueish, buttery steam emerging from the oven in which the cake is baked.\n\nBlue cake is made only by professional bakers from a dough of flour, butter, water and salt. Several layers of butter are rolled into the dough with a special rolling machine (\"tourage\"), after which the dough is cut into roundels of pastry 6 cm thick and 25 cm or more in diameter. These are cut with decorative patterns, brushed with eggs and baked at 220 °C for 20 minutes.\n\nThe mostly orally transmitted recipes differ among local bakers, who as of the 2000s are producing the cake in the third or fourth generation. The amount of butter used, the time during which the dough is allowed to rest before baking (up to two days) and the baking temperature and heat all vary.\n\nBlue cake is eaten as a snack with cheese and meat or at breakfast with coffee, butter and jam. It has a light and buttery taste.\n\nThe cake is mostly appreciated by Frutig Valley residents and is virtually unknown among visitors and outside the valley.\n\n"}

Though more often, and originally only applied to males, it can be used equally for males and females; although women would more commonly use another slang word to refer to another unnamed female person, such as \"\"chava\"\" (young woman) or \"\"vieja\"\" (old lady). It is used roughly the same way \"dude\" is used in modern American English. It is derived from the term \"buey\", which refers to an ox, used for meat, sacrifice, or labor. It was used to insult men because oxen are slow, castrated bulls. Over time, the initial underwent a consonant mutation to a , often elided; resulting in the modern \"wey\". The word can be used as an insult, like \"fool\", although, due to its extremely high frequency of use in a multitude of contexts, it has lost much of its offensive character, becoming a colloquialism.\n\nIt is common to use both meanings of the term interchangeably:\n\n\nIn the first case, it is used like the English profanity, \"dumbass\".

{"id": "24080194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24080194", "title": "Maple liqueur", "text": "Maple liqueur\n\nMaple liqueur refers to various alcoholic products made from maple syrup, primarily in the Northeast United States and Canada. It is most commonly made by mixing Canadian rye whiskey and Canadian maple syrup. Maple liqueur is considered an important cultural beverage in certain Canadian festivals.\n\nIn Canadian French, such a product is known as \"eau de vie d'érable\". \n\nMaple liqueur is considered to be a traditional part of Canadian cuisine, in part because of its components being Canadian whiskey and Canadian maple syrup. Both of these components have their own unique history in Canadian cuisine. Notably, maple syrup has also been used in maple sap beer in areas such as Vermont. The process of mixing alcohol with maple syrup has been practiced traditionally in Canada for an extended period of time, and distilleries make their maple liqueur with these same processes.\n\nThe practice of producing maple syrup was practiced by First Nations people in North America, long before Europeans arrived to Canada. First Nations people would collect maple sap in the process of curing meat. The practice of sap collection later was learned by Canadian settlers, who boiled the sap to produce maple syrup. Often, settlers would bore taps into the trees and place a collection bucket underneath it to collect sap. The maple leaf is on the Canadian flag and is a symbol of Canadian culture. As well, Agriculture Canada states that maple syrup continues to be introduced into liqueur blends. Modern collecting methods use tubing, connecting multiple maple trees together. The sap is then collected in a storage tank and evaporated using an evaporator. The basic process has not changed, although modern equipments and methods as stated before are now used. In total, Canada produces 71% of the worlds pure maple syrup, and 91% of that is produced primarily in Quebec.\n\nCanadian whiskey is described as a grain spirit that has been aged in charred oak barrels for at least three years. The practice originated from Scottish settlers, who brought over their practice from overseas. The primary ingredient is corn, but rye is important as it adds its own distinctive flavor. Currently, there are many brands of Canadian whiskey available. Whiskey tends to have an alcohol content of around 40%-50%, although this can be increased through means of distillation.\n\nMaple liqueur is not commonly found in liquor stores as it is easy to make at home. The production process is simple and does not require any special equipment. Homemade maple liqueur is both easy to make and inexpensive. It can be enjoyed on its own, in coffee, or in various different cocktails.\n\nIngredients needed are some kind of liquor to use as a base, usually rye whiskey. The only other ingredient needed to make maple liqueur is pure maple syrup. Table syrup cannot be used as it is often made with high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavouring instead of real maple. Maple syrup comes in various different grades, and the grade of a syrup is determined by its colour, clarity, density, and how strong the maple flavour is. As the sap harvesting season progresses, the maple syrup that is produced becomes darker and more caramel in colour. These darker syrups also tend to have the most intense maple flavour, compared to the lighter taste one would get from syrup produced early in the season. Darker syrups create a more intense maple flavour in the liqueur as well and because of this are often preferred when producing maple liqueur. The darker the syrup that is used, the more intense and full bodied the resulting liqueur will taste.\n\nThe process of making maple liqueur is simple. Equal parts rye whiskey and maple syrup are combined in a sealable mason jar, mixed thoroughly and then left to sit in the refrigerator for at least two weeks. Other spices and ingredients can be added to give different flavors to the liqueur, such as glycerin, honey, or brown sugar. As is with standard aging processes, generally, the longer the liqueur is left to age, the better the final product. After this, the liqueur is ready to be consumed.\n\nAs mentioned previously, commercially produced maple liqueurs are not very common due to how easy the liqueur is to make at home. They have started to increase in popularity in the early 2010s with Crown Royal, a popular whiskey brand, releasing its Crown Royal Maple Finished whiskey in 2013. Varieties other than whiskey also exist, with cream liqueurs being the second most common type. Examples such as Cabot Trail Maple Cream consist of pure maple syrup added to different combinations of rum, grain alcohols, and in this case fresh cream. Sortilège is another popular Canadian brand based in Montreal that produces three distinct varieties of maple liqueurs: Sortilège Whisky, Sortilège Prestige, and Sortilège Cream.\n\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, maple liqueur can often be mixed with other beverages for cocktails, and also goes well in coffee.\n\nThis shooter consists of equal portions of Kahlúa, butterscotch liqueur, and maple liqueur. Usually, these ingredients are mixed in a large shooter glass, and then chased with warm maple syrup.\n\nThis cocktail was made famous by the Sortilège brand of maple liqueurs and is often called a Sortilège mojito, although other brands of maple whiskey can be used. The cocktail combines club soda, mint leaves, lime, brown sugar and ice with maple whiskey to give a traditionally Canadian take on the usual mojito cocktail.\n\nThis drink is a favorite at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. Simply, a teaspoon of maple syrup is put in first, coating the sides of the glass. Then maple liqueur and Bailey's Irish Cream are added in a shot glass at a 1.5:1 ratio respectively. If done properly, Bailey's Irish Cream should form a layer on top, similarly to other shooters, such as a buttery nipple.\n\nOften, coffee can be served in conjunction with Bailey's Irish Cream or Kahlua. As a more culturally Canadian practice, maple liqueur can be used instead to provide smooth sweet maple tones.\n\nMaple cream\n\nAlso known as maple butter, is a dairy less and all-naturally cream made by adding invertase to increase concentration. It is made of 1.5 oz. Maple liqueur and 1 oz. Vanilla Vodka, 4 oz. Vanilla ice cream, 1 scoop of ice, and a dash of maple syrup. The ingredients are evaporated, quickly cooled, stirred and then packaged at room temperature. The process increases the concentration of ingredients to produce a light colored with a smooth, creamy texture cream. Some common uses include as a spread on toast, bagels, muffins, pancakes, doughnuts and other baked goods.\n\nNegus\n\nThis is a warm cocktail made of a mixture of 3 shots Port, 1 shot lemon juice, shot Sugar Maple Liqueur, topped with hot water. Garnish with Nutmeg, dust and drink in a Toddy Glass.\n\nMaple cream ale\n\nFavoured by Canadians for its refreshing peppermint flavour. It is made of 1.5 oz. Maple liqueur, 4 oz. Cream ale soda, ice, topped with a sprig of mint.\n\n\n"}

The dessert is part of the cuisine of the Dominican Republic and is traditionally garnished with milk cookies or with casabe, \"a flatbread made of yuca flour.\"\n\nHabichuelas con dulce is made with red beans, cinnamon, nutmeg, coconut milk, evaporated milk, raisins, butter, sugar and salt. The beans are boiled with salt and then blended to the consistency of soup. The coconut milk and evaporated milk are added along with cooked sweet potato chunks. Cloves and ginger can also be added as flavorings.\n\nThe origins of the dish are unclear, some historians argue that Habichuela con dulce was derived from a Turkish dish called Aşure or Ashure, also known as “Noah’s Pudding.”\nIf this is the case, Ashure travelled to the Dominican Republic in the late 19th or early 20th century along with other classic dishes like Taboulleh and Kibbeh brought over by immigrants from the former Ottoman Empire and adapted along the way. Not only is Ashure made with similar ingredients including sugar, beans and spices, like Habichuela con dulce it is also associated with a religious period of fasting.\n\n“The first month of the Islamic calendar is Muharrem. It is a good deed to fast the first 10 days of Muharrem, and then on the 10th day, the Day of Ashure, to cook and share ashure with your neighbors and relatives.”\n\nAnother theory argues that Habichuela con dulce is derived from a French dish that was brought over in the 19th century by colonists who had settled in what is now Haiti before moving to the Dominican Republic via Aunt Clara’s hometown, Montecristi.\n\nEverything is made in a pot. The thick, creamy appearance comes from a sweet potato. \nRed beans are used to make Habichuela con Dulce. The beans need to be soft, so they are soaked in water overnight. After the beans are soft, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk need to be added to the mix of the beans. Before adding the milk, the mixture is dark, but after adding the milk, it lightens up while boiling. Sweet potatoes and sugar are added for the rich and creamy taste of the dessert. While adding the sugar and sweet potatoes, the mixture can be left thick, or thin so that the mixture flows better, but if it is left in the refrigerator, it will thicken as it cools. Habichuela con Dulce can have added spices for a sweeter taste. While the Habichuela con Dulce is mixing, spices such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and vanilla can be added depending on the family's recipe. After the mixture is done, raisins and butter are added to the mixture. Usually, the habichuela con dulce is left to cool down for a few hours before it is eaten. The dessert can also contain cookies, milk or a type of cassava bread.\n\nA similar form of Habichuela con Dulce is red bean paste, which is a dark red, sweet bean paste.

Unlike the typical sampot, it is more of a pant than a skirt. It is a rectangular piece of cloth measuring three meters long and one meter wide.

In the era of the Khmer empire, most of the people were likely to read and see The Reamker at the Angkor Wat carving in the first floor as well. The origin of sampot chang kben is known as Indian. Also prayed and blessed to was a deva known as Hanuman, the guard of Prince Rama in India's famous mythology, \"Ramayana\", as well as the Khmer adaptation, \"Reamker\". To show its power, Indians preferred to wear the sampot chang kben as their costume but today, countries under the Greater India, such as Cambodia, also wear it for special occasions.\n\nIn Ramayana mythology, Hanuman is a symbol of bravery, cleverness, and power, so the people, when wearing the sampot chang kben, always drop a tail at the back like Hanuman's monkey tail. This practice lead a lot of people to believe that all Indians were guards of Hanuman. The influence of sampot chang kben, known as Dhoti in India, were strongly sacked into Khmer culture from the ancient times to today. Apparently, this fabric is also known to be worn by Tamil people in south India, as well as Khmer people, till today.\n\nIn fact, sampot chang kben is the tradition of southern India, and was imported to early Cambodian Kingdom, Funan by \"King Kaundinya I\".\n\nIn the middle of the 13th and 14th centuries, Thai people (from Sukhothai Kingdom, known as Thailand today) and Lao people (from Lan Xang, known as Lao today) had adopted the wearing of sampot chang kben because they considered it superior for enjoying the special occasions, and useful for royalty or monarchy in their local royal palace, because the Thai people and Lao people had used sampot chang kben in a similar way.\nIn ancient times, the sampot chang kben was worn only by men, but in modern times, it is worn by both men and women, especially for a formal celebration. It is, for instance, worn by a bride and groom in a Khmer wedding. The general style of the garment has changed over the years:\n\nToday, the sampot chang kben is worn mostly for formal occasions, or by royalty.\n\n"}

The dish arose when buttermilk became commonly available in Denmark in the early 1900s and was eaten chilled most days during the summer as a dessert or snack. Since 1979, there have been ready-made varieties on the Danish market, originally from Esbjerg Dairy, but now from a range of dairies, including Arla.\n\nThe earliest mentions of koldskål are from the 1700s, where the term was used to describe a sweet beer-based gruel, however this dish is not commonly eaten any more. It was not until the 1800s that recipes for buttermilk-based koldskål appeared, and it took until the 1900s for the dish to become a mainstay in Danish homes.\n\nTraditionally, buttermilk koldskål is served with dry, crispy biscuits such as kammerjunker or \"tvebakker\". Sometimes sliced strawberries are added.\n\nLike most activities in Denmark, the consumption of koldskål is highly dependent on the weather, and a couple of weeks of warm weather can double the demand for ready-made koldskål.

The length depends on one's comfort and the fire's size. The thickness of the bread-holding end is around 1.5–2 cm. The thicker the stick, the heavier it is and thus the harder it is to hold. However, a branch that is too thin will bend under its own weight if it is freshly cut. The bark should be whittled from the branch 15–20 cm in from the end, where the dough will be wrapped.\n\nThe bonfire should be gradually burned so far down that there are only glowing pieces of wood left, with almost no flames. The most suitable types of firewood are from hardwood trees similar to beech and oak, but other hardwoods can be used, except for poplar and aspen, which create a sour smoke. Conifers, especially fir, are unsuitable because they do not create many glowing embers, and moreover pop and spark so that cooking over such a fire can become an unpleasant and messy affair. The fire must burn down a little, so that there are not many flames, and the embers can be spread out a little so that there is enough room for the twist breads.\n\nWhen the fire is ready, the dough is rolled out into a long sausage, just thick enough that the stick can bear the weight of the dough. The dough is twisted around the peeled end of the stick, starting from the outside. The ends are smushed closed so that the dough will not unravel.\n\nThe dough is then baked over coals, not flames. The baker must keep a good distance of about 15–30 cm and turn the stick regularly so that the bread is baked evenly. Tired arms may result in the bread dipping down into the fire pit, so a log or the like can be used to keep the branch upright.\n\nWhen the bread sounds hollow over its whole body when tapped gently with a knife, it is done and can be gently pulled off the stick when it has cooled down enough. It can be eaten by itself or with butter, marmalade, cheese, and the like. If the dimensions of the stick are similar to a hot dog, one can squirt ketchup, mustard and other toppings into the hole of the twist bread and stick a boiled or roasted hot dog inside. In this case it is most practical to be careful in the positioning of the dough, so that there are no cracks.\n\n"}

The pastry when cooked created a tough protective layer around the food inside. When cooked, the pastry would be discarded as it was virtually inedible. However the shell became soaked with the meat juices and was sometimes eaten by house servants after the meal had concluded.\n\nIts main purpose was simply to create a solid container for the pie’s ingredients. The flour itself was stronger than normal flour, often made from coarsely ground rye, and suet, which was mixed with hot water to create an early form of hot water crust pastry.\n\nHuff paste could be moulded into a variety of shapes, called 'coffyns' or 'coffers', similar to a Cornish pasty. Another benefit of these early pies was that meat could be preserved for several months and the food contained within was protected from contamination. It also allowed food to be preserved so that country dwellers could send it over long distances as gifts to their friends in other towns or areas.\n\nOccasionally shells of huff paste were baked empty, or \"blind\". After baking, the pastry was brushed with egg yolk to give it a golden color. Later, the shell was filled with a mixture of meat and spices and then baked.\n\nA dish from Wiltshire, called the Devizes Pie, is layered forcemeat or offal cooked under a huff paste.\n\n"}

The banana-leaf package containing food is secured with \"lidi seumat\" (a small nail made from central rib of coconut-leaf), and then steamed or grilled on charcoal. This cooking technique allows the rich spice mixture to be compressed against the main ingredients inside the individual banana leaf package while being cooked, and also adds a distinct aroma of cooked or burned banana leaf. Although being cooked simultaneously with food, the banana leaf is a non-edible material and is discarded after cooking.\n\nThe cooking technique employing banana leaf as the wrapper is widely distributed throughout Indonesia and it is known in many names in several dialects; \"pais\" in Sundanese, \"brengkesan\" in Javanese, \"brengkes\" in Palembang, \"pelasan\" in Javanese-Osing, \"palai\" in Minangkabau, and \"payeh\" in Acehnese. The common Indonesian name \"pepes\" was derived from Sundanese word \"papais\"; the plural form of \"pais\" in Sundanese language. Because its popularity was first contributed through the Sundanese cuisine, today pepes is often associated with Sundanese cuisine.\n\nThis technique is most commonly used to prepare fish. In West Java, \"ikan mas\" (\"Cyprinus carpio\") is the most popular fish to be cooked as pepes. In Palembang, \"patin\" (\"Pangasius sutchi\") and \"lais\" (\"Kryptopterus cryptopterus\") are the most common fish to be used, while in West Sumatra, people use \"bilih\" fish (\"Mystacoleucus padangensis\"). \n\nHowever, fish is not the only ingredient to be made for pepes. Seafood, meat, chicken, tofu, tempeh, oncom, mushroom or vegetables are also available to be prepared in this method. There are many variations of pepes recipes. Other seafoods such as shrimp and squid, although less common, can be used in pepes. Non-fish meat such as chicken and minced beef mixed with egg can also be used. In Palembang, the dish pepes tempoyak is well known, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container. A rather exotic and unusual meat might also be cooked as pepes, for example as swikee variations, frog legs and frog eggs might be prepared as pepes. The method is used in several Indonesian dishes, and also become the name of a dish prepared in this manner, for example: \nPepes products are typically consumed with steamed rice. Otak-otak is similar to pepes, it is a mixture of fish and tapioca flour with spices wrapped in banana leaf. The vegetables with shredded coconut pepes is called \"Botok\". \"Buntil\" is prepared in a similar way, but used papaya or cassava leaves instead of banana leaves, making the wrapping edible as part of the dish. A similar Malaysia dish employing banana leaf is called Sata.\n\nPepes is made by mixing descaled and gutted fish or any type of food with a mixture of spices including salt, chilli, shallots, garlic, turmeric, ginger, lemongrass, curry leaf, candlenut, tamarind, tomato, and lemon basil all wrapped in a banana leaf. Sundanese cuisine recognizes two types of pepes: the regular or “plain” variety and yellow pepes, which is cooked with turmeric. The leaf is wrapped tight and secured with a stick at each ends, then steamed or grilled. To make a soft-boned fish pepes, the method using pressure-cooker or prolonged cooking time is employed.\n"}

It is commonly found in Central and East Java.\n\nBotok seems to be a byproduct of coconut milk production, to save and reuse the grated coconut flesh that might be otherwise discarded. Commonly, the grated coconut flesh flakes are discarded after squeezing it to acquire the coconut milk. However, by cooking them in banana leaf with additional mixture and spices, they can also be eaten as additional dish. Another way to save the grated coconut residue is to saute them as \"serundeng\". Today however, to acquire tastier and richer taste, many recipes insist on using only freshly grated coconut flesh that still contains coconut milk. Botok is typically consumed with rice.\n\nThe grated coconut flesh is mixed with chilli, salt, pepper, lemon basil and \"salam\" (Indonesian bay-leaf) and additional ingredient. This mixture is placed upon a piece of banana leaf, and then the leaf is wrapped tight and secured with a stick, then placed on a steamer. The most basic \"botok\" usually uses simple and cheaper ingredients, such as minced tempeh, tofu or anchovy. After the \"botok\" is cooked, the banana leaf package is opened and served with steamed rice. After perfectly cooked, the grated coconut and sometimes the egg addition, acted as the binding agent of the whole \"botok\" ingredients.\n\nTo add flavour and nutrients, many botok recipes and variants might use additional ingredients as protein source, such as \"petai cina\", \"belimbing wuluh\", \"ares\" (the core of a banana trunk), mushroom, tofu, tempeh, anchovy, wahoo, catfish, salted fish, egg, salted egg, shrimp, minced beef or even bee larvae.

Botok is often considered as the variations of \"pepes\", the cooking method using banana leaf. However botok is identified more specific by using shredded coconut flesh, while pepes usually contains no coconut at all.\n\nThe South African dish of \"bobotie\" is thought to be the derivative of Indonesian \"bobotok\". It is however, quite different as it uses minced beef and eggs, with the absence of grated coconut and banana leaf package. The role of grated coconut and eggs as binding agent in \"bobotok\" seems to be replaced by beaten eggs, milk and shredded bread in \"bobotie\".\n\n"}

It can be used to make a wide variety of nanostructured carbons, simple production of brown coal substitute, synthesis gas, liquid petroleum precursors and humus from biomass with release of energy. The process, which technically imitates the brown coal formation (german \"\" literally \"to coal process\") taking place in nature within 50,000 to 50 million years within a few hours, was investigated by Friedrich Bergius and first described in 1913.\n\nThe carbon efficiency of most processes to convert organic matter to fuel is relatively low. I.e. the proportion of carbon contained in the biomass, which is later contained in the usable end product is relatively low:\nIn poorly designed systems the unused carbon escapes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, or when fermented as methane. Both gases are considered to be climate-damaging. In addition, heat is released in these processes, which is not generally used. Advanced modern system capture nearly all the gases and use the heat as part of the process or for district heating. \n\nThe problem with the production of biodiesel from oil plants is the fact that only the energy contained in the fruit can be used. If the entire plant could be used for fuel production, the energy yield could be increased by a factor of three to five with the same cultivation area when growing fast-growing plants such as willow, poplar, miscanthus, hemp, reeds or forestry, while simultaneously reducing energy, fertilizer and herbicide use, with the possibility of using - for current energy plant cultivation - poor soil. Hydrothermal carbonization makes it possible - similar to the biomass-to-liquid process - to use almost all of the carbon contained in the biomass for fuel generation.\nIt is a new variation of an old field (biomass conversion to biofuel) that has recently been further developed in Germany. It involves moderate temperatures and pressures over an aqueous solution of biomass in a dilute acid for several hours. The resulting matter reportedly captures 100% of the carbon in a \"biocoal\" powder that could provide feedsource for soil amendment (similar to biochar) and further studies in economic nanomaterial production.\n\nBiomass is heated together with water to 180°C in a pressure vessel, in particular vegetable material (in the following reaction equation, simplified as sugar with the formula C 6 H 12 O 6). The pressure rises to about 1 MPa (10 bar). During the reaction, oxonium ions are also formed which reduce the pH to pH 5 and lower. This step can be accelerated by adding a small amount of citric acid. In this case, at low pH values, more carbon passes into the aqueous phase. The effluent reaction is exothermic, that is, energy is released. After 12 hours, the carbon of the reactants is completely reacted, 90 to 99% of the carbon is present as an aqueous sludge of porous brown coal spheres (C 6 H 2 O) with pore sizes between 8 and 20 nm as a solid phase, the remaining 1 to 10% of carbon is either dissolved in the aqueous phase or converted to carbon dioxide. The reaction equation for the formation of brown coal is:\n\nformula_1\n\nThe reaction can be stopped in several stages with incomplete elimination of water, giving different intermediate products. After a few minutes, liquid intermediate lipophilic substances are formed, but their handling is very difficult because of their high reactivity. Subsequently, these substances polymerize and peat-like structures are formed, which are present as intermediates after about 8 hours.\n\nTheoretically, the reaction with certain metal particles could be catalyzed, but these would be added very quickly with the products and lose their function.\n\nAs a result of the exothermic reaction of hydrothermal carbonization, about 3/8 of the calorific value of the biomass based on the dry mass is released (with a high lignin, resin and / or oil content at least 1/4). If the process is managed properly, it is possible to use this waste heat from wet biomass to produce dry biocoal and to use some of the converted energy for energy generation.\n\nIn a large-scale technical implementation of hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge, it has been shown that about 20% of the fuel energy content contained in 90% end-dried HTC coal is required to heat the process. Furthermore, approximately 5% of the generated energy content is necessary for electrical operation of the plant. It has proved particularly beneficial in the case of the HTC process that, with mechanical dehydration, more than 60% of the dry substance content can be achieved in the raw carbon, and thus the energy and equipment expenditure for the final drying of the coal is low compared to conventional drying methods of these slurries.\n\nCompared to sludge digestion with subsequent drying, the energy requirement of the HTC is lower by approximately 20% of the electrical energy and approximately 70% of the thermal energy. The amount of energy produced by the HTC as a storable coal is simultaneously 10% higher. Compared to conventional thermal drying of sewage sludge, the HTC saves 62% of electricity and 69% of thermal energy due to its significantly simpler drainage.\n\nAn exothermic process design would be advantageous in which the carbon content remains biologically, chemically or thermally convertible without further oxidation of the biomass. This could lead to a specific reduction in CO release .\n\nAccording to Markus Antonietti, the most important point is \"... that one has a simple method of transforming atmospheric CO via the detour of biomass into a stable and safe storage form, a carbon sink.\" With hydrothermal carbonization, as well as with other methods for the coking of biomass, a large quantity of carbon could be stored decently all over the world. Essentially safer than the currently discussed liquid or gaseous sequestration of carbon dioxide. With sufficient chemical stability of the coal, it could also be used very well for the improvement of soils (see also Terra preta ).\n\nThe artificial humus could be used for the re- greening of eroded surfaces. Due to the increased plant growth in this way, additional carbon dioxide could be bound from the atmosphere so that a carbon efficiency of more than 1 or a negative CO balance could be achieved. The resulting carbon sludge could be used to burn or operate novel fuel cell types with a 60% efficiency, as currently being researched at Harvard University. In order to produce conventional fuels, the carbon-water mixture would have to be heated more intensively, so that so-called synthesis gas, a gas mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is formed:\n\nformula_2\n\nThis synthesis gas could be used to produce gasoline via the Fischer-Tropsch process. Alternatively, the liquid intermediates that are formed during the incomplete conversion of the biomass could be used for fuel and plastic production.\n\nIn addition, the resulting carbon mud can be briquetted and marketed as an environmentally friendly carbon dioxide-neutral \"natural carbon\" - Compared with the starting biomass, this can be dried by means of deposition or filtering or pressing with a lower energy consumption and, due to its higher energy content per volume or mass, reduce transport costs and require smaller storage areas.\n\nAn advantage of hydrothermal carbonization is that the usability of plant biomass is not restricted to plants with low moisture contents and the energy that can be obtained without carbon dioxide emission is not reduced by necessary drying measures or is usable directly for drying the end products. For example, even scarcely usable plant material, such as waste from gardens and urban green areas, can be used to produce energy, carbon dioxide is also being saved, which, together with even more climate-damaging methane, would otherwise be produced by bacterial conversion of the biomass.\n\nIn recent years HTC was applied as upstream conditioning technology for phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge with the benefit of higher yields.\n\nThe major problem in the production of synthesis gas from biomass is the formation of tar, which can avoided during hydrothermal process management. However, it is not easy to see why this is the best way to process biocarbon. A biomass slurry should be decomposed into CO and H under supercritical conditions at 400°C and a pressure of at least 221.2 bar (critical temperature of water is 374°C), which requires a high energy input.\n\nAn appropriate process management as well as problems in the collection, transportation and storage of accumulated biomass are unresolved in this problem. These processes also require energy, which should be less than is released by hydrothermal carbonation.\n\nAn advantage over dry thermal processes of refining biofuels with low moisture content is not so obvious. Even at the end of the 19th century, a weakly pyrolysed charcoal, which still contains at least 4/5 of the calorific value of the wood, was propagated for thermal processes.\n\nIn Relzow near Anklam (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), a hydrothermal carbonisation plant was officially inaugurated in the middle of November 2017 in \"Innovation Park Vorpommern\". According to the company, the HTC plant in Relzow represents a \"new stage in the field of hydrothermal carbonisation\" [6]. AVA is alsothe first company in the world to establish a HTC plant on industrial level in 2010.[7]\n\nAlready in Summer 2016 a HTC plant for the treatment of sewage sludge was put in operation in Jining/China to produce renewable fuel for the local coal fired power plant. According to the manufacturer TerraNova Energy it is in continuous operation with an annual capacity of 14.000 tons. \n\n\n\n"}

Although the name suggests it contains squab (young domestic pigeon), in fact it contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten around the world in the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.\n\nAlthough it is not known exactly where squab pie was first made, it is clear that it was somewhere in South West England. There are references to it originating in Gloucestershire, Devon and Cornwall. Although it appears that squab pie did originally contain pigeons, mutton and apples have been used as a substitute since at least 1737 using a recipe that has remained in cookbooks for years afterwards. This misnaming has meant that the pie is considered to be a surprise. Squab is described as tender with a mild berry flavour, and so it is possible that the combination of mutton and apples created a similar flavour. There is also a theory that the name squab pie is short for \"squabble pie\", as it stems from a disagreement over whether to have a meat or apple pie.\n\nThere are many variations to the squab pie in England, although it traditionally includes mutton, it has come to mean a pie with many ingredients or a \"scraps pie\". Squab pie in Devon can be served with clotted cream. Alternatively, in America, it is cooked with squab, and is synonymous with pigeon pie.\n\nSquab pie is a mutton pie with a shortcrust pastry lid. It should be made with at least one layer of onions, followed by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops. The mixture should be covered with water, though less than in some pies, covered with pastry and baked in the oven for about two hours.\n\nWithin the UK, the most common variation is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken.\n\nOutside of England, the concept of squab pie does exist, but in a more literal form actually containing squab. Known as Picconi All'Inglese, one Italian chef explains that he is aware that the recipe does not match the traditional English version, but he \"[does] not care a fig\". In America, squab pie still uses squab. It was included in a \"Cooking for profit\" book in San Francisco, to make a pie using 18 squabs in a gravy.\n\nIn 2009, less than 3% of British teenagers had tried the dish and it has been listed amongst the \"at risk\" British Classics. A prominent critic of squab pie was Charles Dickens' journal \"All the Year Round\":\n\nSquab pie has been the subject of poetry. In \"The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale\" published in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.\n\nThe ingredients are given in verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin, during William Sandys' 1846 tour around Cornwall. Sandys also includes a story of Christmas-time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with mashed potatoes and pilchards. In \"Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell's Mutton Pies\", published in 1772, Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall. The Devon author, William Crossing, writing in 1911, discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie: \"Mutton, onions, apples and dough, Make a good pie as any I know.\" He does not say, however, from where he heard it. In the song \"Glorious Devon\" written by Sir Edward German in 1905, several Devonshire dishes receive praise: \"Squab pie, junket and cider brew, Richest cream of the cow, What 'ud Old England without 'em do?\"\n\nAnother legend surrounding squab pie, along with the other unusual pies of Cornwall, is that they were the reason that the Devil never came to Cornwall. \nIn his book \"Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The drolls, traditions, and superstitions of old Cornwall\", a collection of Cornish traditions, Robert Hunt explains that the Devil crossed the River Tamar to Torpoint. The chapter, entitled \"The Devil's Coits, etc.\", reasons that the Devil discovered the Cornish would put anything in a pie and decided to leave before they took a fancy to a \"devilly\" pie, returning to Devon.\n\n\n"}

It is a popular poultry product, especially in North America, where it is traditionally consumed as part of culturally significant events such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as in standard cuisine.\n\nTurkeys are sold sliced and ground, as well as \"whole\" in a manner similar to chicken with the head, feet, and feathers removed. Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a sandwich meat or served as cold cuts; in some cases where recipes call for chicken, it can be used as a substitute. Ground turkey is sold, and frequently marketed as a healthy alternative to ground beef. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey is usually considered to end up less moist than other poultry meats such as chicken or duck.\n\nWild turkeys, while technically the same species as domesticated turkeys, have a very different taste from farm-raised turkeys. Almost all of the meat is \"dark\" (including the breast) with a more intense flavor. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer, due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.\n\nA large amount of turkey meat is processed. It can be smoked, and as such, is sometimes sold as turkey ham or turkey bacon, which is considered to be far healthier than pork bacon. Twisted helices of deep-fried turkey meat, sold as \"turkey twizzlers\", came to prominence in the UK in 2004 when chef Jamie Oliver campaigned to have them and similar foods removed from school dinners.\n\nUnlike chicken eggs, turkey eggs are not commonly sold as food due to the high demand for whole turkeys and lower output of eggs as compared with other fowl (not only chickens, but even ducks or quail). The value of a single turkey egg is estimated to be about $3.50 on the open market, substantially more than an entire carton of one dozen chicken eggs.\n\nTurkeys are traditionally eaten as the main course of Thanksgiving dinner in the United States and Canada, and at Christmas feasts in much of the rest of the world (often as stuffed turkey).\n\nTurkey meat has been eaten by indigenous peoples from Mexico, Central America, and the southern tier of the United States since antiquity. In the 15th century, Spanish ‘’conquistadores’’ took Aztec turkeys back to Europe. \n\nTurkey was eaten as such as early as the 16th century in England. Before the 20th century, pork ribs were the most common food for the North American holidays, as the animals were usually slaughtered in November. Turkeys were once so abundant in the wild that they were eaten throughout the year, the food considered commonplace, whereas pork ribs were rarely available outside of the Thanksgiving-New Year season. While the tradition of turkey at Christmas spread throughout Britain in the 17th century, among the working classes, it became common to serve goose, which remained the predominant roast until the Victorian era.\n\nIn the UK in 2009, 7,734,000 turkeys were consumed on Christmas Day.\n\nTurkey with mole sauce is regarded as Mexico's \"national dish\".\n\nBoth fresh and frozen turkeys are used for cooking; as with most foods, fresh turkeys are generally preferred, although they cost more. Around holiday seasons, high demand for fresh turkeys often makes them difficult to purchase without ordering in advance. For the frozen variety, the large size of the turkeys typically used for consumption makes defrosting them a major endeavor: a typically sized turkey will take several days to properly defrost.\n\nTurkeys are usually baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the remainder of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is done because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills, paper frills or \"booties\" that are placed on the end of drumsticks or bones of other cutlets.\n\nIn some areas, particularly the American South, they may also be deep fried in hot oil (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey has become something of a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.\n\nTurkey contains more protein per ounce than other meats. The white meat of turkey is generally considered healthier than dark meat because of its lower saturated fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Turkey is reputed to cause sleepiness, but holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, all of which are bigger contributors to post-meal sleepiness than the tryptophan in turkey.\nAfter World War II, cheap imported turkey tail became popular in Samoa. Because the cut is so fatty, it has been attributed to the rise in obesity rates in the Pacific. To combat obesity, turkey tails were banned from 2007 to 2013, only allowed back in Samoa to appease the demands of the World Trade Organization.\nFor Thanksgiving in the United States, turkey is typically served stuffed or with dressing (on the side), with cranberry sauce and gravy. Common complementary dishes include mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, green beans, squash, and sweet potatoes. Pie is the usual dessert, especially those made from pumpkins, apples, or pecans.\n\nWhen eaten at Christmas in the United Kingdom, turkey is traditionally served with winter vegetables, including roast potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and parsnips. Cranberry sauce is the traditional condiment in the northern rural areas of the United Kingdom where wild cranberries grow. In the south and in urban areas, where cranberries until recently were difficult to obtain, bread sauce was used in its place, but the availability of commercial cranberry sauce has seen a rise in its popularity in these areas, too. Sometimes, sausage meat, cocktail sausages, or liver wrapped in bacon is also served (known as bacon rolls or \"pigs in blankets\").\n\nEspecially during holiday seasons, stuffing or dressing is traditionally served with turkey. The many varieties include oatmeal, chestnut, sage and onion (flavored bread), cornbread, and sausage are the most traditional. Stuffing is used to stuff the turkey (as the name implies) or may be cooked separately and served as a side dish (dressing).\n\n"}

It stems from the sea-faring world, used as an interjection to catch the attention of other crew members, and as a general greeting. It can sometimes also be found on land spoken as a general greeting, again, especially in a maritime context.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell originally suggested 'ahoy-hoy' be adopted as the standard greeting when answering a telephone, before 'hello' (suggested by Thomas Edison) became common.\n\nAhoy is a combination of the call 'hoy' plus the sound 'a', presumably added to draw more attention to the cry. 'Hoy!' was a common call in England to drive cattle. The earliest known example is from William Langland, in whose 1393 epic poem, \"Piers the Ploughman\", the word first appears in Middle English: 'And holpen to erie þis half acre with 'hoy! troly! lolly!', which roughly translates to \"And helped to plow this half acre with 'hoy! troly! lolly!'\".\n\nSeamen used the word \"hoy\" in the form of \"hoay\". The Scottish poet William Falconer, author of a nautical dictionary, wrote 1769: \"If the master intends to give any order to the people in the main-top, he calls, Main-top, hoay! To which they answer, Holloa!\", Two other dictionaries from 1805 list Falconers call as \"hoay\" and answer \"holloa\". \"Ahoy\" does not appear.\n\nFunctionally related with \"hoy\" is a group of similar sounding calls and greetings in the Germanic languages: Middle and Modern English \"hey\" and \"hi\", German, Dutch, Danish and Norwegian \"hei\", in Sweden \"hej\", and the Dutch greeting \"hoi\".\n\nIn Old Russian \"\" was a standard greeting which is still present in Russian folk fairy tales.\n\nIn Czech and Slovak, 'Ahoj' () is a commonly used as an informal greeting, comparable to \"\"Hello\"\". It was borrowed from English and became popular among people engaged in water sports. It gained wide currency by the 1930s.\n\nTwo discoveries in Middle High German literature reveal interjections similar to \"ahoi\". Their forms show no links to the middle English form \"hoy\" and their meanings offer little connection to the call used to establish contact.\n\nIn around 1290 Heinrich von Freiberg used the form \"ahiu\" twice in his adaptation of Tristan as a greeting: \"ahiu, Parmenois Tristan!\", alongside \"ahiu, wie schône sie het sich ûz gefêgetieret\", English: \"ahiu, how prettily she has dressed!\". \"Ahiu\" has the same meaning as the interjections \"ahiv, ahiw\" and \"hiu\", which occur in this text as well. As part of a group of words consisting of \"ahî, ay\" and \"ahei\", which express pain, desire and admiration, \"ahiu\" can be found before exclamative or optative sentences and in emphatic greetings.\n\nBetween 1331 and 1341, in his work \"Kronike von Pruzinlant\", Nikolaus von Jeroschin inserted the expression \"â hui! sô wêr ich hôchgemût / sô ich ir stirne sêhe blôz\". Ahui, together with \"aheia, ahi\" and \"ahu\", belongs to a group of words that express incommensurable joy, esteem and similar positive attitudes.\n\nSeamen had been using ahoy long before the first recorded use in print in well-known seafaring songs or Shanties. There is a lack of research into handwritten letters and records from seamen. Therefore, printed works concerning the use of the \"Ahoy\"-word family have only restricted significance regarding the temporal and geographical distribution.\n\n\"Ahoy\" represents the original English form and its first maritime use was recorded in 1751 as a new word in nautical language. The first evidence for the German word \"ahoi\" is found in 1828. Ahoy is widely used in the Northern and Baltic Maritime World. It expresses semantically a change in distance or presupposes it. In most languages it can be used as an interjection, whilst in others it takes the form of a verb (e. g. English - \"to ahoy\", German - \"ahoi sagen\") or a Noun (e. g. Swedish - \"ohoj\", German - \"das Ahoi\") It is not known how the word spread in harbour towns or on ships with an international crew, especially as similar sounding interjections in a neighbouring language may have either interfered with or promoted the adoption.\n\nIn spoken German both ways of addressing people work, so either the command or the addressee can come first, e. g. \"'Pfeil, ahoi!\" oder \"Ahoi, Pfeil\"!\" although in written German there is no Comma between the two words. In other languages this is variable.\n\nThe exclamation \"Ho! the house a hoy!\", pronounced by a seaman in Tobias Smollet\"s The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle\" (1751), is the first example of the expression \"ahoy\" in the English language. One early example of the expression can be found in William Falconer's Dictionary of the Marine (1780): \"The usual expression is, Hoa, the ship ahoay!\". In the first edition of this dictionary (1769) the expression was still in its previous form \"hoay\".\n\nIn the 1780s \"ahoy\" was already used on the stage in London to create a sea-faring atmosphere. In this way it reached a very wide audience. In the comedy \"The Walloons\", brought to the stage in 1782 by the playwright Richard Cumberland, the expression was used to catch someone's attention: \"Ahoy! you Bumboat, bring yourself this way\". The work was published posthumously in 1813.\n\nIn another early documented source, as well, \"ahoy\" was similarly used to catch someone's attention. The expression \"ahoy\" was probably first heard in public in 1789 in the lyrics of a Sea Shanty, a worksong sung by able seamen, when the English composer Charles Dibdin (1745-1814) performed his musical \"The Oddities\" in London. This work also contains the song \"Ben Backstay\", about a boatswain. The song goes: \"And none as he so merrily / Could pipe all hands ahoy\". The lyrics were not published until 1826.\n\nIn the 1799 edition of Samuel Johnson´s dictionary the word \"ahoy\" (pronounced ə´hɔi) is still missing, but in the 1824 edition it was said \"to be almost as important as holla\", supported by a quotation from Cumberland in 1813. The first entry in this popular reference book can be seen as an acceptance of \"ahoy\" into the English language. In the first half of the 19th century the word already began to find its way into many neighbouring languages. A speculation from 1835 about the origin of the French word oyez, which means \"hört!\" in German, implies an early philological engagement with the word. It had already appeared in a metaphorical context before, when in the American trade town of Philadelphia a preacher started to build a church for sailors in 1819. According to his memoirs, sailors used to greet him with \"Ship ahoi\" and to ask where he was going. The preacher used to answer back: \"To the New Jerusalem harbour\". We sail under the admiral Jesus, a good captain. We need men: \"As the sailors said right before they were taken on: \"Now we come in and listen to your conditions\"\n\nThe variant \"ohoy\" was used early on as a synonym for \"ahoy.\" In one anecdote, printed in 1791, it appears as the ironic greeting of a captain to his boatman who is dressed up like a Romney Marsh Sheep when he entered the stage: \"Ohoa, the boatswain, the Romney, Ohoy!\" The \"boatswain answered \"Holloa\" and disappeared. The Scottish poet Thomas Campbell published a satirical poem in 1821, in which a rider shouted: \"Murderer, stop, ohoy, oh\". In 1836 the Scottish novelist Allan Cunningham wrote: \"Ohoy, Johnnie Martin! Ohoy, Tom Dempster! be busy my \"merry lads, and take me on board \".\n\nThe form \"ohoy\" has been adopted by several Nordic languages.\n\nTheir dictionaries give the English \"ohoy\" as a single source word, usually before \"ahoy\" sometimes afterwards.\n\nThe term remained widely unknown to German readers until 1840s, since the translators of popular maritime literature of the time avoided it. 1843 saw the first German translation of the word å-hoj to \"hiaho\" from a Swedish novel.\n\nThe earliest documentation of the term in German language appears not in non-fictional maritime texts but the nautical prose. In the beginning, the circumstances point to uncertainties regarding the usage of the word. Since the late 1820s, the words ahoy and ahoi marked with the coda -i, a feature demonstrating Germanization of ahoy, can be found in the German translation of English novels and fictions. Around the same time, the term was used by authors in original German texts on rare occasions. Ahoi became an established term around 1950 as it was used in the works of widely-read authors from the 1940s onward.\n\nThe term rarely appeared in dictionaries in the 19th century. It is not included in the \"Urduden\" dictionary published in 1880. The Grimm brothers’ Dictionary of German (Deutsches Wörterbuch) did not recognize the word at the time; it did not appear in the first volume, published in 1852, with entries up to the keyword \"allverein\". The DWB’s second edition published in 1998, documents the earliest uses of the term as occurring in 1846 and 1848. In addition, the original index cards for the dictionary, which are kept in the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, do not contain any earlier entries. The standard work \"Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache\" by Friedrich Kluge lists ahoi as a separate entry since the 1999 edition.\n\nThe automatic search for appropriate keywords in digitalized books on the internet and in offline-databanks does only lead to a few useful results. German light fiction was printed so badly in the first half of the 19th century that even today good recognition software still produces a great number of errors, so that records are not found. Research in original catalogues is still necessary for a systematic search.\n\nThe earliest creditable use of the word \"ahoi\" dates back to 1828. In 1827 the American story-teller James Fenimore Cooper published his pirate story \"The Red Rover\". The following year \"der rothe Freibeuter\" was released in Frankfurt am Main. The translator Karl Meurer did not translate all of the words. The command \"All hands make sail, ahoy!\" was translated as \"Alle zu Hauf! Die Segel hißt!\", but later on in the novel \"ahoy\" was translated as \"aho\", which could have been a moment of inattention. However, Meurer translated the phrase \"All hands to mischief, ahoy!\", as a signalled approval of amusement on board and so became \"Alle zu Hauf! zu Possen, ahoi!\". Meurer also translated the phrase \"Good humour, ahoy!\" with \"Bei den Possen gehalten, ahoi!\"\n\nIn 1830 Cooper used the word \"ahoy\" five times in a story whose title was the same as the name of the ship \"Water Witch\" (German \"\"Wassernixe\"\"). A translation by Gottfried Friedenberg was released in the same year and he chose \"ahoi\" four times. Friedenberg missed out the first occurrence of the word \"ahoy\". It is possible that in 1830 the German word was relatively new. In later editions this mistake was corrected. Friedrich Knickerbocker, who published the second translation in 1831, overlooked or rewrote ahoy also incorrectly as \"Holüber!\"\n\nThe \"Wer da\", or \"Who's there?\", the phrase he introduced once was not new. In 1824 and 1827 the German editions of Cooper's story \"The Pilot\" were released, in which \"ahoi\" was translated with similar expressions, such as \"Wer da!\", \"Wer da?\", \"heda\" or \"He! He!\". Not until 1842 in \"der Lotse\" (English, the pilot) ahoy became the standard interjection due to Eduard Mauch's translation, however this contained four \"ahoy\"s and one \"ahoi\".\n\nIn 1835 and 1836 the anonymous translator of the two-volume story \"Trelawney's Abentheuer in Ostindien\", which was published by sailor and later author Edward John Trelawny in 1832, who kept \"ahoy\" as a loanword.\n\nIn 1837 the novel \"Lykkens Yndling/Das Glückskind\" was released in Danish by the author Carl Bernhard, who had also translated it into German. Bernhard was the pseudonym of the Danish novelist Andreas Nikolai de Saint-Aubain. This is probably the earliest import from a Scandinavian language and gave us the phrase \"Ahoi, en Sejler\"\" meaning \"Ahoi, ein Segler!\" (English - ahoy, sailor!).\n\nThe expression \"ahoy\" is documented in a German source text from 1829. In her short story \"Die\" \"Armenierin,\" the Saxon writer Charlotte Eleonore Wilhelmine von Gersdorff inserted this word several times in a specialist context, both as an invocation and to express encouragement. The author also worked as a translator from English.\n\nThe Austrian writer Charles Sealsfield first used the word \"ahoy\" in its original form. Sealsfield, who was also known by his real name Carl Anton Postl, lived temporarily in New Orleans, where he had many contacts with sailors. In his novel \"Morton oder die große Tour,\" which was published for the first time in Zürich in 1835, a big crowd of excited people in Piccadilly Circus in London is summoned with the exclamation \"Gare! Gare! take care! Hallo ho! A hoy!\". The same exclamation is still to be found in the following editions of 1844 and 1846. In the footnotes to a reprint, the word \"Gare\" was appropriately corrected to \"Care\", but wrongly used in the text in all three editions. The English form is correctly given, in two words, which was very common at that time.\n\nIn Sealsfield's novel \"Pflanzerleben\" (Zürich, 1836), the word is used before uttering an order: \"Ahoi! Ahoi! (...) Hört ihr nicht? die Pferde dem Herrn Grafen abnehmen.\", that is \"Ahoi! Ahoi! (...) Don't you hear? Take the Count's horses.\" An English translation of the book appeared in the United States in 1844, in which the word \"ahoi\" is kept in its German form. Also in his last novel, \"Süden und Norden\" (1843), Sealsfield again used the English spelling, in two words: \"Sail a hoy – an ennemys sail!\" The translation in a footnote to that page reads: \"Kapitän, ein fremdes (feindliches) Segel.\"\n\nIn one of Ernst Willkomm stories from 1838, Jan, one of the characters in the story shouts \"Ship Ahoy\" as loud as a thunder from the cliffs of Heligoland. This was misprinted as \"ship ahni\" by the German newspaper \"Zeitung für die elegante Welt\" (English: A Newspaper For the Elegant World)\",\" in which Willkomm's Lootsenerzählungen (English: Pilot Stories) first appeared. The misspelling was corrected when the story was published in a book in 1842.With its meaning apparently unknown to the publisher, the word reappeared in the same German newspaper in a narrative called \"Johann Pol\".\"An Image of life in the west\" \"indies\" by an anonymous author in 1838. The said narrative depicts sailors from all around the world chanting \"Ahoi, oi\" while loading the ship.\n\nThe 1844 \"Politik an einer Wirthstafel\" by Friedrich Giehne uses the words 'Waitress, Ahoy' in an expression addressed towards a waitress by a character. The story was published in a book which included mostly reissues of materials printed between 1836 and 1843. However, there was no mention of when the said story was first published or whether or not it was actually a reprint. What is interesting is that the word \"ahoy\" was used on and off the ship. One such example of an off sea usage can be found in Smollet's novel \"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle\" in 1751 in which commodore Trunnion utters \" Ho, the house, Ahoy!\". It is likely however, that Giehne might have borrowed the term from Smollet as he could have read an 1840 translation of Smollet's work by Georg Nikolaus Bärmann from English to German.\n\nIn 1844, The German author Heinrich Smidt used the term \"Ahoy\" in parts of a pre-print version of his novel titled \"Michael de Ruiter\".\"Pictures of Holland's Marine\" which was published in 1846 in the \"Magazine for the Literature from Abroad\" of which he was the editor\".\" The term was also used in another one of his narratives in 1844 titled \"Hexen-Bootsmann.\" There is no trace of \"ahoy\" in the recently digitized versions of Smidt's works originally published between 1837 and 1842, however, the term has a continuous presence in all of his works since 1844 until his last novel which was published in 1866. Therefore, it is likely that Smidt added the word to his vocabulary sometime in 1843. \n\nFriedrich Gerstäcker was one of the most successful and popular German authors of adventure novels in the 19th century. As was the case with Smidt who started using Ahoy in 1844, Gerstäcker, who translated a lot from the English, also suddenly used the term in 1847. \"Ahoi – ho – ahoi! meine braven Burschen\" (English: \"Ahoi – ho – ahoi! My well behaved fellows\"), is what he writes in the \"Mississippi pictures\". In 1848 the sentence: \"Boot ahoi! schrie da plötzlich der gebundene Steuermann\" (English: Ship ahoi! shouted the helmsman\nsuddenly\"), appeared in Gerstäcker’s novel Flusspiraten des Mississippi (English: The Mississippi River Pirates).\n\nFor Wilhelm Heine, a world traveller, the cry was \"common\" in 1859. But Heine was on a voyage with sailors from the United States, who were already using the common English form. For Germans in Livland on the Baltic Sea the use of \"ahoi\" was explained in a dictionary from 1864: \" ahoi [...]. disyllabic, and with stress on the second syllable.\" In the 19th century it was \"all in all rather seldom\" used in Germany. About 1910 it was a \"modern imitation\" of the English \"ahoy\", which later became an uncommon cry. In non-maritime fields \"ahoi\" is also used to say goodbye. In literature, many writers used \"ahoi\" in a mostly maritime context:\n\n\nThe word created a maritime atmosphere in many songs which were composed after the period of the Tall ships, but without the traditional meaning of \"ahoi\". In 1934 the song Wir lagen vor Madagaskar was composed with the first line of the chorus \"Ahoi Kameraden\". This can be seen as a sailors' song. The Pop song \"Schön ist die Liebe im Hafen\" with the final line of the chorus \"Auch nicht mit Fürsten und Grafen / Tauschen wir Jungens, ahoi!\" is based on a waltz, which was also composed in 1934. The Edelweiss Pirates probably adopted \"ahoi\" from Czech teenagers and used it as a greeting even after the group was banned in 1933.\n\nPeople who sail as a hobby adopted ahoi from those who sail as a living. From 1884 to 1887 the publication \"Ahoi!\" initially appeared as \"Zeitschrift für deutsche Segler\" (Magazine for German sailors), later as \"Zeitschrift für den Wassersport\" (Magazine for Watersport)\".\" In 1892 the Berlin sailing club Ahoi was founded. There's evidence of ahoi as a \"sailor's call\" in the area of Lake Constance in the 1920s. With the watersport's increasing popularity it came back into existence in the 1960s. Since then \"ahoi\" is also used as a formal greeting to officials on board, e.g. \"Käptn ahoi!\", or without an additional element. The use is considered by professionals unseamenlike and you should completely avoid the cry (\"ahoi!\"). Its use is severely marked down on board and can destroy the whole level of newly formed, hard-earned trust. This already dying word has been revamped by lyricists once more. A rubber dinghy shipyard distributed from 1964 to 1992 their customer magazine Wiking ahoi (Viking ahoy).\n\n\"Ahoi\", alongside \"helau\" and \"alaaf\", is a word used to make a fool of somebody during the Carnival period. After sailors, stevedores and inland fishermen adopted the expression from the coast, it was made popular by the Carnival societies. During the parades, the crews of the Ships of fools greet the people on the roadside with \"Ahoi!\", and they return the same greeting. It was also traditionally used in the former territory of the Palatinate, in Mannheim as \"Monnem ahoi\" or \"Mannem ahoi!\" and in Ludwigshafen, but also in bordering areas like northern Baden Altlußheim, as well as in southern Thuringian Wasungen, as \"Woesinge ahoi!\". The Carnival society Milka, foundend in 1908 in Upper Swabian Ravensburg, shouts the greeting \"Milka - ahoi!\". During the Backfischfest of the fishermen's guild in Worms, the greeting \"ahoi\" is employed as well. Also newer Carnival groups, for example one northern German association, and a new group in Cologne, refer to this call.\n\nIn the German and Austrian Marines, before World War I, the boats which approached a warship lain at anchor were called using the expression \"Boot ahoi!\", in order to find out who was on board. The answers from the warships depended on the most senior person on board: \"Standarte!\" was the reply if the boat was approaching with a royal on board; \"Flagge!\" with an Admiral; \"Ja, ja!\" with an Officer and \"Nein, nein!\" without any official. It worked in a similar way with \"boat ahoy\" in the U.S. Navy, where the procedure was established for the first time in 1893, and in the Royal Navy. In the German Navy the greeting \"Ahoi\" is no longer used. In its place the Northern German term \"Moin\" is used.\n\nAmongst the German warships between 1815 and 1945 only one motorboat of the Kriegsmarine was called \"Ahoi\". It was adopted in 1940, so it probably already had that name, and it drove on the Kaiser-Wilhelm Canal. In June 1945 the former owner, J. Pieper & Co., took possession of it again. The catapult ship \"Bussard,\" on duty in 1942, was sold in 1947 as USA spoils of war to the Belgian shipping company Heygen in Ghent, and renamed \"Ahoy\".\n\nFrom 1940 to 1943 the Phänomen-Werke Gustav Hiller company manufactured 125cc motor scooters for the German Wehrmacht in Zittau, under the name \"Phänomen Ahoi.\"\n\n\"Nebel - ahoi!\" is used by the ABC-Abwehrtruppe, a defence division of the Bundeswehr, and it belongs officially to the military tradition of the army. The expression originated among the Nebeltruppe, a Wehrmacht brigade group from 1935, whose job it was to create a chemical fog over a battlefield before destroying the target areas with mass fire. The expression originated in a moment of euphoria, after the fog successfully covered its target.\n\nAhoj is the name of a Sherbet brand developed in Stuttgart in 1925. Named after the term \"ahoi\" it has been advertised with the picture of a sailor and a flag since 1930. At this point there was a fashion for Sailor Suits for children. In the USA term is used for the popular cookie brand \"Chips Ahoy!\" produced by Nabisco, a pun on the term \"ships ahoy!\".\n\nIn one particular case \"Åhoi\" is used as an instruction to the cattle to slow down. It was found before World War I in the Ore Mountains and it was used in the same way as \"eha\" and \"oha, ooha(a).\" It is possible that this is a combination of two interjections, as in Middle English, though \"eha\" might come from the typical Ore Mountain form \"eh\" \"ein, inne\", as \"ee halten\" \"an-, ein-, innehalten\". The new standard dictionary for this language area lacks an entry for \"åhoi, ahoi\" or \"oho.\" In a valley in the Slovenian Triglav area shepherds use the call \"Ohoi!\" to communicate over long distances, according to a report from 1838.\n\nIf the origin of \"ahoi\" is rooted in Dutch, then \"hoy\" originates from \"hoie\", which is the name of a sailorboat that today is known as a \"Hoie\" or \"Heude\".\nThis common type of boat was used to transport passengers and cargo \nalong the coast of the North Sea and across the English Channel. In a \nletter from 1495 \"an Hoye of Dorderyght\" from the Dutch trading town \nDordrecht is mentioned. Then, two years later the term \"an hoye of \nAndwarpe\" appears in documents belonging the English King Henry VII. In \nhis travel accounts from 1624 John Smith, who tended to exaggerate, \ncounts an enormous number of sails in the region between Vlissingen and \nthe Sea of IJsselin: \"Holland and Zeeland hath twenty thousand saile of \nShips and Hoies.\"\n\nHowever, there is a lack of direct evidence that links the origin of \"ahoi\" to the particle \"a\" and the noun \"hoie\".\nIn Dutch linguistics the call is thought to be an adaption \nfrom English. This is indicated by the amount of evidence found in \nEnglish and the lack thereof in Dutch, as well as criticism of the idea \nthat in the Early Modern Period a word could be formed from a simple \nexpression for a ship.\n\nThe relation of \"ahoi\" and \"hoi\", which is a common form of address in Dutch, is unclear. \"Hoi\", which had been proven to be an exclamation of joy as early as 1552, could also be a short form of \"ahoi\" or \"ahoi\" could be an extension of \"hoi\". Most likely \"hoi\" belongs to a group of calls such as \"hó\" and \"hé\" and is not closely related to \"ahoi\" at all.\n\n\"Aho(o)i, ahoy\" and \"ehoi\"\nare rather uncommon in Dutch and are not included in numerous \nspecialist dictionaries. This could be due to the prevalence of the \nsimilar and shorter exclamation \"hoi.\"\n\nThe sources for earlier uses of the term are lacking, because \"ahoi\" did not get its own lemma in the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (WNT),\" even though this comprehensive dictionary includes interjections. In addition later editions of the \"WNT\" from recent decades lack this entry. The earliest entries of forms of \"ahoi\" in the \"WNT\"\ncan be found around 1900. The author Tine van Berken wrote \"A-hoi! \nA-hoi! riep Beer onvermoeid, de hand trechters gewijze aan de mond\", \nwhich roughly translates as \"A-hoi! A-hoi! called Beer relentlessly...\",\nin a book for girls that was published in 1897. In 1908 author George \nFrans Haspels wrote \"met donderend ahoei\", \"with thundering ahoy\", \nreferring to the forces of a storm that hit the coast. Here the meaning \nwas extended to refer to noise. If Haspel was alluding to the sound of \nthe wind, the spelling \"ahoei\", which is pronounced [a ˈhuːi], contains an onomatopoeic element.\n\nIn the 1950s \"ahoi\" was considered outdated. However, the expression was still generally known. Evidence for the use of \"ahoy\" in Friesian are lacking in comprehensive dictionaries of that language.\n\n\"Ahoy\" also refers to the short form of the Ahoy Rotterdam, a big conference center in the Netherlands. It originally consisted of only one hall that was used for the exhibition \"Rotterdam Ahoy!\" in the 1950s. The exhibition was held as part of the reconstruction of the city after the war and was originally called \"Ahoy’\",\nthe additional accent is intended to remind the reader of the \nexclamation mark in the name of the exhibition. In 1968 it was moved to \nthe district of Charlois and developed into an extensive complex of buildings over the years.\n\nCharlois is the place of origin of the \"Tamboer- en Trompetterkorps Ahoy,\" the \"Tambour- and Trumpetcorps Ahoy\", founded in 1955. We do not know whether it was called this because the term \"ahoy\" expressed the sense of reconstruction in Rotterdam at the time and was already outdated in a maritime context.\n\nThe marching band first performed on the Koninginnedag\n(Queens' Day) in 1956 and became more popularly known because of their innovative formations, their previously uncommon antiphonal singing and faster marching music. In 1962 they won first prize at the Wereld Muziek Concours in Kerkrade and later played at the Sanremo Music Festival. The group split up in 2003 because of a lack of successors. The \"Show-Musikkorps Ahoy-Hamburg\" was founded in Hamburg in 1975.\n\nScandinavian languages have adopted derivatives of the English form \"ahoy\" and \"ohoy\" in various different spellings. In Danish it is \"ahoj\" and \"ohoj\", also \"ohjø, aahøj\" oder \"ohej\", in Norwegian \"ohoi,\" in Swedish \"ohoj\" and \"å-hoj\". In Icelandic \"ohoj\" can be combined with the English word \"ship\"; which takes the form \"Sjipp og hoj\" (Ship ahoy). This is also used in Norwegian, as \"Skip ohoi\".\n\nIn 1837 the Danish novelist Andreas Nikolai de Saint-Aubain, who published under the pseudonym Carl Bernhard, used the phrase \"‚Ahoi, en Sejler!‘ raabte Matrosen fra Mærset\". In the same year Saint-Aubin's German translation \"‚Ahoi, ein Segler!‘, rief der Matrose vom Mers\", is an example of early evidence in the German-speaking world. The Swedish author Emilie Flygare-Carlén wrote in 1842: \"Örnungen reddes till en ny färd på den klarnade böljan; manskabet skrek sitt muntra ‚å-hoj!‘\" The German translator of 1843 avoided the use of \"å-hoj\"\nand formulated it as such: \"The young eagle was prepared for a new journey through the clear waves; the crew let out its cheerful shout of Hiaho.\" In the English translation of 1844 it was however, \"The crew of the young Eagle […] shouted their cheerful ahoys.\" In 1846 Flygare-Carlén wrote \"Båt, ohoj – hvarifrån, hvathän?\", English \"Ship, ahoy - where from, where to?\" But in English-Danish dictionaries from 1863, \"ahoy\" is given as \"Hey! Holla!\" und \"holla! heida!\"\n\nIn Finnish, a language which does not belong to the Germanic Language Family, the interjection is derived from the Swedish \"ohoj\" and becomes \"ohoi\". In a German-Finnish dictionary \"ahoi\" (German) is written as \"hoi\" (Finnish). A translation from the English \"ahoy\" into the related language of Estonian is called \"ahoi\".\n\nIn the landlocked Czechoslovakia, created from Bohemia, Moravia, part of Silesia and Slovakia in 1918 and then in 1992 split into two independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, ahoj (pronounced [aɦɔj], ) is an everyday greeting. The following explanations are the reason why ahoj is used in this part of Central Europe:\nThe international call which is sometimes accredited to a Bohemian sailor in the 17th century has since been proven to be wrong.\n\nThe spread of \"ahoj\" mainly dates back to the 1920s, when Czech adolescents and students populised canoeing on the South Moravian and Bohemian rivers. The canoers formed a type of movement called Wandervogel, some called themselves \"trampové\", \"Tramps\", or \"skauti\", \"Scouts.\" As early as the 1930s Czech linguists believed the \"skauti\" as the carriers and distributors of the word \"ahoj\".\n\nThese groups formed a romantic opposition against the nationalistic Czech middle-class*. The Sokol movement with its preference for traditional gymnastics did not fit the adolenscent's spirit of optimism and progress, which cultivated an internationally and trendily* perceived sport with its own greeting. They positioned their form of \"ahoj\" from sailors, which possibly coming from the lower parts of Germany, against Sokol's \"nazdar,\" English for \"hail\". \"Nazdar\" was used in general across the Czech and Czechoslovak society, but within a few decades, the modern-day \"ahoj\" replaced this old-fashioned expression.\n\nThe Czech and Slovak ironic love of language contributed to the distribution of \"ahoj\". In Slovakia \"ahoj\"-derivates are used in variety of different scenarios, such as the diminutive \"ahojček\", as a toast \"ahojka\", to a greater extent the plural-form \"ahojte\", as well as the grammatically correct we-form \"ahojme sa\". In Czech as well as in Slovak \"ahoj\" is being slowly replaced by the modern-day form \"čau\", which comes from the Italian greeting \"ciao\". This has been perceived to be the case since the Czechoslovak government allowed the Italian films to be shown in the 1960s.\n\nThe daily newspaper \"České slovo\" (English - Czech Word), which belongs to the publishing company Melantrich in Prague, called a humorous supplement \"Ahoj na neděli\" (English - Ahoy on Sunday), which appeared between 1933 and 1943. It was distributed on every Friday, \"in order to provide the tramps in time with their weekend lecture.\" From 1969 until 1997 the leisure supplement \"Ahoj na sobotu\" (English - Ahoy on Saturday) appeared in \"České slovo\"'s successor \"Svobodné slovo\" (English - Free Word)\".\"\n\nAhoj is the official name of a district in Nové Mesto which is a part of the Slovak capital city Bratislava. Adolescents met there before the Second World War, when the region was barely built.\n\nThe car manufacturer Skoda called its prototype for a city car \"Škoda Ahoj!\" in 2001.\n\nIn Theresienstadt concentration camp Czech-speaking Jews called jokingly non-believing inmates, who had assimilated to the Czech society, \"Ahojista\", (English - \"ahoy-ers\"). A Jewish, Czech, who had assimilated and posed opportunistically as a Zionist for the camp's Jewish administration centre, was called \"Šahojista,\" which was composed of the greetings \"Schalom\" and \"Ahoj\".\n\nAcronyms\nWhen Czechoslovakia, called the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, was occupied by Germany in the 1930s ahoj could be understood as an acronym for the watchword \"Adolfa Hitlera oběsíme jistě\", English - \"We'll hang Adolf Hitler for sure.\" Under the communist government ahoj developed into an acronym in the Slovak part of the country. Since the struggle between the Church and the State from 1950 it was used as an acronym to console people in hardship \"Aj hriešnych ochraňuje ježiš,\" English \"Jesus also protects the sinners\", or for the Latin \"ad honorem jesu,\" English \"For the glory of Jesus\". Demonstratively catholic adolescents use it amongst themselves. Even priests used it to address the congregation from the pulpit.\n\nA recent resurgence in the popularity of the term has resulted from its use by \"The Simpsons\" character Montgomery Burns, who often answers the telephone with the greeting of \"Ahoy-hoy.\" The use of the now-defunct ahoy-hoy, instead of the standard \"hello\", is a running joke referring to Mr. Burns' very advanced age.\n\nLyrics to \"Solid Potato Salad\" performed by the Ross Sisters in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Technicolor musical film \"Broadway Rhythm\" in 1944 include the words \"Hoy hoy\" \n\nCzechoslovak cartoon character Mole also often used the greeting ahoj, popularizing it amongst children in Hungary, Poland, Russia, Belarus, East and West Germany, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Spain, China, Japan, and India from the 1960s to the early 2000s.\n\nIn the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\" season 5 episode 08, Sheldon answers the phone saying Ahoy after he explains to his roommate that Alexander Graham Bell proposed answering that way.\n\nAustralian radio duo Hamish and Andy use \"ahoy\" as the preferred telephonic greeting on their daily radio show. After learning of Alexander Graham Bell's wish for the word to be used over the phone, the pair implemented the policy on their show. Listeners are encouraged to greet the duo with \"ahoy\" when they ring the show.\n\n"}

{"id": "24550677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24550677", "title": "Mazamorra", "text": "Mazamorra\n\nMazamorra (from Spanish Arabic \"pičmáṭ\" from Greek \"paxamádion\", and from the Greek mâza) is the name for numerous traditional dishes from Córdoba, Andalusia and Latin America. The origin of the recipe differs for every dish.\n\nIn Argentina, mazamorra is a traditional dish. It is a dessert with native roots made with white maize, water, sugar, and vanilla. A variant, which is the most consumed in the country, is mazamorra with milk. In this recipe, milk is added to the previous ingredients.\n\nMazamorra is usually made with the same boiled maize used to make locro.\n\nAs locro, it's common to eat mazamorra on national holidays, like 25 de mayo and independence day.\n\nInitially, mazamorra was the stew which fed \"galeotes\" (the rowers, almost always forced, in the ships called \"galeras\") and sailors. The dish consisted of any available vegetables, most often peppers, lentils and chickpeas, cooked together. In central Colombia, there is still a type of vegetable stew with this name.\n\nToday, however, mazamorra is more commonly a corn-based beverage, with different presentations in various parts of the country. For many Colombian speakers, it is simply very-well-cooked peeled corn, also known as peto. Its texture and appearance vary depending on the region, but usually mazamorra has a white or yellow appearance according to the maize that is used; its texture is generally soft and mushy.\n\nIn Antioquia, it often accompanies panela and is a very popular side dish to meals such as bandeja paisa. The drink typically includes maize grains, crushed with mortar and pestle, then soaked in water with soda lye (although the traditional reagent used is fern ash, which contains high amounts of potassium carbonate), and finally cooked until soft. \nMazamorra is very common during lunch and dinnertime at any time of year. The mazamorra is a typical Colombian food that is served as an accompaniment or as a main dish, whether familiar or casual.\nIt is usually sold as \"street food”.\n\nIn Cundinamarca and Boyacá, where the corn is cooked with onions, coriander, garlic, faba beans, potatoes and mashuas, often with pieces of ribs or beef. This dish is known as \"mazamorra chiquita\" (small mazamorra).\n\nAlso known as \"kaguyjy\" in Guaraní, Mazamorra in Paraguay is made with the native \"\"locro\"\" variety of maize. It is one of the most traditional desserts of the country. According with the ingredients added to the cooked corn, the dish is denominated \"kaguyjy eírare\" (Honey mazamorra), \"kaaguyjy kambýre\" (milk mazamorra) or \"kaguyjy azucáre\" (sugar mazamorra). Kaguyjy reached great popularity in Paraguay due to the food scarcity during the Paraguayan War (between 1864 and 1870) as a nutritious substitute for a regular meal.\n\nMazamorra in Peru is made with a local variety of Maize, purple corn, rich in anthocyanin which gives the mazamorra a deep purple color. The maize is cooked with pineapple, cinnamon and sweet potato flour. This dish is made specially in October for the celebrations of the Lord of Miracles day 333. This purple corn is also used to make chicha morada, a sweet beverage.\n\nCosta Rican mazamorra is basically a corn porridge, which is made cooking the maize in milk, clove, vanilla, and adding corn starch.\n\nDominican mazamorra which they call majarete is a fresh corn custard. Fresh corn is cut off the cob and boiled with milk and cob until the corn softens. Once soft the cob is discarded and corn is put into a blender with the milk it has been boiling in. Once made into a paste the corn is passed through a chinois back into the pot for a second time. The liquid is then cooked with corn starch, butter, coconut milk, evaporated milk, clove, cinnamon, anise, vanilla, lime peel and sugar. The majarete is then topped with powdered nutmeg and a stick of cinnamon.\n\nCordobense mazamorra is a traditional dish made of almonds, bread, garlic, oil and vinegar.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24559497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24559497", "title": "Meat on the bone", "text": "Meat on the bone\n\nMeat on the bone, also called bone-in meat is meat that is sold with some or all of the bones included in the cut or portion, i.e. meat that has not been filleted. The phrase \"on the bone\" can also be applied to specific types of meat, most commonly ham on the bone, and to fish. Meat or fish on the bone may be cooked and served with the bones still included or the bones may be removed at some stage in the preparation.\n\nExamples of meat on the bone include T-bone steaks, chops, spare ribs, chicken leg portions and whole chicken. Examples of fish on the bone include unfilleted plaice and some cuts of salmon.\n\nMeat on the bone is used in many traditional recipes.\n\nThe principal effect of cooking meat on the bone is that it alters the flavour and texture. Albumen and collagen in the bones release gelatin when boiled which adds substance to stews, stocks, soups and sauces. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking.\n\nConsumption methods vary by size; smaller bones can be eaten whole, while larger ones can be broken or gnawed.\n\nSome meat on the bone is most commonly eaten by picking it up, notably ribs and chicken (wings, drumstick, sometimes thigh). Others are primarily eaten by cutting off the meat, such as steaks, but possibly picking up and gnawing the bone when otherwise finished.\n\nSmaller fish are often eaten whole, with the bones. Examples include whitebait of all sorts, anchovies, and smelt. \n\nIn some cases the bone marrow may also be eaten, notably for beef or poultry (especially chicken), in the later case by the eater breaking or chewing off the end of a soft leg bone and sucking the marrow out.\n\nMeat on the bone typically cooks slower than boneless meat when roasted in a joint. Individual bone-in portions such as chops also take longer to cook than their filleted equivalents.\n\nMeat on the bone is quicker and easier to butcher as there is no filleting involved. Filleting is a skilled process that adds to labour and wastage costs as meat remaining on the bones after filleting is of low value (although it can be recovered). As a result, meat on the bone can be better value for money. However, relative value can be hard to judge as the bone part of the product is inedible. Various portions may contain a greater or lesser proportion of bone.\n\nThe presence of bones may make meat products more bulky, irregular in shape, and difficult to pack. Bones may make preparation and carving more difficult. However, bones can sometimes be used as handles to make the meat easier to eat.\n\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a contagious disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health.\n\nFMD can be contracted by contact with infected meat, with meat on the bone representing a higher risk than filleted meat. As a result, import of meat on the bone remains more restricted than that of filleted meat in many countries.\n\nMeat and fish served on the bone can present a risk of accident or injury. Small, sharp fish bones are the most likely to cause injury although sharp fragments of meat bone can also cause problems. Typical injuries include bones being swallowed and becoming trapped in the throat and bones being trapped under the tongue.\n\nDiscarded bones can also present a risk of injury to pets or wild animals as some types of cooked meat bone break into sharp fragments when chewed.\n\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as \"mad cow disease\", is a fatal brain disease affecting cattle. It is believed by most scientists that the disease may be transmitted to human beings who eat the brain or spinal cord of infected carcasses.<ref name=\"FDA/CFSAN\">\n</ref> In humans, it is known as \"new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease\" (vCJD or nvCJD), and is also fatal.\n\nThe largest outbreak of BSE was in the United Kingdom, with several other countries affected to a lesser extent. The outbreak started in 1984, and continued into the 1990s, leading to increasing concern among governments and beef consumers as the risk to humans became known, but could not be quantified. Many countries banned or restricted the import of beef products from countries affected by BSE.\n\nAnimal brain and spinal cord had already been removed from the human and animal food chain when, in 1997, prion infection was also detected in the dorsal root ganglia within the spinal column of infected animals. As a result, beef on the bone was banned from sale in the UK as a precaution. This led to criticism that the government was overreacting. The European Union also considered banning beef and lamb on the bone. The UK ban lasted from December 1997 to December 1999, when it was lifted and the risk from beef on the bone declared negligible.\n\nThe phrase \"meat on the bones\" is used metaphorically to mean substance. For example, \"\"I expect that we'll start putting some meat on the bones of regulatory reform\"\" indicates an intention to add detail and substance to plans for regulatory reform and implies that these plans were previously only set out in broad or vague terms.\n\nThe phrase to \"flesh out\" relies of the same imagery in which a basic idea is likened to a skeleton or bones and the specific details of the idea to meat or flesh on that skeleton.\n"}

Sites were located in Kansas and Missouri around the mouth of the Kansas River where it enters the Missouri River. There are 30 recorded Kansas City Hopewell sites.\n\nThe sites are made up of distinctive pottery styles and impressive burial mounds containing stone vault tombs. It is however uncertain whether this culture developed locally when people adopted Hopewell traits, or if westward migrating Hopewell people brought it all with them.\n\nThe Hopewell Exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois river valleys about 300 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, as has been found by the evidence of goods such as obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast in locations distant from their origins.\n\nThe Kansas City Hopewell period is divided by archaeologists into three phases based on radiocarbon dates and changes in projectile point styles and ceramic decoration. \nThe Kansas City Hopewell peoples grew a variety of domesticated plants, including squash and marsh elder. The majority of their diet seems to have come from wild resources such as seeds, nuts, deer, raccoon, and turkey. Their exploitation of the resources of the oak-hickory forest allowed them to establish permanent villages.\n\nThe Renner Village Archeological Site in Riverside, Missouri is one of several sites near the junction of Line Creek and the Missouri River. The site contains Hopewell and Middle Mississippian remains. The Trowbridge site near Kansas City is close to the western limit of the Hopewell. \"Hopewell\"-style pottery and stone tools, typical of the Illinois and Ohio river valleys, are abundant at the Trowbridge site, and decorated Hopewell style pottery rarely appears further west. \n\nThe Cloverdale archaeological site is situated at the mouth of a small valley that opens into the Missouri River Valley, near St.Joseph, Missouri. It is a multi-component site with Kansas City Hopewell (ca. 100 to 500 CE) and Steed Kisker (ca. 1200 CE) occupation. After 500 CE until about 1000 CE, the (Late Woodland period), the Kansas City Hopewell culture changed and evolved into different cultures. The people of this period started to live in small hamlets with two to three families and began to rely on more on agriculture.

However, some cooks leave it all in for the diners to pick out as they eat, similar to many Caribbean meat and rice dishes.

{"id": "24748069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24748069", "title": "Hot chicken", "text": "Hot chicken\n\nHot chicken or Nashville hot chicken is a type of fried chicken that is a local specialty of Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States. In its typical preparation, it is a portion of breast, thigh, or wing that has been marinated in a water-based blend of seasoning, floured, fried, and finally sauced using a paste that has been spiced with cayenne pepper. It is served atop slices of white bread with pickle chips. It is both the application of a spicy paste and the presentation that differentiates it from similar dishes, such as Buffalo wings. It can be viewed in similar context to other foods that have been tweaked to be unique in a regional way, such as the slugburger or the Mississippi Delta tamale.\n\nThere are many restaurants in Nashville that serve a variant of the dish, and there is a citywide festival and competition celebrating it. The popularity of hot chicken has spread beyond the Southern United States due to the influence of Nashville's music industry.\n\nAlthough the components of the dish largely remain the same, the preparation of the dish can differ greatly. A pressure fryer or deep fryer can be used, although most restaurants serve a pan-fried product. Nearly all hot chicken is marinated in buttermilk to impart flavor and to retain the meat's juices upon frying. Some preparations of hot chicken are breaded and fried after application of the spice paste; the more traditional method has the paste applied immediately after the chicken is removed from the fryer.\n\nA typical Nashville-style hot chicken spice paste has two key ingredients: lard and cayenne pepper. The two are mixed together, three parts pepper to one part lard, and heated until they form a thick sauce. Some restaurants vary the composition of the paste, adding sugar, garlic, or additional hot sauce. The paste is applied to the fried chicken by the server using a spoon and latex gloves; it is lightly squeezed into the finished chicken by hand. The heat level of the chicken can be varied by the preparer by reducing or increasing the amount of paste applied.\n\nThe main variation to traditional hot chicken is in the application of the spice paste: before breading or after breading, and whether or not additional spices are applied. Recipes, cooking methods, and preparation steps for hot chicken are often closely guarded secrets, proprietary to the specific restaurant, so the appearance of the chicken may vary widely.\n\nA variation of the hot chicken theme is hot fish, typically a breaded and fried whiting or catfish filet prepared using a similar cayenne paste as hot chicken, or using a cayenne powder blend sprinkled liberally over the filet. Some hot chicken restaurants also serve hot fish, but recently some have begun to specialize in hot fish only.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that spicy fried chicken has been served in Nashville's African-American communities for generations. The current dish may have been introduced as early as the 1930s; however, the current style of spice paste may only date back to the mid-1970s. It is generally accepted that the originator of hot chicken is the family of Andre Prince Jeffries, owner of Prince's Hot Chicken Shack. She has operated the restaurant since 1980; before that time, it was owned by her great-uncle, Thornton Prince III. Although impossible to verify, Jeffries says the development of hot chicken was an accident. Her great-uncle Thornton was purportedly a womanizer, and after a particularly late night out his girlfriend at the time cooked him a fried chicken breakfast with extra pepper as revenge. Instead, Thornton decided he liked it so much that, by the mid-1930s, he and his brothers had created their own recipe and opened the BBQ Chicken Shack café.\n\nWhat began as breakfast revenge is now considered to be a staple food for late-night diners. On weekends, most restaurants dedicated to hot chicken are open very late (some past 4 am). , there are an estimated two dozen restaurants in the Nashville area that serve hot chicken, either as the focus or as part of a larger menu. For a time, country music stars Lorrie Morgan and Sammy Kershaw owned and operated a now-defunct hot chicken restaurant called \"hotchickens.com\". The former mayor of Nashville Bill Purcell is a devoted fan, sponsoring the Music City Hot Chicken Festival and giving numerous interviews touting the dish. While in office, he frequently referred to his table at Prince's Hot Chicken as his \"second office\".\n\nReflecting the growing popularity of the dish, several cities in the United States host restaurants that serve hot chicken or a variation thereof, including Atlanta, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Birmingham, Louisville, Ann Arbor, and Columbus. The appeal of hot chicken has spread beyond the United States, with restaurants in Seoul, South Korea, and Melbourne, Australia, also serving this style of chicken.\n\nIn January 2016, fast food chain KFC began selling \"Nashville Hot Chicken\" and \"Nashville Hot Tenders\" in its U.S. restaurants. This follows a trial run in the Pittsburgh area that it stated was \"the most successful product testing in the company's recent history.\" Following this, KFC released \"Nashville Hot Chicken\" in its UK restaurants for a limited run between May 22 and June 18, 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

It is especially associated with the 17th and 18th centuries and was almost exclusively focused on the religious art of the Catholic Church in the country. Characterized by a mastery of the realistic and by the degree to which indigenous beliefs and artistic traditions are evident, these productions were among of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito. Such was the prestige of the movement even in Europe that it was said that King Carlos III of Spain (1716–1788), referring to one of its sculptors in particular, opined: \"I am not concerned that Italy has Michelangelo; in my colonies of America I have the master Caspicara\".\n\nThe Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest Jodoco Ricke, who together with Friar Pedro Bedon transformed the San Andrés seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (\"mestizaje\") and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.\n\nAs a product of cultural syncretism and miscegenation, the works of the Quito School are characterized by the combination and adaptation of European and Indigenous features. In its development, it reflected the styles prevailing in each period of Spain and thus contains renaissance and mannerist elements. During its height, it was eminently baroque, concluding with a short rococo period leading to an incipient neoclassicism until the transition to the republican period. The Quito School also incorporated Flemish, Italian, and Moorish influences.\n\nOne of the common characteristics of the school is the technique of \"encarnado\" (\"flesh-colored\") — the simulation of the color of the flesh of the (European) human body — that makes the skin of sculptures appear more natural. Once the piece was perfectly cut and sanded, an artisan covered the wood with several layers of gesso with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure).\n\nOther typical characteristics include:\n\nThe features indicating its indigenous roots include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

To be a \"hart\" was its fully mature state. A lord would want to hunt not just any deer, but a mature stag in good condition, partly for the extra meat and fat it would carry, but also for prestige. Hence a hart could be designated \"a hart of grease\", (a fat stag), \"a hart of ten\", (a stag with ten points on its antlers) or \"a royal hart\" (a stag which had been hunted by a royal personage). A stag which was old enough to be hunted was called a \"warrantable\" stag.\n\nThe hart was a \"beast of venery\" representing the most prestigious form of hunting, as distinct from lesser \"beasts of the chase\", and \"beasts of warren\", the last of which were regarded virtually as vermin. The membership of these different classes varies somewhat, according to which period, and which writer, is being considered, but the red deer is always in the first class, the fox hardly being regarded at all. Like the fallow deer buck and the wild boar, the hart was normally sought out or \"harboured\" by a \"limer\", or bloodhound hunting on a leash, which would track it from its droppings or footprints to where it was browsing. The huntsman would then report back to his lord and the hunting party would come bringing a pack of raches. These scent hounds would \"unharbour\" the hart and chase it on its hot scent until it was brought to bay.\n\nThe word \"hart\" is not now widely used, but Shakespeare makes several references (for example in \"Twelfth Night\"), punning on the homophones \"hart\" and \"heart\". The word is used several times in \"The Hobbit\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, when Bilbo Baggins and company pass through Mirkwood Forest. It is alluded to in the Joss Whedon series \"Angel\": the senior partners of law firm Wolfram & Hart are represented, respectively by the wolf, the ram and the hart. \"The White Hart\", a personal emblem of Richard II, and \"The Red Hart\" remain common English pub names. \"White Hart Lane\" was the name of the stadium of Tottenham Hotspur F.C., currently of the English Premier League. The county Hertfordshire (along with Hertford, its county town, Hartford, its twin town in Connecticut and the village of Hartford, near Northwich, in Cheshire) is thought to be named after a place where deer forded a watercourse. There is also the district of Hart in Hampshire and the villages of Hartfield at the edge of Ashdown Forest in East Sussex and Hart Common on the outskirts of Westhoughton, in Greater Manchester, and the town of Hartlepool in County Durham. Whinfell Forest once contained a landmark tree called Harthorn. The surnames Hart and Hartley (\"wood of the hart\") also derive from the animal.\n\nIt appears in the first line of Psalm 42 in the King James Authorized Version (1604–1611) of the Psalms: \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\" Tate and Brady's (1696) metrical psalms, among others, also use this figure: \"As pants the hart for cooling streams\" for its common meter (CM) rendering of the Psalm 42 text.\n\n"}

Participation in the form of passacaglia (processions) and \"correfocs\" is an essential part of celebrations in many towns and cities.\n\nThe origin of the \"ball de diables\" is uncertain, but they are believed to have come from medieval street theater, passed down through the oral tradition, evolving in the process.\n\nThough the \"ball de diables\" is popularly known as a dance, it is more appropriately an entremés since the performance was presented in between the entrees of the nobility in the Middle Ages. \n\nThe theme of \"ball de diables\" is a theatrical representation of the struggle between the good and the evil. In its scenic context, it has been used mainly for Corpus Christi festivities, in ecclesiastic processions as accompaniment to provide a more ceremonious and spectacular aspect. The demons used to lead a procession to announce its arrival make a racket. They used loud noise they used to clear a path through the public for the procession. \n\nThe figure of the devil or little devil is in all the spoken dances. It has no relationship with the play represented, but makes the audience laugh with its stunts. At the end of the play satiric verses are recited that are related to the political or public life of the local area and that everyone awaits with delight.\n\nThis could have been the origin of the \"ball de diables\". Starting from a character that each time was taking more prominence and exceeding the importance of the original play, and as a result the devil part became the most popular one.\n\nThe first written account of a \"ball de diables\", according to Joan Amades, was in 1150. The act was represented at the banquet of the wedding of the Barcelona count, Ramon Berenguer IV with the princess Petronilla, daughter of the king of Aragon and Catalonia.

It is then sweetened and colored with beet sugar molasses, and flavored with salt and spices, of which the coriander seed is required, and caraway is optional, but still quite popular.\n\nA Borodinsky variety called ”supreme” consists of 100% rye (85% whole rye and 15% white rye flour) exists accordinf to a pre-GOST recipe found in P.M. Plotnikov & M.F. Kolesnikov's 1940 book \"350 Varieties of Bread\".\n\nSeveral legend exist regarding the etymology. The most popular one states that this bread traces its name to Margarita Tuchkova, a widow of Napoleonic Wars general Alexander Tuchkov, who perished at Battle of Borodino. His widow established a convent at a former battlefield, an abbess of which she eventually became, and its nuns had reportedly come up with the bread's recipe to serve at mourning events, thus, a dark, solemn color, and with round coriander seeds representing a deadly grapeshot. \n\nAnother legend that also ties it to the Battle of Borodino mentions a food trailer containing caraway and rye flour that got blasted by a canon, forcing the locals to recover the ingredients and use them together for the first time.\n\nA third version states that composer and chemist Alexander Borodin brought the idea for the bread to Moscow from Italy where he got interested in local baking. Since rye was not widely cultivated in Southern Europe, this is the most easily dismissed version.\n\nNo sources support these legends, and the name of this bread most probably first appeared after the October Revolution (1917), as no mention of this name was made before 1920. In fact, the modern recipe did not appear in print before 1933, first in internal memos of a Moscow baking plant. However, in the literature of breadbaking of the end of 19th century, a number of similar recipes exist, though caraway seeds were usually used instead of coriander.\n\n\nGOST 5309-50 standard document (in Russian)\n"}

They are usually available in two different shapes (shot and grit) that address different industrial applications.\n\nSteel shot refers to spherical grains made of molten steel through an atomization (\"granulation\") process, available in different sizes and hardnesses.\n\nSteel grit characterizes grains with a predominantly angular shape. These grains are obtained by crushing steel shot, therefore they exhibit sharp edges and broken sections. Harder than steel shot, it is also available in different sizes and hardnesses.\n\nMost steel abrasives are made of a high-carbon steel composition, the best compromise between mechanical properties, efficiency and durability. The most important properties for steel abrasives are hardness, grain size and shape, toughness and cleanliness (lack of oxides, contaminants, etc.).\n\nThe recyclability of steel shot and grit ranges between 2000 and 3000 cycles. Due to its high recyclability level, steel shot and grit tend to generate less waste when compared to other expendable abrasives.\n\nSteel shot or grit is usually available at different hardness levels, ranging between 40 and 65 on the Rockwell scale (400 to 850 on the Vickers hardness scale).\n\nSteel shot and grit are used in cleaning applications for removal of loose material on metal surfaces. This type of cleaning is common in automotive industry (motor blocks, cylinder heads, etc.).\n\nSurface preparation is a series of operations including cleaning and physical modification of a surface. Steel shot and grit are used in surface preparation process for cleaning metal surfaces which are covered with mill scale, dirt, rust, or paint coatings and for physically modifying the metal surface such as creating roughness for better application of paint and coating. The steel shots are generally employed in shot blasting machines.\n\nSteel grit is used in cutting hard stones, such as granite. The grit is used in large multi-blade frames which cut the blocks of granite into thin slices.\n\nShot peening is the repeated striking of a metal surface by hard shot particles. These multiple impacts produce a deformation on the metal surface but also improve the durability of the metal part. The media used in this application is spherical rather than angular. The reason is that spherical shots are more resistant to the fracture which happens due to the striking impact.\n\nSteel shot and grit address numerous sectors since cleaning, surface preparation or shot peening applications are used by many industries as a part of their construction, renovation or repair processes. The main industrial sectors employing steel abrasives are:\n\n\nThe annual steel abrasive production in the world is estimated to be above 1 million tonnes, the world’s largest producer being Winoa Group (previously known as Wheelabrator Allevard) by production and capacity.\n\n\n"}

It replaced the 1908 Pattern and 1925 Pattern—on which it was based—and was standard issue for British and Commonwealth troops from its introduction in 1937, throughout World War II, and in the post-war period until it was superseded by 58 pattern webbing.\n\nDuring the 1930s the introduction of new weapons such as the Bren light machine gun and the planned mechanisation of the British Army led to the need for the development of a new design for the Army's basic load carrying equipment. The introduction of the weapons with high rates of fire meant that soldiers had a requirement to carry more ammunition than previously, while mechanisation meant that soldiers had to be able to move freely within the confines of their vehicles. The increasingly complex nature of combat and different roles that soldiers and members of the other services were being required to undertake, meant that the new design needed to be flexible, thus it was decided that it would consist of interchangeable components, which could be modified to suit the individual needs of a soldier based on his role.\n\nThe design was confirmed on 8 June 1938 and wide-scale issue began in 1939. Towards the end of World War II, some 37 Webbing was produced in jungle green for troops fighting in the Pacific Theatre, although purpose-made 44 Pattern Webbing was then introduced for the humid jungle conditions, being lighter in weight, quicker drying and rot-proofed. Although 44 Pattern continued in use with the British Army for jungle warfare in its various post-World War II colonial conflicts, it did not replace 37 Pattern in general service, which was in use up until the introduction of 58 Pattern. However, 37 Pattern was used for second line and support troops such as the RAMC into the early 70s. It was used by the JLR RCT into the '80s and was issued to Cadets in the 1990s.\n\n1937 Pattern Webbing was made from cotton webbing, which was waterproofed and dyed before being woven. The fittings were made of stamped brass—blackened steel post war—and it was produced by various manufacturers. It was produced in a khaki colour for the Army, which could then be dyed with Blanco, most often to pea green (a light-green shade) and blue-grey for the Royal Air Force (the latter using the earlier 1925 issue ammunition pouch and holster for their issued revolvers in conjunction with 37 Pattern gear). Military Police had white webbing white.\nStandard components included a belt (issued in sizes Normal and Large), cross straps (called 'braces'), cartridge pouches for .303 ammunition (which gave way to 'universal' pouches to carry ammunition for an array of infantry weapons then in use by the British Army, in addition to grenades), a carrier for the waterbottle and a small pack. The large (1908) pack—intended to be carried in regimental transport except when in full marching order—and entrenching tool carrier were retained from World War I issue, although the later was initially issued in modified form before being reintroduced in 1941. Frogs for the 1907 SMLE and No.4 Rifle bayonets were also issued. Different combinations of these components comprised the 'marching order' and the 'battle order' respectively. In addition various items were issued to be used by officers and often armoured crewmen, such as pouches for binoculars, pistol ammunition and compass (externally the same as that for pistol ammunition but with felt padding inside), as well as a 'valise' side pack and holster for the .38 revolver (a tank crew version with leg strap also existed in two versions).\n\nA number of items were issued which conformed to 37 Pattern in their fittings and materials but were not strictly part of the set, such as a bandolier for Sten magazines as issued to airborne troops and the spare barrel bag and parts wallet for the Bren gun.\n\n\n\nThe system could be used to flexibly mix and match components, but regulations usually had soldiers wear set combinations. \n\n\n\n"}

The ones cut into squares or rectangles are called \"mo-yakgwa\" (angular \"yakgwa\"). Shaped pieces are then slowly deep-fried at a relatively low temperature, around . The deep-fried cookies are then soaked in honey, mixed with cinnamon powder, and dried, which gives the \"yakgwa\" a sweet taste and a soft, moist texture. The treat may also be sprinkled with various topping such as pine nuts or sesame seeds.\n\n"}

It is also found in nearby countries (such as Lithuania, under the name \"Žagarėliai\"). The name is related to \"klen\", the Swedish term for \"slender\", but is originally of Low German origin, which may indicate that the pastry was originally German. It is made from flattened dough cut into small trapezoids. A slit is cut in the middle and then one end pulled through the slit to form a \"knot\". The kleina is then deep-fried in oil or another kind of fat.\n\nIn Scandinavia, klenäter are traditionally eaten around Christmas, most commonly in the southern parts of Sweden, and Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Denmark, the Baltic states, as well as Northern Germany. They may be sprinkled with sugar. Icelandic \"Kleinur\" are a very common everyday pastry, sold in bakeries (singly) and stores (in bags of ten or so) all around the country, and eaten plain.\n\nKlenäter are an old type of pastry and are mentioned in Denmark as early as the 14th century and appearing in Danish and Icelandic cookbooks in the 18th century and 19th century. They are also referenced in a Swedish poem by Anna Maria Lenngren from 1800, called \"Grevinnans besök\" (English: \"The Countess' Visit\"). In the poem, a countess is invited to a dinner party at the home of a pastor, where she is served klenäter as part of the entrée. Klenäter also frequently appear in Christmas stories by famous Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909.\n\nIn Norway, klenäter are known as \"fattigmann\" (English: \"poor man\"), or \"Fattigmannbakkels\" (English: \"poor man pastry\"), because, it was said, the high cost of making the cookies could leave you impoverished (\"fattig\"). Fattigmann tend to be made with cinnamon, cardamom and a dash of cognac as well as the other ingredients listed below.\n\nThey are also eaten in the areas of North America where Scandinavians settled during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nThe dough for klenäter is made from flour, egg yolks, sugar, and margarine or butter. The dough is rolled out and then cut into strips, in Iceland often with a special cutting wheel called a \"kleinujárn\". (A pizza cutter can also be used.) The size may vary, but about long is typical. The uncooked strips are covered with plastic wrap and left to rest for two hours in a cold place. They are then fried in oil or sometimes lard and the dough expands into shape. Traditionally, Icelanders fried \"kleinur\" in sheep tallow, but today oil is typically used.\n\nLemon juice, \"brännvin\" or cognac are optional ingredients in klenäter. Water mixed with acetic acid can be used instead. An alternative type of klenäter is \"smördegsklenätter\" (English: \"puff pastry klenäter\").\n\nKlenäter should be kept in a dry place. The non-fried dough can be preserved in a refrigerator for a week. Klenäter are best served medium-warm and newly baked.\n\n\n"}

Frequently the term relates specifically to catalytic reaction systems where either a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst is present in the reactor. Sometimes a reactor \"per se\" is not present by itself, but rather is integrated into a process, for example in reactive separations vessels, retorts, certain fuel cells, and photocatalytic surfaces. The issue of solvent effects on reaction kinetics is also considered as an integral part.\n\nChemical reaction engineering as a discipline started in the early 1950s under the impulse of researchers at the Shell Amsterdam research center and the university of Delft. The term chemical reaction engineering was apparently coined by J.C. Vlugter while preparing the 1st European Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering which was held in Amsterdam in 1957.\n\nChemical reaction engineering aims at studying and optimizing chemical reactions in order to define the best reactor design. Hence, the interactions of flow phenomena, mass transfer, heat transfer, and reaction kinetics are of prime importance in order to relate reactor performance to feed composition and operating conditions. Although originally applied to the petroleum and petrochemical industries, its general methodology combining reaction chemistry and chemical engineering concepts allows optimization of a variety of systems where modeling or engineering of reactions is needed. Chemical reaction engineering approaches are indeed tailored for the development of new processes and the improvement of existing technologies.\n\n\nThe most important series of symposia are the International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering or ISCRE conferences. These three-day conferences are held every two years, rotating among sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, on a six-year cycle. These conferences bring together for three days distinguished international researchers in reaction engineering, prominent industrial practitioners, and new researchers and students of this multifaceted field. ISCRE symposia are a unique gathering place for reaction engineers where research gains are consolidated and new frontiers explored. The state of the art of various sub-disciplines of reaction engineering is reviewed in a timely manner, and new research initiatives are discussed.\n\nThe ISCRE Board administers two premiere awards in chemical reaction engineering for senior and junior researchers every three years.\n\nIn 1996, the ISCRE Board of Directors established the Neal R. Amundson Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering. This award recognizes a pioneer in the field of Chemical Reaction Engineering who has exerted a major influence on the theory or practice of the field, through originality, creativity, and novelty of concept or application. The award is made every three years at an ISCRE meeting, and consists of a Plaque and a check in the amount of $5000.

The dessert is made from butter, milk, flour, sugar, eggs, and sometimes honey. Recipes call for pan frying (traditionally in lard), re-frying and then baking, or baking straight away. The best-established recipes suggest cooking the butter, milk, and flour in a pan then adding the eggs (whites last) and sprinkling sugar on the mixture before baking. Choux paste is also cooked twice, to prepare the paste and to \"transform it into puffs\". It dates to medieval times and is a cross between a batter and a dough. A cream filling can also be inserted.\n\nThe dessert has been described as \"light tender morsels\" that are \"heavenly\". Another description describes them as a \"cream puff batter that bakes like a popover.

Prior to the Hijra travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca. It was not until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more offensive perspective. Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.\n\nPrior to the Hijra travel, Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca, providing a basis for Islamic pacifist schools of thought such as Sufism and the Ahmadiyya movement. Warfare in defense of the faith has also been part of Muslim history since the time of Muhammad, with violence mentioned in Quranic revelations after his exile from Mecca.\n\nIn the 13th century, Salim Suwari a philosopher in Islam, came up with a peaceful approach to Islam known as the Suwarian tradition.\n\nThe Senegalese sufi sheykh Amadou Bamba (1850–1927) spearheaded a non-violent resistance movement against French colonialism in West Africa. Amadou Bamba repeatedly rejected calls for jihad against the Europeans, preaching hard work, piety and education as the best means to resist the oppression and exploitation of his people.\n\nThe earliest massive non-violent implementation of civil disobedience was brought about by Egyptians against British occupation in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. Zaghloul Pasha, considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, Azhar graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-Cabinet Minister whose leadership brought Muslim and Christian communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of Wafd Party, who started campaigning in 1914, they have achieved independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.\n\nAccording to Margaret Chatterjee, Mahatma Gandhi was influenced by Sufi Islam. She states that Gandhi was acquainted with the Sufi Chishti Order, whose Khanqah gatherings he attended, and was influenced by Sufi values such as humility, selfless devotion, identification with the poor, belief in human brotherhood, the oneness of God, and the concept of Fana. David Hardiman notes that Gandhi's garb was similar that of Sufi pirs and fakirs, which was also noted by Winston Churchill when he compared Gandhi to a fakir. According to Amitabh Pal, Gandhi followed a strand of Hinduism that bore similarities to Sufi Islam. During the Indian independence movement, several Muslim organizations played a key role in nonviolent resistance against British imperialism, including Khān Abdul Ghaffār Khān and his followers, as well as the All-India Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nKhān Abdul Ghaffār Khān (6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988) (), nicknamed Bāchā Khān (Pashto: , lit. \"king of chiefs\") or Pāchā Khān (), was a Pashtun independence activist against the rule of the British Raj. He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition, and a lifelong pacifist and devout Muslim. A close friend of Mohandas Gandhi, Bacha Khan was nicknamed the \"Frontier Gandhi\" in British India. Bacha Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar (\"Servants of God\") movement in 1929, whose success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British Empire against him and his supporters, and they suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement. Khan strongly opposed the All-India Muslim League's demand for the partition of India. When the Indian National Congress declared its acceptance of the partition plan without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders, he felt very sad and told the Congress \"you have thrown us to the wolves.\" After partition, Badshah Khan pledged allegiance to Pakistan and demanded an autonomous \"Pashtunistan\" administrative unit within the country, but he was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was again arrested for his opposition to the One Unit program, under which the government announced to merge the former provinces of West Punjab, Sindh, North-West Frontier Province, Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan, and Baluchistan States Union into one single polity of West Pakistan. Badshah Khan also spent much of the 1960s and 1970s either in jail or in exile. Upon his death in 1988 in Peshawar under house arrest, following his will, he was buried at his house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad, although it was marred by two bomb explosions killing 15 people. Despite the heavy fighting at the time, both sides of the Soviet–Afghan War, the communist army and the mujahideen, declared a ceasefire to allow his burial.\n\nThe Palestinian activist Nafez Assaily has been notable for his bookmobile service in Hebron dubbed \"Library on Wheels for Nonviolence and Peace\", and hailed as a \"creative Muslim exponent of non-violent activism\".\n\nThe First Intifada began in 1987 initially as a nonviolent civil disobedience movement. It consisted of general strikes, boycotts of Israeli Civil Administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products, refusal to pay taxes, refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licenses, graffiti, and barricading. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach to neighborhood committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response even in the face of Israeli state repression.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25069082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25069082", "title": "Urban chicken", "text": "Urban chicken\n\nAn urban chicken or backyard chicken is a chicken kept on a residential lot. Keeping chickens is becoming increasingly popular. The primary reasons for keeping chickens are as pets and for eggs. Some people will sell the eggs for side income.\n\nKeeping chickens in an urban environment is associated with the \"urban agriculture\", sustainability movement, which is the growing practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in or around a village, town or city. According to National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service and experts in backyard agriculture, there are a host of personal benefits associated with urban agriculture and keeping chickens in one's own backyard.\n\nKeeping livestock in cities has been common throughout history and is still practiced in many parts of the world. For example, 50,000 pigs were being kept in Manhattan in 1859. But local ordinances were created to limit this, owing to the noise and smell nuisance, and these were relaxed only in times of war when the urban populace was encouraged to provide food for itself.\n\nUrban relief gardens played an important role in sustaining large populations of Americans during economic depressions. War gardens played an important role in the nationwide effort to help win both World War I and World War II. These victory gardens made gardening a patriotic activity and introduced gardening as an activity for everyone, not just those too poor to buy their own food. Later, in the late 1960s and 1970s, community gardening started to make a comeback as a hobby. Organic gardening, urban animal husbandry, and community farms became popular and many cities around the country started community gardening programs for their residents.\n\nIn Canada and the United States, the raising of chickens on urban, suburban, and small town residential lots has become increasingly popular. For example, in Madison, Wisconsin, citizens formed a group called the \"Chicken Underground\", overturned a ban upon domestic chickens and there are now 81 registered owners. A film titled \"Mad City Chickens\" was made about their campaign. More and more cities that had previously banned urban chickens are removing old regulations or making permits easier to obtain.\n\nPolicies toward keeping chickens vary by country, county, or city. Other cities with urban chicken programs and activists include Halifax, New York City, Portland, Oregon, Seattle and Vancouver.\n\nIn the UK, the keeping of chickens has also grown in popularity with as many as 200,000 households involved. Sales of the fashionable \"Eglu\" hen house increased ten-fold between 2004 and 2009.\n\nCommercial egg production has been associated with salmonella and other disease outbreaks in the United States. Poor sanitation and crowded hen houses have contributed to these problems. Expansion of the poultry industry, fueled by an increased demand for poultry products, has created a demand for high throughout poultry and egg production. The resulting increased poultry population density and the rearing of incompatible poultry species in close proximity have presented major disease challenges. Studies have shown that small scale, backyard chicken keeping/egg production reduces these potential disease risks.\n\nAccording to Mench \"et al.\", although changes in commercial egg production systems are being driven largely by animal welfare concerns, it is clear that other aspects of such changes must be considered to ensure sustainable egg production. Sustainability is a complex topic. Elements of sustainability include economics, environmental effects, human health and safety, and social values in addition to animal welfare. Backyard egg production has been suggested as a solution to sustainable, healthy food supply for families.\n\nWhile there are over 300 different breeds of chickens, most people choose between a select few breeds. Most chicken owners are looking for a high-producing egg layer, cold- and heat-hardy, docile, quiet, non-broody, and aesthetically pleasing chicken breed. Many commercial chickens raised in factories for white eggs are white leghorns. This breed is noisy, but has a very high production of eggs and rarely go broody, and they are not very docile, cold-hardy or aesthetically pleasing. Urban chicken owners often choose a red-sex link hybrid similar to production brown-egg producers (Isa Browns, HyLine Browns), another hybrid among the Red and Black Sex-links, or chickens known as \"heritage breeds,\" including the Rhode Island Red, Barred Rocks, Buff Orpingtons, Brahmas, Wyandottes, etc. These breeds generally fit more of the categories that urban chicken owners are looking for.\n\nMeat chickens are different than egg-laying chickens for urban chicken owners. Chicks sold specifically as meat chickens are sometimes called broiler chickens. As with egg-laying breeds, there is a variety of meat chicken breeds. These chickens are butcher-ready in a short time period after hatching. Some breeds grow to full size in as little as 5 weeks. Other breeds grow for up to 12–14 weeks until the butcher date. Meat chickens provide urban chicken owners the ability to know where their meat is coming from, and how it was raised.\n\nEgg-laying chickens include the two groups, Bantams and Standards. Often raised as pets, Bantams are the smaller variety of chickens that require less space and feed. These smaller chickens provide smaller eggs, but still produce a large quantity of eggs. Standards rage from heavy to light breeds and produce the average sized eggs.\n\nChicken owners need to find a place to purchase chickens. Oftentimes, people purchase chickens at local feed stores, or through a hatchery.\n\nChickens not being raised by a mother hen need assistance from their owner to survive. Chickens are raised in a brooder, which can look like a variety of things. Many individuals create their own brooder out of cardboard, plastic or wood. Different sources identify a variety of different square feet per bird needed, but a rule of thumb can be two square feet per chicken. This number can be lowered when the chick is young, but as they grow they will need at least two square feet per bird. It is important that chicken owners place their brooder in a draft-free place, yet still allow holes in the brooder for ventilation.\n\nChicks require a warm environment. In a brooder, this warm environment is created artificially with a heat lamp. My Pet Chicken recommends a red heat lamp, because a white heat lamp can create a harsh and uncomfortable environment for the baby chicks. During the first week of the chicks' life, a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit is required. The temperature can be decreased by 5 degrees F. each week of the chicks life, until they reach week 6. At week 6, the birds should have enough feathers grown to be moved into their chicken coop. Checking on chicks often is important, as chicks that are too cold will huddle together to attempt to retain warmth, and chicks that are too hot will spread out in the brooder in attempts to cool down. Temperature can be adjusted accordingly by lowering and raising the heat lamp in the chick's brooder. Temperature can also be monitored by the use of a thermometer. Wooden chips are often used in the bottom of the brooder as a bedding.\n\nChicks require different food than adult chickens. Chicks need a mash or dust food so that they are able to digest it without grit. Adult chickens are able to digest grit, which allows them to eat bigger food pellets. Purchasing chick food from a local feed store that is specifically for baby chicks will ensure that all nutritional requirements are being met. There are different types of food for different types of chicks. Chicks that are grown for egg-laying purposes require a lower protein level than chicks that are grown as a source of meat. Chicks should be fed and given water out of containers that ensure the chicks' safety, as some containers can injure the chicks or cause easy drowning.\n\nThere are some common concerns associated with the practice of raising chickens in residential areas, specifically noise, odor, attraction of predators/pests, property values, and health. Most chicken owners say that these myths and misconceptions about chickens and their behavior are central to issues surrounding passage of city ordinances and regulations necessary for the keeping of urban chickens:\n\nBird flu and salmonella are the two biggest concerns to human health. The risk for catching bird flu is low, according to Mark Slifka, Ph. D. Infectious Disease Expert with Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. He states this is especially true if the hens are kept in a closed environment, since they wouldn't be exposed to other birds.\n\nSalmonella is mostly associated with under-cooked chicken meat. People who have weak immune systems, such as the elderly, young children, and those with various medical conditions, are most at risk. Proper sanitation and cooking practices lessen the threat of contracting salmonellosis.\n\nAvian influenza, commonly referred to as \"bird flu\" is spread through contact with the feces of contaminated migratory birds. Since these infected wild birds are currently only in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, there is no possible chance of it spreading to chickens elsewhere.\n\nIn some areas, roosters are banned, and only hens are allowed, and in limited numbers, to prevent problems with noise. Hens are relatively quiet as compared to pet dogs, though hens often vocalize after an egg is laid for a few minutes. The noise level during this squawking period has been measured at around 63 decibels, or about the level of two people talking. Other than post-laying squawking, normal hen sounds are not audible at .\n\nIn Columbia, South Carolina it was argued that leaf blowers were far louder than chickens, that dogs produce more waste than chickens do, so neither of those concerns were a valid reason to keep a ban on them. However, the average chicken defecates upwards of seventy times a day, compared with a dog's two or three times a day, calling into question the veracity of that argument.\nIn 1926 in Oakland, California, the department of public health and safety issued an order to \"put your roosters in a light[-]proof coop, or devise apparatus that will hold the rooster's head down so he can't crow\" in response to complaints about the noise they were making.\n\nOdor concerns can be mitigated somewhat by limiting the number of chickens that a household can own. Unlike large commercial operations, where thousands of chickens are kept in close quarters and thus build up enough ammonia to create a powerful odor, small backyard operations produce proportionately less odor. Although in urban spaces where homes are situated right beside one another, steps must be taken to control odors. These range from regular cleaning to changing out the chicken's bedding. If not properly cared for, odors can become quite strong given close proximity to neighboring homes. The average chicken eliminates waste, on average, every fifteen to twenty minutes; a coop of nine chickens will produce approximately seven hundred (700) defecations per day.\n\nPredators and rodents are already living in urban areas. Wild bird feeders, pet food, gardens, fish ponds, bird baths, trash waiting to be collected all attract raccoons, foxes, rodents and flies. Most modern chicken pens are designed to keep predators away. Rats, however, may be attracted to a yard in which excess chicken food remains on the ground on a regular basis. Chicken owners have found many different ways of protecting chickens from predators without significant impact on the area.\n\nOne of the arguments against allowing backyard hens is that chickens kept within city limits will cause a reduction in property values. There are numerous cities across the country that allow backyard hens. Real estate figures show that property values have been unaffected by the passing of ordinances related to the keeping of urban hens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25096784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25096784", "title": "Japanese Mahjong", "text": "Japanese Mahjong\n\nJapanese Mahjong (Japanese: 麻雀, 麻将 or マージャン; \"mājan\"), also known as Rīchi Mahjong, is a variation of mahjong. While the basic rules to the game are retained, the variation features a unique set of rules such as \"rīchi\" and the use of \"dora\". The main mahjong article contains general terms, but only English and Japanese terms are used here. Terms like \"chow,\" \"pung,\" and \"kong\" are not used in this variation, yet their functions are still used. Instead, they are referred to in Japanese as \"chī\", \"pon\", and \"kan\".\n\nIn 1924, a soldier named Saburo Hirayama brought the game to Japan. In Tokyo, he started a mahjong club, parlor, and school. In the years after, the game dramatically increased in popularity. In this process, the game itself was simplified from the Chinese version. Then later, additional rules were adopted to increase the complexity.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan. As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million mahjong players and about 8,900 mahjong parlors in the country. The parlors did 300 billion yen in sales in 2008. There are several manga and anime devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving mahjong (see \"Media\"). Japanese video arcades have introduced mahjong arcade machines that can be connected to others over the Internet. There are also video game versions of strip mahjong.\n\nIn Japan, there are what are known as \"professional players\", usually members of organizations that compete in internal leagues and external events with other professionals and the general public. There are over 1,000 professionals spread across a half-dozen organizations.\n\nJapanese mahjong is usually played with 136 tiles. The tiles are mixed and then arranged into four walls that are each two stacks high and 17 tiles wide. 26 of the stacks are used to build the players' starting hands, 7 stacks are used to form a dead wall, and the remaining 35 stacks form the playing wall.\n\nThere are 34 different kinds of tiles, with four of each kind. Just like standard mahjong, there are three suits of tiles, \"pin\" (circles), \"sou\" (bamboo) and \"wan\" (characters), and unranked \"tsū\" (honour) tiles. Honour tiles are further divided between Wind tiles and Dragon tiles. Some rules may have red number five tiles which work as \"dora\" that earn more \"han\" value. The flower and season tiles are omitted. Names for suit tiles follow the pattern of [number] + [suit], the numbers being Japanese pronunciations of the corresponding Chinese words.\n\nMany basic rules of mahjong apply to the Japanese variation.\n\nPlayers can make a meld by calling for another player's discard. They reveal the meld on the table and then make their own discard. Calling for another player's discard makes the meld and the hand open. When a winning tile of a closed hand is a discard, the meld including that discard is also considered open, while the hand is still regarded as closed. The calls operate exactly the same as any variation of mahjong, except Japanese terminology is used.\n\nPlayers can make an open sequential meld by calling out \"\"chī\"\" (吃 or チー) using a tile discarded by the left player, who is prior in order. Players place the meld face up on the table, usually on the right side of their hands, with the discard placed sideways at the leftmost position of the meld to indicate which tile was taken from the left's discard pile.\n\nPlayers can make an open meld of the same three tiles by calling out \"\"pon\"\" (碰 or ポン) using a tile discarded by any other player. Players place the meld face up on the table with one of those tiles placed sideways to indicate from whom the discard was taken.\n\nThere are three types of quads and players call out \"\"kan\"\" (槓 or カン) for all of those types. After calling a quad, the next adjacent \"dora\" indicator tile is flipped, and players need to draw a supplemental tile from the end of the dead wall. Depending on the rules, the number of tiles in the dead wall is kept at 14 by reserving the last available tile from the wall, or the number decreases at that time.\n\n\nThe precedence order to pick up a discard when two or more players need the same discard is firstly \"ron\" (winning), secondly \"kan\" or \"pon\", and lastly \"chī\". \"Kan\" and \"pon\" cannot happen at the same time since there are only four of each kind of tile.\n\nWhile the basic rules to mahjong apply with the Japanese variation, an additional, distinct set of rules are applied. (See the rules for Old Hong Kong Mahjong.)\n\n\"Yaku\" are specific combinations of tiles or conditions that yield the value of hands. Unlike many variants, a winning hand consists of four melds requires at least one \"yaku\". When scoring, each \"yaku\" has its own \"han\" value, and the \"han\" works as a doubler. A winning hand needs at least one \"yaku\". \"Yakuman\" is a value for limit hands which are hard to get, and in some variations multiple \"yakuman\" are applied.\n\nDeclaring \"\"rīchi\"\" means declaring a ready hand, and is a kind of \"yaku\". A player may declare ready if a player's hand needs only one tile to complete a legal hand (\"tenpai\"), and the player has not claimed another players' discards to make open melds. When declaring ready, a player can win on a discard even when the hand didn't have a \"yaku\" because ready itself is a \"yaku\". Upon declaring ready, the player must pay a deposit and may no longer change their hand except when forming certain closed quads.\n\nAs a possible rule, a player can choose to reveal their hand to win more points if successful, which is called \"ōpun rīchi\" (open \"rīchi\"). In that case, the player shows only the tiles that are related to waits, or reveals all the tiles in the hand depending on the rules. The declaration increases the \"yaku\" count allowing the player to score extra points.\n\n\"Dora\" (ドラ) is a bonus tile that adds \"han\" value to a hand. Every kind of tile can become a \"dora\" tile. A \"dora\" tile adds the same number of \"han\" value as the number of its corresponding \"\"dora\" indicator\" tiles. \"Dora\" is not counted as \"yaku\", and having it without \"yaku\" does not meet the one \"yaku\" requirement for a winning hand.\n\nAt the start of a hand, the third tile from the back end of the dead wall on the upper stack is flipped and becomes a \"dora\" indicator. Then, its succeeding tile is recognized as \"dora\". For example, if an indicator is a Green dragon (), Red dragons () are counted as \"dora\" by the sequence shown below, in which the Red dragon wraps around to the White dragon ().\n\nThe succeeding order of \"dora\" is as follows:\n\nThe number of \"dora\" indicators increases in the following manner: Each time a player calls a quad, the next adjacent \"dora\" indicator tile is flipped, starting with the fourth tile from the back end. The indicator is flipped immediately after the quad is called, and after that the player draws a supplemental tile for their hand from the back end of the dead wall. The number of indicators increases in that direction, which becomes five if a single player calls four quads, and that is the largest possible number on the upper stack (see \"four quads\").\n\nIn addition, when a player goes out with a declaration of \"rīchi\" (ready hand), the tiles underneath the \"dora\" indicators are flipped after the win and become additional \"dora\" indicators, making their succeeding tiles also counted as \"dora\" which are called \"ura-dora\" (裏ドラ, underneath \"dora\").\n\nIt is said that the name \"dora\" stands for \"dragon,\" although it has nothing to do with dragon tiles in contemporary Japanese mahjong.\n\n\nIn the Japanese scoring system, two factors are considered: the \"han\" value and \"fu\" value. If the \"han\" value is five or more, then the \"fu\" value is still counted but no longer necessary. A winner acquires points based on these values, which correspond to a points-value table.\n\nThere is a distinction between winning from the wall and winning from a discard. When going out, players call out \"\"tsumo\"\" (自摸 or ツモ, self-drawn) or \"\"ron\"\" (栄 or ロン, picking up a discard), and not \"mahjong\". In the case of \"tsumo\", the other three players share the responsibility of paying out points, according to the scoring table. For \"ron\", the player who discarded the tile pays all of the points.\n\nIn many mahjong variants, discards are simply placed in the middle of the table in a disorganized fashion. However, with the Japanese variant, tiles are neatly placed in order of discard in front of each player. In turn, each player accumulates a discard pile, with each hand. Typically, discards are placed in rows of 6 tiles per customary rule. In addition, open calls for \"chii\", \"pon\", and \"kan\" have discard specific rules, by which they must indicate the source and type of discarded tile. This way, a record is maintained for all discarded tiles corresponding to each player. Likewise, game strategy depends on the state of the discards and the players' hands.\n\nIn the sacred discard rules which are also called \"furiten\" (振聴 or フリテン), a winning tile can only be drawn from the wall in the following cases:\nFor all of these rules, if discards are not in the discard piles because they have been called to make open melds, the rules still work for such discards.\n\nIn Japanese mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n\n\nVarious game conditions penalizes players, given the following criteria:\n\nA game ends after the last hand of the last round, which is usually the South (prevailing wind) round.\n\nA game ends when a player's score becomes zero or less, or when it falls below zero depending on the rules. Some rules may allow continued gameplay with a player having a negative point value.\n\nIn the rule of \"win and finish\" (\"agari-yame\", あがりやめ), if the dealer in the last hand of the last round wins, they can select to end the game immediately or to play an additional hand, for instance when they are the top player at the time.\n\nIf the points of the top player are below 30,000 after the last hand of the last round, the game continues into the West round (西場) in some rules. This situation is called \"shānyū\" (西入; entering West). The prevailing wind becomes west. A North round (北場) may come next in the same way. Depending on the rules, it can be followed by an East round again or instead White dragon, Green dragon, Red dragon and East rounds. Any extra round ends as soon as one player has 30,000 points or more.\n\nAt the end of a match, players are often given bonus points or penalties depending on their place (see final points and place).\n\nIn an optional rule called \"yakitori\" (焼き鳥), if one did not win a hand in a match, that player pays a penalty. At the start of a match, each player has a marker called \"yakitori māku (mark)\" (焼き鳥マーク) on the table, and a player flips their own after winning a hand. Chips or coins are also used as substitutes, and they are often removed instead of being flipped.\n\nOften in mahjong parlors across Japan, an additional bonus payment called \"Shūgi\" (祝儀) is given to players who won their hand. For each Shūgi the winning hand has, additional payments are made by either the player who threw the winning tile, or by each player in the case of a self-draw.\nCommon Shūgi are:\n\nThere is a three player version called \"sanma\" (三麻), which eliminates an entire numbered suit and removes the ability to call \"Chi\". \nThere is a two player version called \"Clear Mahjong\" that was created by Noboyuki Fukomoto for the manga \"Ten: Tenhōdōri No Kaidanji\".\nThere is a version for two or three players called \"San Hako Mahjong\" that utilizes different values for Tsumo payments.\n\nThis variant is featured in anime and manga series such as \"Akagi\", \"Saki\" and \"Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku\". A live action series named features the game involving yakuza and gambling, while employing various cheating tactics and techniques.\n\nThe variant is available via online play, notably Tenhou.net and Ron2.jp . In addition, many game consoles port mahjong games, as well as various PC software.\n\nOutside Japan, there are clubs sporadically located across Europe, North America, Asia and South America. There are also tournaments of various sizes, the largest outside of Japan being the World Riichi Championship. Smaller events, such as the European Riichi Championship, as well as a few other tournaments can have attendance numbers of tens of people, sometimes even over 100.\n\n\n"}

It acquires its shape by first being fashioned as warm sugar into flat strips. A strip is then folded back and forth over itself to form a hardened ribboned stick. The sugar is often colored to appear festive, and the candy often has a glossy sheen. It is commonly made with extracts, often of different mint or citrus flavors. It is usually thin enough to melt quickly in the mouth, but because pieces of it are usually larger than bite size, biting into a stick of it causes shattering and shards. Many types of ribbon candies also tend to become sticky easily, usually either due to body warmth from being held, or simply from room temperature and humidity. Because of what some consider to be its pretty appearance, it is often used like decor, put out on display in candy dishes, plates, or apothecary jars. When it is used in this way it tends to end up sticking together if it has been sitting out for an extended period of time.\n\nRibbon candy is a traditional Christmas candy that goes back for centuries in Europe, though it is unclear exactly where the candy was first created.\n\nConfectioners developed the candy as a Christmas decoration for their shops, modeling the wavy form around the candy maker’s thumb. In the 1800s mechanical crimpers were invented to shape the ribbons. Finger-like crimpers simulated the curl originally put into the candy by hand. A candy maker made the candy, another spun off a ribbon and fed it into a crimper which was then turned by hand. Finally, the curly ribbon was cut with scissors as it came down a small conveyor.\n\nMechanical crimpers worked well, but the process was slow and very labor-intensive. As demand increased for ribbon candy, it became clear that another way to make the candy had to be found. Until the 1940s ribbon candy was never made on a large scale, because more sophisticated equipment was needed. A single spinning roll was developed and it was found that by very careful tending of the candy batch, the hand spinner could be eliminated and the automated machine could run faster. The big bottleneck was in having to cut the candy with scissors. An air activated automatic cutter was invented by Sevigny Candy and is still in use today by F. B. Washburn Candy, which purchased Sevigny Candy in June 1986. The Brockton, Massachusetts-based F. B. Washburn Candy company is now the primary source for ribbon candy in the US and Canada.\n\nRibbon candy became a Christmas tradition all over the New England area and has now spread throughout the country.\n"}

Often compared to cheese fondue, it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.\nTypical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices. It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving. This may be done at the table, especially if finished with a flambé: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flambéed, the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings.\n\n\"Queso flameado\" is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, as a campfire dish.\nIn Tex-Mex restaurants, this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso, a cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping. The term \"queso fundido\" also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius.\n\nBoth the cheese and the meat sauce are prepared just before serving, and are served hot.

Some consider stringy cheese to be an essential part of this dish, but if this quality is not desired then a fresh farmer's cheese or goat cheese is a good alternative. If fresh chorizo is not available, pieces of dry chorizo or another sausage may be used. Common additions are strips of roasted chiles and sautéed mushrooms.

Tula pryaniki) is a famous type of imprinted Russian pryanik from the city of Tula. Usually, Tula pryanik looks like a rectangular tile or a flat figure. Making stamped pryanik is considered an art form. The imprints could include different patterns, symbols, images of the Tula Kremlin, names, congratulations.\n\nThe cooking of the Tula pryanik starts with preparation of the dough. The dough is made from rye flour, honey, eggs, water and spices. Next the dough is cut into pieces and rolled out. Each piece is placed on a special board with a carved pattern to give the dough its intended form. The first layer of the dough is covered with a second one with a filling in between. To make the two layers stay in place the edges are pressed together. Then the cake is turned over so that the stamped image is on top and the surface is glazed with sugar syrup. The syrup covers the picture to make it more visible after baking. Historically, each carved board is used to create just one design for pryanik. A new board is made specifically for each design. In the past, pryanik boards were made by craftsmen, and nowadays, new designs are created mostly by professional artists.\n\nModern Tula pryaniki typically have a jam or condensed milk filling, while the traditional ingredient in the dough is honey which is sometimes replaced with sugar.\n\nPryaniki have been made in Tula since the 17th century. The first mention of Tula pryanik is in the Tula census book of 1685. Today, Tula pryaniki are made at the confectionery factories of Staraya Tula (Russian for \"Old Tula\") and Yasnaya Polyana and by several smaller companies.\nIn 1996 Tula opened a museum dedicated to its pryaniki.\n\n"}

They are similar in shape to vadai, but are not savoury and are eaten as a dessert.\n\nAdhirasam is a popular as an offering to the gods during puja prayers, both at home and in temples in Tamil Nadu. \n\nAccording to inscriptions from the 16th century Vijayanagara emporer Krishnadevaraya's time, the sweet was made from rice flour, jaggery, butter and pepper. At the annual festival at the Panchavarnesvar Temple in Nallur (located near Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu), an offering of 6000 Adhirasams along with 6000 vadas is made to the Gods; the entire lot is cooked in the temple kitchen between sunrise and 11 pm, for the prayers that take place at midnight. It is most common Diwali sweet preparation for Tamilians.\n\nThe authentic preparation takes about a week. First the rice is soaked in water and dried in shade and ground into a fine powder when the rice is 3/4th dried and retains some moisture. For adding sweet \"vellam\" (jaggery)is melted in water by boiling it till it reaches 'soft ball' consistency (235° F–240° F, if using a candy thermometer) and added to the rice flour along with some powdered cardamom to make a thick dough. It is then transferred to an earthenware pot and the top of the pot is closed with a thin white cloth. It is then allowed to ferment for about 3–5 days by placing it in the sunlight during the day time. Finally when the batter is ready for preparation, small balls of the dough is taken and flattened using fingers in a small piece of oil brushed banana leaf and deep fried in oil until golden brown. Then it is pressed with a flat bottomed bowl to remove the excess oil.\n\n"}
{"id": "25166391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25166391", "title": "Turkish delight", "text": "Turkish delight\n\nTurkish delight or lokum is a family of confections based on a gel of starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are often flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon. The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or powdered cream of tartar, to prevent clinging. Other common flavors include cinnamon and mint. In the production process, soapwort may be used as an emulsifying additive.\n\nThe origin of the confection is not well established, but it is known to have been produced in Turkey as early as the late 1700s, hence its name.\n\nIn the Iraqi cuisine there is a candy similar to Lukum, made from ground fruits called \"Luzina\".\n\nThe exact origin of these sweets is yet to be definitively determined; however, the word \"lokum\" comes from the Arabic \"al-halkum\". In the Arab world, Turkish delights are called \"rāḥat al-ḥulqūm\" (رَاحَة الْحُلْقُوم) which means \"throat comfort\".\n\nAccording to the Hacı Bekir company, Bekir Efendi, named Hacı Bekir after performing the Hajj, moved to Istanbul from his hometown Kastamonu and opened his confectionery shop in the district of Bahçekapı in 1777. He produced various kinds of candies and \"lokums\", later including a unique form of \"lokum\" made with starch and sugar. The family business, now in its fifth generation, still operates under the founder's name.\n\nTim Richardson, a historian of sweets, has questioned the popular attribution of Hacı Bekir as the inventor of Turkish Delight, writing that \"specific names and dates are often erroneously associated with the invention of particular sweets, not least for commercial reasons\". Similar Arab and Persian recipes, including the use of starch and sugar, predate Bekir by several centuries. The Oxford Companion to Food states that although Bekir is often credited with the invention, there is no hard evidence for it.\n\nThe Turkish names \"lokma\" and \"lokum\" are derived from the Arabic word \"luqma(t)\" and its plural \"luqūm\" meaning \"morsel\" and \"mouthful\" and the alternative Ottoman Turkish name, \"rahat-ul hulküm\", was an Arabic formulation, \"rāḥat al-hulqūm\", meaning \"comfort of the throat\", which remains the name in formal Arabic. In Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia it is known as \"ḥalqūm\", while in Kuwait it is called كبده الفرس \"kabdat alfaras\" and in Egypt it is called \"\" (  ) or \"ʕagameyya\" and in Syria \"rāḥa\". Its name in various Eastern European languages comes from Ottoman Turkish \"lokum\" or \"rahat-ul hulküm\". Its name in Greek, λουκούμι (\"loukoumi\") shares a similar etymology with the modern Turkish and it is marketed as \"Greek Delight\". In Cyprus, where the dessert has protected geographical indication (PGI), it is also marketed as \"Cyprus Delight\". In Armenian it is called lokhum (լոխում). Its name in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Israel is \"rahat lokum\", and derives from a very old confusion of the two Ottoman Turkish names found already in Ottoman Turkish; indeed this mixed name can also be found in Turkey today. Its name in Serbo-Croatian is \"ratluk\", a reduced form of the same name. In Persian, it is called \"rāhat-ol-holqum\" ().\n\nIn English, it was formerly alternatively known as \"Lumps of Delight\".\n\nIn Bulgarian, Turkish Delight is known as lokum (локум) and enjoys some popularity. While it presumably came with the Ottoman Empire, it may have arrived earlier, as the Middle East has been very influential to the country in terms of cuisine. Bulgaria produces its own brands of lokum, which may be plain or spiced with rose petals, white walnuts, or \"endreshe\".\n\nIn Greece, Turkish Delight, known as \"loukoumi\" [λουκούμι] has been a very popular delicacy since the 19th century, famously produced in the city of Patras, Patrina loukoumia, as well as on the island of Syros and the northern Greek cities Thessaloniki, Serres and Komotini but elsewhere as well. Loukoumi is a common traditional treat, routinely served instead of biscuits along with coffee. In addition to the common rosewater and bergamot varieties, Mastic-flavored loukoumi is available and very popular. Another sweet, similar to loukoumi, that is made exclusively in the town of Serres, is Akanés.\n\nThe Romanian word to describe this confection is \"rahat\", an abbreviation of the Arabic \"rahat ul-holkum\". However, in the Romanian language, the word \"rahat\" took a pejorative sense, in this case a euphemism that translates as \"shitty\". According to linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, Turkish words which entered the Romanian language in the seventeenth century and eighteenth century became mostly obsolete and acquired a pejorative or ironic sense. Politically and socially, this weakened the influence of Ottoman society, and parts of the Ottoman Turkish language which had not had time to take root in the Romanian language took a touch of irony and became a mine for humorous literature. Rahat is eaten as is or is added in many Romanian cakes called \"cornulețe\", \"cozonac\" or .\n\nIn the countries of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia and Slovenia), as well as in Albania, Turkish delight is known as \"rahat-lokum\", \"ratluk\" or \"lokum\". It was introduced during Ottoman rule of the Balkans and has remained popular. Today it is commonly consumed with coffee. Rose and walnut are the most common flavorings.\n\nThe Nory Candy company in the Greater Los Angeles area has been producing Turkish Delights or Rahat Locum since 1964. The company produces different fruit and exotic flavors including rose and licorice as well a variety which include nuts such as Almonds, Pistachios, and Walnuts.\n\nIn 1930 two Armenian immigrants, Armen Tertsagian and Mark Balaban, founded Liberty Orchards of Cashmere, Washington, and began manufacturing \"Aplets\" (apple and walnut locoum) and \"Cotlets\" (apricot and walnut locoum). In 1984 they added the medley-flavored \"Fruit Delights\" line in strawberry, raspberry, orange, blueberry, peach, cranberry, and pineapple assortments. Although all of these confections are marketed under American-style brand names, they are referred to on product packaging as \"Rahat Locoum\".\n\nIn Canada, the Big Turk chocolate bar made by Nestlé consists of dark magenta Turkish Delight coated in milk chocolate, and is marketed as both Turkish delight and loukoum.\n\nThe confection is known in Brazil as \"Manjar Turco\", \"Delícia Turca\", \"Bala de Goma Síria\" or \"Bala de Goma Árabe\". As with most Middle Eastern dishes, it came with the Levantine Arab diaspora to Latin America.\n\nFry's Turkish Delight is marketed by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa and can also be found in Canada and New Zealand. It is rosewater-flavoured, and covered on all sides in milk chocolate. UK production controversially moved to Poland in 2010.\n\nDespite its worldwide popularity and production in several countries, at present, the only protected geographical indication (PGI) for such a product is the name Λουκούμι Γεροσκήπου (Loukoumi Geroskipou) for Turkish delight made in Yeroskipou, Cyprus.\n\nTurkish delight was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior.\n\nThere are gourmand perfumes that are based upon Turkish Delight, such as \"Loukhoum\" by Ava Luxe, \"Loukhoum\" by Keiko Mecheri, and \"Rahät Loukoum\" by Serge Lutens.\n\n\n\n"}

However, according to popular Betawi tradition, \"ketoprak\" was actually derived from the acronym of its ingredients; which are ket from \"ketupat\", to from \"tahu\" and \"toge\", and prak from \"digeprak\" (Betawi for: \"mashed\" or \"crushed\"), which describes the method on grounding garlic, chili pepper and peanut granules together to create the peanut sauce.\n\nAlthough today ketoprak is often associated with Jakarta, as the dish is more easily available in this city compared to others. There is a suggestion that the dish might be originated from elsewhere. In Jakarta, majority of ketoprak street vendors hailed from the West Javan city of Cirebon. In Cirebon, an area famous for its ketoprak is in Pasuketan area. Ketoprak might be derived from a popular Javanese-Sundanese dish \"kupat tahu\" (tofu and ketupat), with addition of bihun (rice vermicelli), beansprouts, cucumber and sweet soy sauce.\n\n\"Ketoprak\" consists of sliced fried tofu, steamed rice cake (\"lontong\" or \"ketupat\"), sliced cabbage and cucumber, \"bihun\" (thin rice vermicelli), bean sprouts, served in peanut sauce, topped with \"krupuk\" and fried shallots. The fried tofu can be considered as the centerpiece of the dish, since it is freshly fried directly after customer placed their order, to ensure its freshness and hotness.\n\nThe peanut sauce is made from ground peanut and palm sugar made into a thick paste, mixed with garlic, chili pepper, salt and also \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce).\n\n\"Ketoprak\" is a typical street-food. It was originally popular around the Jakarta area but has spread throughout Java. The seller prepares the ingredients at home and mixes them in front of the customers as they place their orders. It is sold in individual portions from small stalls or carts along the street. Customers may request that the dish be mild, medium or spicy. The price range is about IDR 8.000 to 15.000 according to outlets and ingredients included. Sometimes, hard boiled egg might be added.\n\n\"Ketoprak\" is nearly similar to \"kupat tahu\", \"lotek\" and \"karedok\" from West Java, \"gado-gado\" from Jakarta and also \"pecel\" from Central Java, although the ingredients in the peanut sauces are slightly different. \"Gado-gado\" and \"karedok\" use only brown sugar for sweetening, but in \"ketoprak\" sweet soy sauce is used for additional sweetener, and ground garlic is added. There is also a similar dish from neighboring Singapore called \"Satay bee hoon\".\n\n"}

Originally from Surabaya in Indonesian province of East Java. It uses black nuts/keluak (\"Pangeum edule\", fruits of kepayang tree) as the main seasoning which gives the strong nutty flavor and dark color to the soup.\n\nThe soup is made of ground mixture of garlic, shallot, keluak, ginger, candlenut, turmeric, red chili and salt sauteed with oil until it gets aromatic. The sauteed mixture is then poured into boiled beef stock with diced beef. Lemongrass, galangal, bay leaves, kaffir lime leaves and sugar are then added as seasonings. The special dark or black color of rawon comes from the keluak as the main spice. The soup is usually garnished with green onion and fried shallot, and served with rice, hence the name rawon rice or Nasi Rawon in Indonesian language, together with baby bean sprouts, salted preserved egg, shrimp crackers and sambal chili sauce on the side.\n\nRawon is one of the oldest and the earliest historically identified dish from ancient Java. It was mentioned as \"rarawwan\" in ancient Javanese Taji inscription (901 CE) from the era of Mataram Kingdom.\n\nThere are several variants of rawon, the most popular, however, is rawon from Surabaya. A Surabayan popular variant is called \"rawon setan\" (Devil's rawon), a popular rawon dish from Surabaya. The reason for this nickname is that the \"warung\" (stall) that sells this rawon dish is open from midnight to dawn just like the time when they say devils come out. The rawon setan stall is quite popular in Surabaya.\n\nIn Bali, there is also a meat stew called rawon. This Balinese version, however, is not using any keluak, thus the soup color is not black but rather light brownish grey instead, and they favour pork over beef.\n\n"}

It is the best selling whisky in the UK.\n\nThe Bells distillery was founded in 1798 .\n\nIn 1851, Arthur Bell (1825–1900) began to blend various single malts together to create a more consistent blended whisky. Arthur Bell was the first known whisky manufacturer to appoint a London agent, by at least 1863. Bell's two sons joined the business in partnership in 1895. Arthur Kinmond (1868–1942) was appointed to manage the domestic market and Robert was appointed as head of the brand overseas. By the 1880s the company was focused on blended whisky. Arthur Bell died in 1900. In 1921 the partnership became a private company run by Arthur Kinmond after Robert retired to live as a country gentleman. The end of Prohibition in America created a surge in demand, which led Arthur Bell & Sons to acquire two distilleries in 1933: Blair Athol and Dufftown. In 1936 the Inchgower distillery was also acquired.\n\nThe Bell brothers died in 1942 and the company accountant, William Govan Farquharson, became chairman of the company. He focused on advertising the brand more heavily. Bell's became a public company in 1949. In 1954, Arthur Bell exported to 130 different countries.\n\nBy 1970, Bell's was the highest selling whisky in Scotland. In the early 1970s, Bell's could not afford the advertising budget of the larger whisky distillers. Instead, it focused on the use of mixers with its product. This increased the product's popularity with women, and Bell's revenues rose by 800% between 1970 and 1979. In 1978 Bell's became the UK's highest selling whisky. Much of the credit for this expansion is given to the then managing director Raymond Miquel. By 1980 the company had around 35 percent market share in the UK.\n\nArthur Bell & Sons acquired Gleneagles Hotels in 1984. In 1985 the company was acquired by Guinness for $518 million, and subsequently absorbed into Diageo.\n\nBlair Athol is the main component of the blend. Dufftown and Inchgower still figure, but Glenkinchie and Caol Ila are also components.\n\nThe Pittyvaich distillery was used in the blend between 1974 and 1993.\n\nBell's is bottled at Diageo's Shieldhall, Glasgow plant.\n\nThe product is 40% ABV in the UK, and 43% ABV in South Africa.\n\nThe brand's top markets are the UK, South Africa, the Nordic countries, Spain and Brazil.\n\nA religious man, modesty prevented Arthur Bell from using his name on his whisky.

Originally a royal dish, \"tteok-galbi\" is now a local specialty of Gyeonggi Province in the central-west region and South Jeolla Province in the south-west region of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\"Tteok-galbi\" (), literally translated to \"cake ribs\" as \"tteok\" () means \"rice (or other grain) cake\" and \"galbi\" () means \"rib\". The name comes from the food's similarity in appearance to \"tteok\". The process of kneading and shaping the meat is similar to the process of making a rice cake. The final dish is also soft and tender, much like a rice cake in texture.\n\nThe word \"tteok-galbi\" has a relatively short history that starts in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Before that, the dish was called \"hyo-galbi\" (), meaning \"filial piety ribs\", or \"no-galbi\" (), meaning \"elder ribs\", as it was often a dish for older people whose teeth were too weak to bite off meat from the rib bones. Both the terms \"hyo-galbi\" and \"no-galbi\" were used during the Joseon era (1392–1897).\n\n\"Tteok-galbi\" was a beef dish in Korean royal court cuisine. One story says the dish was born as it was not befitting for kings to gnaw on \"galbi-gui\" (grilled short ribs). Recipes from Gyeonggi Province that char-grill the beef are said to have been imparted from court ladies in the late Joseon era, while the recipes from South Jeolla Province were reportedly passed on by scholarly-officials in exile. The Damyang \"tteok-galbi\", passed on by Song Hui-gyeong (1376–1446) is the most famous among them.\n\nIn modern South Korea, \"tteok-galbi\" is also made with ingredients mixed with or other than beef, such as pork and duck. \"Tteok-galbi\" made with half beef and half pork was first created and sold by Choe Jeo-ja in the 1950s, in Songjeong, Gwangju, South Korea. Now there is a \"\"tteok-galbi\" street\" specializing in the half beef and half pork dish in the Songjeong area. \"Ori-tteok-galbi\" (), made with duck meat, is a popular dish in Gwangju.\n\nMeat is separated from beef short ribs, finely minced, and marinated with various seasonings and aromatics, such as salt, ground black pepper, ginger juice, soy sauce, minced garlic, minced onion, \"cheongju\" (rice wine), sugar, and sesame oil. The marinade is boiled, sifted, and cooled beforehand. The marinated meat is shaped and attached back to the rib bones using a small amount of wheat flour as glue, and char-grilled over oak. Once on the gridiron, the meat patty is brushed with the sauce while it is grilled.\n\nSongjeong \"tteok-galbi\" is made by shaping a mixture of beef and pork into rectangles and grilling. Pork is added to make it fattier since the beef is too dry by itself. The recipe of Choe Jeo-ja calls for hand-kneading the meat for a long time in a seasoning made from nearly 20 ingredients including \"dasima\" (kelp), pear and honey. The sauce is intermittently brushed on the meat while it is slowly grilled over charcoal.\n\nChopsticks are used to cut \"tteok-galbi\".\n\n"}

It is usually prepared from pork belly, or, more rarely, fatback. Salt pork typically resembles uncut slab bacon, but is fattier, being made from the lowest part of the belly, saltier, as the cure is stronger and performed for longer, and never smoked. \n\nAlong with hardtack, salt pork was a standard ration for many militaries and navies throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, seeing usage in the American Civil War, War of 1812, and the Napoleonic Wars, among others. Salt pork now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, as with greens in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use.\nSalt pork that contains a significant amount of meat, resembling standard side bacon, is known as \"streak o' lean\". It is traditionally popular in the Southeastern United States. As a stand-alone food product, it is typically boiled to remove much of the salt content and partially cook the product, then fried until it starts to develop a crisp exterior.

Owner Stephen Bruce states that a notice 48 hours in advance is needed when requesting the Sundae, since the ingredients must be flown in from different parts of the world.\n\nGolden Opulence Sundae is made using three scoops of rich Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream infused with Madagascar vanilla and covered in 23k edible gold leaf. The chocolate syrup used is from melted Amedei Porcelana, one of the world's most expensive chocolates; and covered with chunks of rare Chuao chocolate, which is from cocoa beans harvested by the Caribbean Sea on Venezuela’s coast. The sundae is then adorned with \"exotic candied fruits from Paris, gold covered almonds/dragets, chocolate truffles and marzipan cherries.\" Added to the dessert is a tiny glass bowl of Grand Passion Caviar, an exclusive dessert caviar, made of salt-free American Golden caviar, known for its sparkling golden color. It’s sweetened and infused with fresh passion fruit, orange and Armagnac. Edible gold leaf is made from pure gold that is compressed or rolled into very thin sheets that are only a few micrometers thick and contain no other metals or impurities. It is finally topped off with a gilded sugar flower and sprinkled with small flakes of more edible gold. The sundae comes in a $350 Baccarat Harcourt crystal goblet which the buyer gets to keep.\n\nThe sundae was used as a gag on the US NBC television series \"30 Rock\". It was also previously featured on Forbes' list of the world's most expensive desserts until being dropped in 2008 along with Serendipity 3's 25,000 Frozen Haute Chocolate.\n"}
