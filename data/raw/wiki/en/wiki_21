Depending on the ingredients, \"jeotgal\" can range from flabby, solid pieces to clear, broth-like liquid. Solid \"jeotgal\" are usually eaten as \"banchan\" (side dishes). Liquid \"jeotgal\", called aekjeot () or fish sauce, is popularly used in kimchi seasoning, as well as in various soups and stews (\"guk\", \"jijimi\", \"jjigae\"). As a condiment, jeotgal with smaller bits of solid ingredients such as \"saeu-jeot\" (shrimp \"jeotgal\") is commonly served as a dipping sauce with pork dishes (\"bossam\", \"jokbal\", \"samgyeopsal\"), \"sundae\" (Korean sausage), \"hoe\" (raw fish), and a number of soups and stews.\n\nFermented foods were widely available in Three Kingdoms of Korea, as \"Sānguózhì\", a Jin Chinese historical text published in 289, mentions that the Goguryeo Koreans are skilled in making fermented foods such as wine, soybean paste and salted and fermented fish in the section titled \"Dongyi\" in the \"Book of Wei\". The first Korean record of \"jeotgal\" appeared in \"Samguk Sagi\", with a reference that King Sinmun offered rice, wine, jerky, and \"jeotgal\" as wedding presents in 683. In 1124, a Song Chinese envoy wrote that \"jeotgal\" was enjoyed by high and low alike in Goryeo. Twenty-four types of \"jeotgal\" appear in \"Miam ilgi\", a 16th century diary written by a Joseon literatus, and over 180 types of \"jeotgal\" can be found in the coeval books \"Gosa chwaryo\" and \"Swaemirok\", and in 17‒18th century books \"Eumsik dimibang\", \"Sallim gyeongje\", and \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\".\n\nThe types of \"jeotgal\" vary depending on main ingredients, regions, and family and personal preferences. In past times, due to the limited availability of transportation, regions near seas had more types of \"jeot\" compared to the inland areas.\n\n"}

The sugar blends into a creamy texture that comes from the basic mixture, khoya (optional), a traditional Pakistani and Indian dairy confection made from thickened whole milk. The mix is generally heated until the milk solidifies and is then placed in molds of different shapes—diamond, square or sometimes round.\n\nBesan ki barfi is a very common sweet in India, especially during winter. It is usually garnished with sliced or chopped almonds or pistachios. It resembles an orange-colored cheese, it is sometimes called \"Indian cheesecake\", though it contains no cheese. Newer \"fusion cuisine\" variations include apricot, mango and coconut flavorings.\n\nThe presence of Besan provides very smooth texture, thus makes Khoya an optional ingredient. Since Khoya is optional it makes the sweet safe to be stored for more than a week. Indian Traditional Sweets are now available online also, though previously used to be made at home only.\n"}

It is made of a suet pastry, filled with butter and sugar, and is boiled or steamed for several hours. Modern versions of the recipe often include a whole lemon enclosed in the pastry. The dish is first recorded in Hannah Woolley's 1672 book, \"The Queen-Like Closet\".\n\nThis rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years, perhaps due to diet consciousness, although the British chef Heston Blumenthal has served it as part of his campaign to revive historic British foods.\n\nA variant including currants is known from both Sussex and Kent. In Sussex this was formerly called \"Blackeyed Susan\". The Kentish version is known as \"Kentish well pudding\", a recipe included in Eliza Acton's pioneering 19th century cookery book \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\". \"Well pudding\" was also said to have been the more familiar name for the dish in East Sussex. \n\nWhile cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, caramelized sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a “pond”. After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon, if included, almost candies like a marmalade in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.\n\nLike other suet puddings, traditional recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.\n\nThe best lemons to use in this pudding are thin-skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.\n\nThe first recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding is (as \"a Sussex pudding\") in Hannah Woolley's \"The Queen-Like Closet\" (1672). The recipe features an egg-enriched pastry wrapped around a \"great piece of Butter\". Woolley suggests adding sugar and rosewater only after cooking and cutting open the pudding, and garnishes the cooked pudding with barberries. \n\nThe 18th century Sussex shopkeeper and diarist Thomas Turner described the dish as \"butter pond pudding\", complaining about the amount of butter it contained. He also mentioned eating pond pudding with currants. It appears that at this stage of its history the pudding was not prepared with a lemon: as with the recipe given by Woolley, older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all. A recipe found by Florence White, and included in her 1932 book \"Good Things in England\", was based on one supplied to her by H J Glover and said to have been made \"boiled in a cloth (the correct way)\nin 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of Westham\":\n\nWriting in 1939, the journalist and biographer Reginald Pound described \"my native Sussex pond pudding\" as \"made of crust, brown sugar and butter\", with lemons not mentioned. The first recorded version using a whole lemon was published in Jane Grigson's \"English Food\" (1974). Grigson said that the bitterness of the lemon improved the dish, claiming \"versions of this pudding without the lemon are not worth bothering about\". \n\nIn her \"A History of English Food\", Clarissa Dickson Wright describes the pudding as requiring \"considerable flair to make\", as the cook needs to scratch the lemon \"so that its flavours burst out while it is being cooked\". \n\n\n\n"}

The rice rolled inside banana leaf and boiled, then cut into small cakes as staple food replacement of steamed rice. The texture is similar to those of \"ketupat\", with the difference that \"ketupat\" container was made from weaved \"janur\" (young coconut leaf) fronds, while \"lontong\" uses banana leaf instead.\n\nIt is commonly called \"nasi himpit\" (lit. \"pressed rice\") in Malaysia, despite actually having different method to create it.\n\n\"Arem-arem\" is the smaller size of \"lontong\" filled with vegetables (carrot, common bean and potato) sometimes also filled with meat, are eaten as snack.\n\nThe dish is usually served cold or at room temperature with peanut sauce-based dishes such as \"gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak\", other traditional salads, and satay. It can be eaten as an accompaniment to coconut milk-based soups, such as \"lontong sayur\", \"soto, gulai\" and curries. It is also used as an alternative to vermicelli noodles.\n\n\"Lontong\" is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a rolled-up banana leaf. The leaf is secured with \"lidi semat\", wooden needle made from the central rib of coconut leaf, and cooked in boiling water for about 90 minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into bite-sized pieces. Outer parts of \"lontong\" usually have greenish color because of the chlorophyll left by banana leaf rub off on rice cake surface.\n\nAlternative ways of cooking \"lontong\" include placing uncooked rice into a muslin bag then letting the water seep in and cause the rice to form a solid mass. Another popular and easier method is by using commercially available plastic pouches; rice-filled and punctured with needle to create small holes to allow the water to seep into the package, which are then boiled until the rice becomes cooked and have fully filled up the pouch. This method was meant to imitate the banana leaf's liquid permeability. Nevertheless, the use of organic banana leaf is highly recommended for better health and ecological reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, Malaysian \"nasi himpit\" (lit. \"pressed rice\") is traditionally created differently. The method is more a mechanical pressure than applying permeable boiling technique; freshly cooked rice is compressed for a few hours between two heavy stone slabs or two trays with a heavy weight on top to produce \"nasi himpit\". However, \"nasi himpit\" is now usually speedily produced in water permeable plastic sachets filled with rice and boiled in water.\n\nJust like rice, the taste of \"lontong\" is bland and neutral, it depends on other ingredients to give taste through spices and sauces. Commonly, \"lontong\" serves as the compact alternative of steamed rice. It can be served with almost any traditional dish recipes as staple food, but mostly have peanut sauce or coconut milk-based soup.\n\nIn Indonesia, especially among Betawi people, lontong usually served as \"lontong sayur\", pieces of lontong served in coconut milk soup with shredded chayote, tempeh, tofu, hard-boiled egg, \"sambal\" and \"kerupuk\". \"Lontong sayur\" is related and quite similar to \"Ketupat sayur\" and is a favourite breakfast menu next to \"bubur ayam\" and \"nasi uduk\".\n\nThe more elaborate recipe of \"lontong\" is \"Lontong Cap Go Meh\", a peranakan Chinese Indonesian adaptation on traditional Indonesian dishes, lontong served with rich \"opor ayam\", \"sayur lodeh\", \"sambal goreng ati\" (beef liver in sambal), acar, \"telur pindang\" (hard boiled tea egg), \"abon\" (beef floss), and \"koya\" powder (mixture of soy and dried shrimp powder). \"Lontong Cap Go Meh\" usually consumed by Chinese Indonesian community during \"Cap go meh\" celebration.\n\nLontong dekem is originated from Pemalang Regency, Central Java. The process involves soaking the lontong in soup until it is submerged hence the name \"dekem\" meaning \"immersion\" in Pemalang Javanese dialect.\n\n\"Lontong kari\" is lontong serve in soupy chicken curry and vegetables.\n\n\"Lontong kikil\" is lontong serve in spicy cow's trotters soup and vegetables.\n\nAnother lontong recipes are \"lontong kupang\" and \"lontong balap\" from Surabaya and Sidoarjo area in East Java. \"Lontong kupang\" is made of \"lontong\" served with small white clams.\n\nAlso from Surabaya, \"lontong balap\" is made from \"lontong\", \"taoge\" (bean sprouts), fried tofu, \"lentho\" (fried mashed beans), fried shallots, \"sambal petis\" and sweet soy sauce. East Javanese \"lontong\" and \"tofu\" recipes are known of their distinctive flavour, acquired from generous amount of \"petis\" (a type of shrimp paste).\n\nIn West Sumatra, a Minang dish from Padang Pariaman is called \"lontong gulai pakis\", lontong served with young fern leaves \"gulai\". Usually served with hard boiled eggs and \"kerupuk jangek\" or \"krupuk kulit\" (cow skin crackers).\n\n\"Arem-arem\" is the smaller size \"lontong\" filled with diced vegetables such as carrot, common bean and potato seasoned with salt and red chili, or tofu, \"oncom\" and tempeh. sometimes also filled with minced meat or \"abon\" (beef floss), are eaten as snack. The rice is flavored with coconut milk. This kind of snack is called \"arem-arem\" in Javanese, but commonly called simply as \"lontong\" or \"lontong isi\" in other parts of Indonesia. It is a common snack in Java, and quite similar to \"lemper\", but use common rice instead of sticky rice \"lemper\". It is usually uses thin young banana leaf as wrapper, a thin light yellow-green colored banana leaf. \"Lontong\" on the other hand, usually uses thicker mature banana leaf. The texture of \"arem-arem\" snack is softer compared to those of common \"lontong\", due to thinner banana leaf, addition of coconut milk and prolonged boiling and steaming period.\n\nIt is commonly called \"nasi himpit\" (lit. \"pressed rice\") in Malaysia, and unlike lontong, \"nasi himpit\" is created by pressing rice overnight. The \"lontong\" rice cake is cut into smaller pieces, these rice cakes pieces are known as \"nasi himpit\" (compressed rice). The term \"lontong\" in Malaysia and Singapore usually refers a dish which consists of rice cakes in a coconut based soup such as \"sayur lodeh\" containing shrimp and vegetables like chopped cabbage, turnip and carrots. Additional condiments are added either during cooking or in individual servings. These include things such as fried tempeh, fried tofu, boiled eggs, dried cuttlefish sambal, fried spicy shredded coconut (\"serunding kelapa\"), fried chicken etc.\n\n\"Nasi himpit\" is also an accompaniment to satay and eaten with peanut sauce. In the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia, \"nasi himpit\" is eaten with peanut sauce (\"kuah kacang\") for breakfast. \"Nasi himpit\" is also one of the ingredients in the Malaysian version of chicken \"soto\".\n\n"}

Haleem is a stew composed of meat, lentils and pounded wheat made into a thick paste. It is originally an Arabic dish and was introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the rule of the Nizams (the former rulers of Hyderabad State). Local traditional spices helped a unique Hyderabadi haleem evolve, which became popular among the native Hyderabadis by the 19th century.\n\nThe preparation of haleem has been compared to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010 it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to receive this status.\n\nHaleem originated as an Arabic dish with meat and pounded wheat as the chief ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab diaspora during the rule of the sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.\n\nHyderabadi Haleem officially introduced in Madina Hotel by Aga Hussain Zabeth, the Iranian founder of the hotel in 1956.\n\nThe hotel which opened in 1947 in the Waqf property named Madina Building at Pathargatti which the rent from it was used to serve Haj pilgrims, Madina hotel is one of the oldest restaurant in the Hyderabad. After renovation of Madina hotel it was inaugurated by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1956.\n\nTraditionally, Hyderabadi haleem is cooked on a low flame of firewood for up to 12 hours in a \"bhatti\" (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a \"Ghotni\" (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.\n\nThe ingredients include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee—(milk fat rendered from butter, also called clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; red chili pepper spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds (\"shah zeera\"), cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, allspice (\"kabab cheeni\"); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish.\n\nDifferent variants have been introduced catering to regional taste and requirements. A \"meethi\" (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, even though it is lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.\n\nHyderabadi haleem is a high calorie dish which gives instant energy as it contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients. It also contains dry fruits rich in anti-oxidants. The meat and dry fruits make it a high protein food. A new low-cholesterol variety by using emu meat, rich in minerals, phosphorus and vitamins, was introduced in 2013. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), a local civic body that monitors health and safety regulations in the city, has set up hygiene and quality standards to be followed by the eateries selling it.\n\nHyderabadi haleem is regarded as an international delicacy. In Hyderabad, the dish is often consumed at celebratory events such as weddings. It is consumed especially during Iftaar, the evening meal following the day-long fast, observed by Muslims during the month of Ramadan.\n\nIn Hyderabad and neighbouring areas, the month of Ramadan is synonymous with Hyderabadi haleem. During the 2014 Ramadan season, 5 billion worth of Hyderabadi haleem was sold in the city, and an additional 25,000 people were employed in the preparation and sale of haleem. The connoisseur chefs are paid salaries of up to a month plus benefits, As of 2011, during Ramadan there were 6,000 eateries throughout the city that sold haleem (70% of which are temporary until Ramadan ends), and 28% of Hyderabadi haleem produced in the city was exported to 50 countries throughout the world.\n\nSanjeev Kapoor, an entrepreneur of Indian cuisine, mentions in his book \"Royal Hyderabadi Cooking\" that the preparation of haleem in Hyderabad has become an art form, much like the Hyderabadi biryani. In 2010 Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification, This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem unless it meets the necessary standards laid down for it.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as Hackepeter (Northern Germany, Eastern Germany and Berlin). It consists of minced pork meat, normally sold or served seasoned with salt and black pepper, regionally also with garlic or caraway, and eaten raw. It is also permitted to add chopped onion, in which case it is known as \"Zwiebelmett\" (onion Mett). Legally, German Mett is not allowed to contain more than 35% fat.

They may be commercially packaged or frozen at home. A wide range of frozen vegetables are sold in supermarkets.\n\nExamples of frozen vegetables which can be found in supermarkets include spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, yam (in Asia) either packaged as a single ingredient or as mixtures. There are occasions when frozen vegetables are mixed with other food types, such as pasta or cheese.\n\nSome popular brands include Birds Eye, Sunbulah and Green Giant, as well as supermarkets' 'store brand' items.\n\nFrozen vegetables have some advantages over fresh ones, in that they are available when the fresh counterpart is out-of-season, they have a very long shelf life when kept in a freezer and that they often have been processed a step or more closer to eating. In many cases, they may be more economical to purchase than their fresh counterparts.\n\nThe history of frozen fruits can date back to the Liao Dynasty of China, with the \"frozen\" pear being a classic delicacy eaten by the Khitan tribes in the Northeastern region of China.\n\nIn general, boiling vegetables can cause them to lose vitamins. Thus, the process of blanching does have deleterious effects on some nutrients. In particular, vitamin C and folic acid are susceptible to loss during the commercial process, and canned or frozen broccoli for instance loses the entirety of its most valuable nutrient. In addition, studies have shown that thawing frozen vegetables before cooking can accelerate the loss of vitamin C.\n\nOver the years, there has been controversy as to whether frozen vegetables are better or worse than fresh ones. Generally, reports show that frozen vegetables are as nutritionally beneficial when compared to fresh ones.\n\nA 1997 study performed by the University of Illinois, 2007 study performed by University of California - Davis and a 2003 Austrian study support that canned or frozen produce has no substantial nutritional difference not attributable to the presence of added salt, syrup or other flavouring, and in fact suggest that canned or frozen produce is nutritionally superior because of the very rapid deterioration of nutrients in fresh produce. \n\nAn advantage that frozen vegetables have over canned is that many brands contain little or no added salt because the freezing process by itself is able to stop bacterial growth. However, many canned vegetable brands with little or no sodium have become available and many frozen brands do have salt added for more flavour.\n\nHowever, there may be some risk in eating poorly cooked frozen vegetables. For example, a 2007 Australian study found that frozen vegetables may contain a bacterium called Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) which is resistant to extreme cold and hot temperatures.\n\n\n"}

A dumpling—in this context—is a biscuit dough, which is a mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid (water, milk, buttermilk, or chicken stock). The dumplings are either rolled out flat, dropped or formed into a ball.\n\nIt is a popular comfort food dish, commonly found in the Southern and Midwestern United States, that is also attributed to being a French Canadian meal that originated during the Great Depression. Some sources say that chicken and dumplings originated in the Southern United States during antebellum era and was considered a mainstay during harsh economic times. One of the earliest versions of the recipe was cornmeal dumplings cooked with turnip greens. Chicken and dumplings as a dish is prepared with a combination of simmered chicken meat, broth produced by simmering the chicken, multiple dumplings, and salt and pepper for seasoning. Sometimes finely chopped vegetables, such as carrots and celery, are added to the broth, and herbs such as dill, parsley, thyme, or chives are added to the dumpling dough. \n\nVarious commercial preparations of chicken and dumplings are available, including canned and frozen versions of the prepared dish. Frozen raw dumplings, typically very flat strips about 1x4 inches, can be cooked in any broth. The consistency of the prepared dish, whether homemade or purchased, varies from a thin soup to a very thick casserole-like consistency, easily eaten with a fork. Thicker preparations are made by gently simmering the dumplings longer and/or adding flour or another thickening agent directly to the broth. Flour tortillas or canned biscuits, rolled thin on a floured surface, cut into strips, are a quick and easy substitute for homemade dough. Butter may be added to the recipe for added richness.\nSince chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so as to not further cook the chicken.\n\nAlthough the dumpling has been around for many generations, each culture has its own way of individualizing the basic dumpling recipe. There are other international versions of chicken and dumplings. For instance, the Chinese culture has the wonton, which is similar to the chicken and dumplings dish as we know it today. Additionally, the Iranian-Jewish dish, called gondi, includes matzah ball dumplings, which are also common in Central European food.\n\nSince the creation of the dumpling, various meats aside from chicken have accompanied it, such as beef, lamb and pork.\n\nA variant known as \"chicken and pastry\" or simply \"chicken pastry\" features wide, flat noodles rolled from biscuit dough. Where such a distinction is made, it is sometimes considered a different dish from \"chicken and dumplings\", which is known for small balls of dough rather than flat strips. In the Appalachian region of the United States, this preparation is called chicken and slicks. The Pennsylvania Dutch version is called \"bott boi\". Chicken and dumpling soup is another variation, and is very popular in the Midwest.\n\n"}

That is, if an ensemble of copies of the DFA are each started in different states, and all of the copies process the synchronizing word at the same speed, they will all end up reaching the same state as each other, at the same time as each other. Not every DFA has a synchronizing word; for instance, a DFA with two states, one for words of even length and one for words of odd length, can never be synchronized.\n\nGiven a DFA, the problem of determining if it has a synchronizing word can be solved in polynomial time using a theorem due to Ján Černý. A simple approach considers the power set of states of the DFA, and builds a directed graph where nodes belong to the power set, and a directed edge describes the action of the transition function. A path from the node of all states to a singleton state shows the existence of a synchronizing word. This algorithm is exponential in the number of states. A polynomial algorithm results however, due to a theorem of Černý which exploits the substructure of the problem, and shows that a synchronizing word exists if and only if every pair of states has a synchronizing word.\n\nThe problem of estimating the length of synchronizing words has a long history and was posed independently by several authors, but it is commonly known as the Černý conjecture. In 1964 Ján Černý conjectured that (\"n\" − 1) is the upper bound for the length of the shortest synchronizing word for any \"n\"-state complete DFA (a DFA with complete state transition graph). If this is true, it would be tight: in his 1964 paper, Černý exhibited a class of automata (indexed by the number \"n\" of states) for which the shortest reset words have this length. The best upper bound known is (\"n\"- n)/6, far from the lower bound. \nFor \"n\"-state DFAs over a \"k\"-letter input alphabet, an algorithm by David Eppstein finds a synchronizing word of length at most 11\"n\"/48 + O(\"n\"), and runs in time complexity O(\"n\"+\"kn\"). This algorithm does not always find the shortest possible synchronizing word for a given automaton; as Eppstein also shows, the problem of finding the shortest synchronizing word is NP-complete. However, for a special class of automata in which all state transitions preserve the cyclic order of the states, he describes a different algorithm with time O(\"kn\") that always finds the shortest synchronizing word, proves that these automata always have a synchronizing word of length at most (\"n\" − 1) (the bound given in Černý's conjecture), and exhibits examples of automata with this special form whose shortest synchronizing word has length exactly (\"n\" − 1).\n\nThe road coloring problem is the problem of labeling the edges of a regular directed graph with the symbols of a \"k\"-letter input alphabet (where \"k\" is the outdegree of each vertex) in order to form a synchronizable DFA. It was conjectured in 1970 by Benjamin Weiss and Roy Adler that any strongly connected and aperiodic regular digraph can be labeled in this way; their conjecture was proven in 2007 by Avraham Trahtman.\n\nA transformation semigroup is synchronizing if it contains an element of rank 1. A DFA corresponds to a transformation semigroup with a distinguished generator set.\n\n"}

Conceptualised and launched in Melbourne, Australia in 1993 by McDonald's Licensee Ann Brown, and introduced to the public with help from McDonald's CEO Charlie Bell and then-Chairman and future CEO James Skinner, the chain reflects a consumer trend towards espresso coffees.\n\nReports indicated that McCafé outlets generated 15% more revenue than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003, were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe McCafé concept was designed to help create atmosphere and foot-traffic at the entrance to the McDonalds stores at Swanston Street, Melbourne (a very large store with the front counter a considerable distance from the shop's entrance). The idea was developed between Charlie Bell and the local Regional Corporate team (David Bayes, Mike Tregurtha and Jim Vasiliadis). The first McCafe opened as a Corporate store in Melbourne, and not by a licensee as indicated above (Ann Brown was Brisbane based). The first one in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, in May 2001 when there were about 300 worldwide. In 2004 McCafé opened in Costa Rica and in France, and the next year, the concept was launched in Italy. In 2007, the chain expanded to Japan as part of McDonald's efforts to boost sales with healthier soup and sandwich offerings and reach out to new customers who favoured traditional coffee shops. Despite being a relatively small part of McDonald's overall strategy, there are currently 1,300 worldwide.\n\nIn June 2006 the very first McCafé in Bulgaria opened at the Mall of Sofia.\n\nMcCafé arrived In Paraguay in 2007.\n\nIn August 2008, McDonald's expanded their McCafé concept to South Africa, where the McDonald's franchise is already a household name and one of the largest fast-food chains in the country.\nAt the end of 2009 McCafé drinks were available at McDonald's restaurants in the United States.\nMcCafé opened in El Salvador on July 6, 2010, located in McDonald's restaurants in the Zona Rosa and Próceres Boulevard with the goal of providing the aroma, flavor and texture of 100% Salvadorian gourmet coffee.\n\nMcCafé opened in Madrid, Spain on June 28, 2008, located in McDonald's Montera restaurants.\n\nIn 2011 McDonald's started expansion of McCafé in Ukraine. There are 6 McCafés in Kiev, 1 in Lviv, 1 in Odesa, 1 in Dnipropetrovsk and 1 in Kharkiv as of January, 2014.\n\nIn July 2010 the McCafé added real fruit smoothies to their drink list. In November 2010 they added mocha and hot chocolate to their drink list. In July 2011 they added Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and the Mango Pineapple Smoothie to the U.S. menu.\n\nOn November 7, 2011, McDonald's Canada launched McCafé across the nation after being available only in select stores prior to this announcement. With the introduction of McCafé in Canada, participating McDonald's stores have added mocha, cappuccino, espresso, americano, latte, iced latte, iced mocha and hot chocolate to their menus. With McCafé, McDonald's is now in direct competition with Coffee Time, Country Style, Second Cup, Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and Timothy's in the Canadian coffee market.\n\nOn June 16, 2012, McDonald's launched the first McCafé Malaysia in Kota Damansara, with a few others subsequently opening in the Bandar Utama, Subang Jaya, Titiwangsa, and Taman Connaught outlets - all currently located in Klang Valley as well as in Greenlane, Birch House, IJM Promenade and Penang International Airport - all in Penang.\n\nIn Turkey, McCafé operates under the name \"McD Café\". The first coffee shop opened in July 2012 at Sabiha Gökçen Airport. As of April 2016, there are 8 Mcd Cafés on the Asian side of Istanbul, 6 on the European side, 3 in Antalya, 2 each in Adana and Kocaeli, and one each in Afyonkarahisar, Aksaray, Ankara and Kırşehir.\n\nIn December 2012, McDonald's announced that it would be bringing the McCafé brand and line of products to all of the McDonald's restaurants in the United Kingdom. This would include the addition of iced frappés, iced fruit smoothies and a rebranding of the standard McDonald's coffee to \"McCafé.\"\n\nOn October 14, 2013, McDonald's launched the first McCafé India in the South Mumbai area in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nMcDonald's introduced a coffee line called \"McCafé\" nationwide in the United States. \nIn August 2014, the company announced it was going to start to selling its coffee for home brewing in supermarkets across the United States. Manufactured and distributed in partnership with Kraft Foods, the coffee is currently available in prepackaged bags and K-Cups.\n\nIn December 2015, McDonald's Canada opened its first standalone McCafe store in Toronto Union Station's newly built York concourse area.\n\nOn March 20, 2018, the first McCafé in Minsk, Belarus was opened. Another McCafé opened its doors in Minsk on June 24, 2018, and one more was planned to open by the end of 2018.\n\nIn 2019 McCafé opened in different cities of Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

Mount Tam, a triple cream cheese similar to Explorateur, and Red Hawk, also a triple cream, with a washed rind, are the more well-known of their aged cheeses, but the company also makes four seasonal soft cheeses: \"Pierce Point\", \"Saint Pat\", \"Chimney Rock,\" and \"Devil's Gulch.\" Only two of their aged cheeses are in a slightly different format: \"Inverness\" looks like an aged goat cheese but is actually made with cow's milk, and is only available at Cowgirl's stores due to a short shelf life; \"Wagon Wheel\", which is a semi-firm cheese designed to melt, is made in 25-pound wheels.

It has taken on various meanings in various contexts since the 20th century.\n\nThe term was introduced into Vernacular Chinese by Sun Yat-sen as a way of describing his followers. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, \"tongzhi\" was used to mean \"comrade\" in the Communist sense: it was used to address almost everyone, male and female, young and old. In recent years, however, this meaning of the term has fallen out of common usage, except within Chinese Communist Party discourse and among people of older generations.\n\nIn contemporary Taiwan and Hong Kong, the term mainly referred to the LGBT people instead of the traditional political usage.\n\nIt remains in use in a formal context among political parties in both mainland China and Taiwan. In the Communist Party of China, the labelling of a person as a \"comrade\" is especially significant for a person who has been denounced or demoted, because it indicates that the party has not completely rejected the person as \"one of its own\". In Taiwan, it also remains in formal usage in party politics. For example, Frank Hsieh said, after losing the Republic of China presidential election, 2008: \"很多同志希望我能夠留到五月二十五日\" (\"Many comrades hoped that I could stay to May 25\").\n\nIn October 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive urging all 90 million party members to keep calling each other \"comrades\" instead of less egalitarian terms.\n\nThe word \"comrade\" is in the regulations of the Chinese Armed Forces as one of three appropriate ways to formally address another member of the military (\"comrade\" plus rank or position, as in \"Comrade Colonel\", or simply \"comrade(s)\" when lacking information about the person's rank, or talking to several servicepeople.)\n\nSince the 1990s, the term is, however, increasingly being used to refer to sexual minorities mainly in Taiwan and Hong Kong and increasingly in Mainland China, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. This way of using the term was first adopted by Michael Lam (), a columnist writing in Hong Kong magazine \"City Magazine\" (), and popularised by the inaugural Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1989, with the aim of presenting same-sex relationships are positive and suggesting solidarity between LGBT people, while also providing an indigenous term to capture the Chinese experience of same-sex love.\n\nIt is preferred by LGBT communities over the term \"tóngxìnglìan\" (), the formal word for homosexuality, which is seen as being too clinical and having pathological connotations. The use of \"tongzhi\" over \"tóngxìnglìan\" roughly parallels the replacement of \"homosexual\" with \"gay\" in the Western discourse.\n\nAlthough it initially referred to gay (male tongzhi, 男同志) and lesbian (female tongzhi, 女同志) people, in recent years, the term gradually covers a wider range of meaning including \"LGBTQIA\". For example, Taiwan LGBT Pride parade (), Asia's biggest LGBT pride parade, can be literally translated as \"Taiwan Tongzhi Parade.\" According to Chou Wah-Shan, Tóngzhì is a very fluid term which can refer to all people who are opposed to or fall outside of heteronormativity. He views Tóngzhì as a means of signifying \"politics beyond the homo-hetero duality\" and \"integrating the sexual into the social\".\n\n\n\n"}

With \"tteok\" (rice cakes), \"hangwa\" forms the sweet food category in Korean cuisine. Various \"hangwa\" have been used in traditional ceremonies such as \"jerye\" (ancestral rite) and \"hollye\" (wedding). In modern South Korea, \"hangwa\" is also available at coffee shops and tea houses.\n\nCommon ingredients of \"hangwa\" include grain flour, fruits and roots, sweet ingredients such as honey and \"yeot\", and spices such as cinnamon and ginger.\n\n\"Hangwa\" () as meaning \"Korean confectionery\" is a name given to traditional confections in contrast to \"yanggwa\" (), meaning \"Western confectionery\". In the past \"hangwa\" was called \"jogwa\" () as meaning \"crafted fruit\" or \"gwajeongnyu\" () as meaning \"fruit food category\".\n\nThe history of \"hangwa\" goes back to the era of the three kingdoms (57 BCE ‒ 668 CE), when various types of confections were consumed by royals, according to the \"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\".\n\nPassing the two Buddhist dynasties, Unified Silla in the era of two kingdoms (698–926) and Goryeo (936‒1392), the cultivation of crops and consumption of confections increased drastically as the Buddhist diets forbade meat. Confections were offered in Goryeo's national feasts, rites, ceremonies, and banquets, including the two Buddhist festivals, the Lotus Lantern Festival and the Festival of the Eight Vows. Prevailing tea ceremonies also required more types of confections.\n\nConcerns regarding the increasingly excessive use of confections that have large amounts of oil, grain, and honey have consequently lead to several regulations throughout the course of its history. In 1117, King Sukjong issued a restriction on the extravagant usage of deep-fried grain confections. In 1192, it was commanded to replace deep-fried grain confections with fruits. In 1353, a total ban was placed on deep-fried grain confections.\n\nRestrictions continued in the Joseon (1392‒1897), according to \"Comprehensive Collection of the National Codes\" that recorded that the use of deep-fried grain confections was restricted solely for rites, weddings, and toasts to longevity. Commoners caught eating them on occasions other than that were subjected to monetary fines or corporal punishment.\n\n\"Hangwa\" can be classified into eight main categories, namely \"dasik\" (tea food), \"gwapyeon\" (fruit jelly), \"jeonggwa\" (fruit jerky), \"suksil-gwa\", \"yeot-gangjeong\", \"yugwa\", \"yumil-gwa\", and candies.\nOther \"hangwa\" varieties include:\n\n"}

The name \"lefse\" covers many different kinds of thin or thick, soft or hard pastry. In the Norwegian language \"krote\" means \"a scroll\" and \"kake\" is a cake or pastry. A common misunderstanding is that all kind of \"lefse\" contains potatoes.\n\nThe making of \"krotekaker\" is more than a recipe.

The preparation and assembly can take much of the day and provides plenty of time to share stories and catch up on neighborhood information while producing a bounty of staple foodstuff.\n\nThe first step in the process is to mix a simple whole-wheat yeast dough and let it rise.

This is formed by turning the edges of the dough-ball down and tucking them into the middle of the bottom of the ball. If the ball feels sticky, the biskit maker adds a dusting of flour. A ball is formed which has been pulled smooth on top and has a dimple on the bottom. The ball is then placed on the floured surface – dimple down. The biscuit maker should have one or two of these finished balls ready so that they have a minute or two to rest before they are rolled.\nThe roller is responsible for shaping the round. A biscuit is rolled with a smooth round rolling pin until it is three or four inches (102 mm) in diameter and about 1/2 inch (125 mm) thick. It is then flipped over and rolled again until it is larger and thinner and shaped like a disk. At no time should the round stick to the pin or the table. If it appears to be getting sticky it should be flipped onto a new dusting of flour. The round is flipped and rolled and dusted until it is about 1/8 inch thick and twelve inches (305 mm) in diameter. If the round ends up sticking it needs to be scraped off the table or pin and placed back with the mass of dough.\n\nNext the round is rolled with a special steel rolling pin. The pin has deep grooves about 1/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch apart. It is also cut laterally at 1/8 inch intervals. The pin presses creases into the round but because of the lateral grooves it does not cut the round into ribbons of dough. This pin is firmly rolled across the round and then again at right angles to the original direction leaving a cross-hatch pattern which seals the top and bottom surfaces of the round to each other. The round may also be slightly sealed to the tabletop. A lefse stick is a thin, flat, wooden stick with straight sides about long and 1½ inches wide which has been sanded smooth. This stick is used to slide under the \"krotekake\" to release it from the floured surface. It is also used to scrape the table or pin clean of dough.\n\nThe same person who rolls the biscuit thin usually cuts the round with the Hardanger pin. Since the making of \"krotekake\" is a social event as well as a cooking technique, the role of using this special pin is sometimes delegated to a guest or child who is just learning the tradition.\n\nThe cook takes the scored round from the table and places it on a hot (~400 °F) flat grill. he cook is responsible for grill temperature which be determined by the amount of time a drop of water takes to boil off. The grill is not oiled but relies on an excess of flour to prevent any sticking. The burnt flour must be periodically brushed off. In a traditional oven, the round must be tossed onto the grill since there is no room to place it carefully.\n\nEach of these steps takes approximately the same amount of time. This means the team can get into a rhythm where their work and conversation are in sync. A fourth member if available usually stacks the drying product, and divides it into shares for the participants. Team members can frequently exchange roles depending on their preferences.\n\nIn Hardanger Norway many dwellings have a special arched oven in a separate building in which the \"Krotekaker\" is cooked. The separate building is a guard against a house fire. The arched oven reflects the heat of the fire and so the Krotekaker cooks on both sides at the same time. There is no need to flip it.\n"}

{"id": "13761926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13761926", "title": "Sustainable seafood", "text": "Sustainable seafood\n\nSustainable seafood is seafood that is either caught or farmed in ways that consider the long-term vitality of harvested species and the well-being of the oceans, as well as the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities. It was first promoted through the sustainable seafood movement which began in the 1990s. This operation highlights overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods. Through a number of initiatives, the movement has increased awareness and raised concerns over the way our seafood is obtained.\n\nMarine environments are currently under immense pressure. Their problems primarily arise through anthropogenic causes, such as overfishing and environmental destruction. However, research suggests that fisheries are able to recover or stabilize their populations when responsible management and regulations are in place. Unfortunately, most seafood is obtained through “irresponsible fishing practices that continue to modify some marine ecosystem.” This has resulted in record depleted stocks. For example, “85 percent of the world’s fisheries are fished at or beyond their maximum sustainable limit.” Considering the rising global population and the pressure that it has, and will continue to exert on the Earth's resources, a more sustainable method of fishing is necessary if humans wish to utilize its natural abundance.\n\nThe Sustainable Seafood Movement is an initiative born through the realization that the marine ecosystems of the world were being overexploited and destroyed. It began in the 1990s and was driven by social marketing through Ecolabel and awareness campaigns. Through social marketing, the collaboration between environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and industry allowed for the consumer to make informed choices, potentially contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity.\n\nEcolabeling programs evaluate the production process with environmental standards set by an independent third party. Should the process fulfill the specific requirements, the producer or marketer may purchase a license to use an ecolabel in its marketing. This label allows the consumer to know that the product was produced sustainably. Labeling is not only an effective regulatory tool in encouraging consumers to make environmentally friendly choices, but it also provides a financial benefit to producers. In 1996 the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) implemented the first certification program Since then, they have not only made a distinct effort to maintain the health of ecosystems, but they have also contributed to more financial success for producers. For instance, once the American Albacore Fishing Association had its tuna certified to the MSC standard, they were able to obtain premium prices for their product. For the small fishing community in Bonita, California, certification allowed them to sell direct, as opposed to depending on the instability on the dock. They were able to make a profit of $2,260 rather than $1,700 per tonne. More companies and organizations are choosing to use environmentally sustainable production, such as ecolabeling, to gain a greater market share and higher profits.\n\nAwareness campaigns focus on educating the public and encouraging them to purchase products that consider the vitality of marine species. They do so through boycotts of certain species and products as well as through seafood guides. Seafood guides highlight which species are acceptable to consume and which are not based on their environmental impact. Guides are typically constructed into three categories, some using the analogy of a traffic light's colours: red, yellow, and green. These rankings are based on how the fish responds to fishing pressure, abundance, gear impact, bycatch, and management. Red represents items to avoid, yellow is a good alternative, and green is the best choice. Several organizations, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium, have developed their own guides or wallet cards to be distributed to the public.\n\nIn September 2016, a partnership of Google and Oceana and Skytruth introduced Global Fishing Watch, a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities.\n\nThe Seafood Guide below, made by SeaChoice, highlights which species are best to eat, and which should be avoided based on their management, abundance, and whether they have been caught or farmed in environmentally sustainable ways. It allows consumers to be informed of their choices and vote with their wallets.\n\nThere are a wide variety of fishing methods used. Each has its own environment impact that varies on intensity. The table below highlights a fishing method along with its environmental repercussions.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a national government agency that has authority over conservation, marine fisheries, and management. The NOAA has created FishWatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices. The fisheries in the United States are overseen by the Ten National Standards of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Therefore, the National Standards are protecting the fish population and eliminating overfishing. Along with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, U.S. fisheries are also regulated under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Act.\n\nThe NOAA fisheries service has started using aquaculture to produce sustainable seafood. Aquaculture is fish or shellfish farming. The aquaculture fisheries hatch and raise the fish until market size. By using aquaculture the wild fish will be able to repopulate without the threat of overfishing. The aquaculture fish have a variety of uses including: food, nutritional, and pharmaceutical. Two types of aquaculture exist. Marine aquaculture farms the fish species that live in the ocean and fresh water aquaculture is the fish species that live in freshwater. NOAA is focusing on an alternative seafood source to help repopulate and save the ocean's ecosystems.\n\nThe Marine Stewardship Council is a global non-profit organization looking to conserve the oceans. Their mission is to use a combination of certified fisheries and ecolabeling to make people aware of how important it is to preserve our oceans. The MSC works with fisheries, scientists, seafood companies, conservation groups and the public to encourage environmentally friendly seafood choices. The two main ways the MSC regulates sustainable seafood is by setting standards for certified fisheries and ecolabeling.\n\nThe certified fisheries are judged on the three standards the MSC provides. The MSC, however, does not certify the fisheries. They are certified by a third party system to remove any bias. The standards were created to decrease overfishing and maintain healthy ecosystems.\nThe three standards are:\n\nOnce a fishery has been reviewed and certified, their certification lasts for 5 years. In that 5 years, the fishery will be inspected and held to the environmental standards of the MSC. After the 5 years have passed, the fishery will have to go through the approval process again.\n\nThe second way the MSC regulates seafood to the public is by using their ecolabel. The ecolabel on seafood products guarantees the seafood has come from a sustainable source and certified fishery. The ecolabel can be found around the world. The consumer can feel good about buying seafood with a MSC ecolabel.\n\nBefore a seafood product can carry the MSC eco-label, the fishery must acquire the MSC Fisheries certification. Additionally, all companies in the supply chain that take ownership of the product including distributors, wholesalers, manufacturers, pack houses, traders, retailers, catering organizations and restaurants must acquire the MSC Chain of Custody Certification.\n\nCritics condemn the Marine Stewardship Council for certifying specific fisheries that may be in trouble, harmful to the environment, or where there is a lack of information available. For example, the Antarctic toothfish fishery in the Ross Sea was awarded an MSC label, despite a lack of basic information on the stock itself. A \"Marine Policy\" study that analyzed the stocks of MSC fisheries found that 31% of the stocks were overfished, and 11% did not have suitable information available.\n\nRichard Page, a Greenpeace oceans campaigner stated \"I will go as far as to say consumers are being duped. They think they are buying fish that are sustainable and can eat them with a clean conscience.\" \n\nFriend of the Sea is a non-profit international organization that supports the conservation of oceans. It was founded by Dr. Paolo Bay who started the sustainable seafood movement in Europe. Friends of the Sea uses aquaculture and certified fisheries to maintain the seafood stock. The certified fisheries are audited by International Organization for Standardization. The criteria to become a certified fishery is:\nCurrently 30 fisheries around the world are certified under the Friends of the Sea.\n\nThe Friends of The Sea also participate in the certification of aquaculture. The establishment of aquaculture helps reduce the number of wild species caught. The ISO also audits the aquaculture farms before certification. The criteria of aquaculture is:\nIn 2004, aquaculture accounted for 32% of the total production of fish. Aquaculture is becoming more popular with an 8% rise per year in the last 30 years. Currently there are 75 aquaculture certified by Friends of the Sea.\n\nDue to growing public concern about overfishing, many seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options, with some restaurants specializing in sustainable seafood, exemplified by Miya's, a restaurant headed by chef Bun Lai, a 2016 White House Champions of Change for Sustainable Seafood recipient. Miya's is on the vanguard of the sustainable seafood movement as the first sushi restaurant to specialize in sustainable seafood. Today, there are sustainable sushi restaurants throughout the U.S., Canada, and England, and many more sustainable seafood restaurants in general.Due to eco-labeling, seafood guides, traceability schemes, sourcing policies, and awareness initiatives there are more chefs and restaurants involved in the sustainable seafood movement than ever before.\n\nOrganizations such as Seafood Choices Alliance have helped educate chefs about the choices they make in order to encourage more chefs and restaurants to offer sustainable options. This is in line with the strict international standards set by 'Eco Friendly Chef' www.ecofriendlychef.com and 'Eco Friendly Approved' www.EcoFriendlyApproved.com in association with Oceans 5. www.oceans-5.com\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is presumed to have been used before the Goryeo period. The steamed ingredients are lightly fermented and boiled in a large pot called a \"sot\" (솥) for a long time.\n\n\"Yeot\" boiled for a shorter time is called \"jocheong\" (조청), liquid \"yeot\". This sticky syrup-like \"jocheong\" is usually used as a condiment for cooking and for coating other \"hangwa\", or as a dipping sauce for \"garae tteok\", white cylindrical \"tteok\".\n\nIf boiled for a longer time, the \"yeot\" will solidify when chilled, and is called \"gaeng yeot\" (갱엿). \"Gaeng yeot\" is originally brownish but if stretched (as taffy is prepared), the color lightens.

There are three main types of magnetometer used to measure magnetic anomalies:\n\n\nIn ground-based surveys, measurements are made at a series of stations, typically 15 to 60 m apart. Usually a proton precession magnetometer is used and it is often mounted on a pole. Raising the magnetometer reduces the influence of small ferrous objects that were discarded by humans. To further reduce unwanted signals, they do not carry objects such as keys, knives or compasses. In addition, objects such as motor vehicles, railway lines, and barbed wire fences are avoided. If some such contaminant is overlooked, it often shows up as a sharp spike in the anomaly, so such features are treated with suspicion. The main application for ground-based surveys is detailed search for minerals.\nAirborne magnetic surveys are often used in oil surveys to provide preliminary information for seismic surveys. In some countries such as Canada, government agencies have made systematic surveys of large areas. The survey generally involves making a series of parallel runs at a constant height and intervals of anywhere from a hundred meters to several kilometers. These are crossed by occasional tie lines, perpendicular to the main survey, to check for errors. The plane is a source of magnetism, so sensors are either mounted on a boom (as in the figure) or towed behind on a cable. Aeromagnetic surveys have a lower spatial resolution of ground surveys, but this can be an advantage for a regional survey of deeper rocks.\n\nIn shipborne surveys, a magnetometer is towed a few hundred meters behind a ship in a device called a \"fish\". The sensor is kept at a constant depth of about 15 m. Otherwise, the procedure is similar to that used in aeromagnetic surveys.\n\nThe Sputnik 3 spacecraft in 1958 was the first to carry a magnetometer. In the fall of 1979, Magsat was launched and jointly operated by NASA and USGS until the spring of 1980. It had a caesium vapor scalar magnetometer and a fluxgate vector magnetometer. CHAMP, a German satellite, made precise gravity and magnetic measurements from 2001 to 2010. A Danish satellite, Ørsted, was launched in 1999 and is still in operation, while the Swarm mission of the European Space Agency involves a \"constellation\" of three satellites that were launched in November, 2013.\n\nThere are two main corrections that are needed for magnetic measurements. The first is remove short-term variations in the field from external sources. There are \"diurnal variations\" that have a period of 24 hours and magnitudes of up to 30 nT, probably from the action of the solar wind on the ionosphere. In addition, magnetic storms can have peak magnitudes of 1000 nT and can last for several days. Their contribution can be measured by returning to a base station repeatedly or by having another magnetometer that periodically measures the field at a fixed location.\n\nThe anomaly is the local contribution to the magnetic field, so the main geomagnetic field must be subtracted from it. Usually the International Geomagnetic Reference Field is used for this purpose. This is a large-scale, time-averaged mathematical model of the Earth's field based on measurements from satellites, magnetic observatories and other surveys.\n\nSome corrections that are needed for gravity anomalies are less important for magnetic anomalies. For example, the vertical gradient of the magnetic field is 0.03 nT/m or less, so an elevation correction is generally not needed.\n\nThe magnetization in the surveyed rock is a vector sum of induced and remanent magnetization:\nThe induced magnetization of many minerals is the product of the ambient magnetic field and their magnetic susceptibility :\nSome susceptibilities are given in the table.\n\nMinerals that are diamagnetic or paramagnetic only have an induced magnetization. Ferromagnetic minerals such as magnetite also can carry a remanent magnetization or remanence. This remanence can last for millions of years, so it may be in a completely different direction from the present Earth's field. If a remanence is present, it is difficult to separate from the induced magnetization unless samples of the rock are measured. The ratio of the magnitudes, , is called the Koenigsberger ratio.\n\nMagnetic surveys over the oceans have revealed a characteristic pattern of anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. They involve a series of positive and negative anomalies in the intensity of the magnetic field, forming stripes running parallel to each ridge. They are often symmetric about the axis of the ridge. The stripes are generally tens of kilometers wide, and the anomalies are a few hundred nanoteslas. The source of these anomalies is primarily permanent magnetization carried by titanomagnetite minerals in basalt and gabbros. They are magnetized when ocean crust is formed at the ridge. As magma rises to the surface and cools, the rock acquires a thermoremanent magnetization in the direction of the field. Then the rock is carried away from the ridge by the motions of the tectonic plates. Every few hundred thousand years, the direction of the magnetic field reverses. Thus, the pattern of stripes is a global phenomenon and can be used to calculate the velocity of seafloor spreading.\n\nIn the \"Space Odyssey\" series by Arthur C. Clarke, a series of monoliths are left by extraterrestrials for humans to find them. One near the crater Tycho is found by its unnaturally powerful magnetic field and named \"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly 1\" (TMA-1). One orbiting Jupiter is named TMA-2, and one in the Olduvai Gorge is found in 2513 and retroactively named TMA-0 because it was first encountered by primitive humans.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13810041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13810041", "title": "Bals des victimes", "text": "Bals des victimes\n\nThe Bals des victimes, or victims' balls, were balls that were said to have been put on by dancing societies after the Reign of Terror. To be admitted to these societies and balls, one had to be a near relative of someone who had been guillotined during the Terror. The balls came to prominence after the death of Robespierre, supposedly first being held in early 1795 and first mentioned in popular writing in 1797. While anecdotal evidence attests to the balls' occurrence, and generations of French and non-French historians described them and accepted them as fact, some recent scholarship, citing a near-total lack of primary evidence, argues that they may have been fabrications based on rumor. Historian David Bell concludes: \"The \"bals des victimes\"... never took place — they were an invention of early nineteenth-century Romantic authors.\"\n\nThe \"bals des victimes\" allegedly began as part of a rash of merrymaking and balls that broke out as the Terror came to an end. According to one source, they emerged as an idea of youths whose parents and other near relatives had gone to the guillotine, and to whom the revolution had now restored their relatives' confiscated property. Reveling in the return of fortune they established aristocratic, decadent balls open to themselves alone.\n\nDescriptions of the balls' particulars vary, but the common thread is that they were a cathartic device in which the participants acted out the emotional impact of their relatives' executions and the social upheavals occurring as a result of the revolution. Many who described the balls, often generations afterwards, nevertheless found them a scandalous idea. Whether real or imagined, the very idea of the balls reflected the post-Terror generations' morbid fascination with the horror of the guillotine and the excesses of the French Revolution with its mass executions.\n\nThose who attended the orgiastic balls reportedly wore mourning clothes or elaborate costumes with crepe armbands signifying mourning. Some accounts have both men and women wearing plain but scanty dress in the wake of the impoverishment of the Revolution, at least until the return of their fortunes at which time ball dress became highly elaborate. Others describe women, in the fashion of Merveilleuses, dressing scandalously in Greco-Roman attire, with their feet bare, in sandals, or adorned only by ribbons, a possible allusion to the fact that women often went barefoot to the guillotine. The style of dress at such a ball was known by some as the \"\"costume à la victime\".\" Women, and by some accounts men too, wore a red ribbon or string around their necks at the point of a guillotine blade's impact. Both men and women attending the balls were said to have worn or cut their hair in a fashion that bared their necks in a manner reflecting the haircut given the victim by the executioner, women often using a comb known as a cadenette to achieve this fashion. According to some, this was the origin of the feminine hairstyle known as the \"\"coiffure à la victime\"\" or more popularly the \"\"coiffure à la Titus\"\", or (in England) \"\"a la guillotine\"\". Some sources state that a woman sporting this hairstyle sometimes wore a red shawl or throat ribbon even when not attending a \"bal des victimes\".\n\nIn another macabre touch, instead of a graceful bow or bob of the head to one's dancing partner, a man who attended a \"bal des victimes\" would jerk his head sharply downwards in imitation of the moment of decapitation. Some sources suggest that women, too, adopted this salutation.\n\n\n"}

The most common method is similar to the home cooking process. The rice is blanched in hot water, steamed, and rinsed.

The fast cooking properties come from the fact that, when recooked, water can penetrate into the cracked grain much more quickly.\n\nThe major advantage of instant rice is the rapid cooking time - some brands can be ready in as little as three minutes.\n\nCurrently, several companies, Asian as well as American, have developed brands which only require 90 seconds to cook, much like a cup of instant noodles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13825869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13825869", "title": "Experimental music", "text": "Experimental music\n\nExperimental music is a general label for any music that pushes existing boundaries and genre definitions . Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilites radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music . Elements of experimental music include indeterminate music, in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may also approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incorporate unorthodox and unique elements .\n\nThe practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. John Cage was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing indeterminacy techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, Pierre Schaeffer had begun using the term \"musique expérimentale\" to describe compositional activities that incorporated tape music, musique concrète, and elektronische Musik. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe computer-controlled composition associated with composers such as Lejaren Hiller. Harry Partch as well as Ivor Darreg worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of experimental musical instruments. Musique concrète (French; literally, \"concrete music\"), is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises acousmatic sound as a compositional resource. Free improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid clichés, i.e. overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres.\n\nThe Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète (GRMC), under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer, organized the First International Decade of Experimental Music between 8 and 18 June 1953. This appears to have been an attempt by Schaeffer to reverse the assimilation of musique concrète into the German \"elektronische Musik\", and instead tried to subsume musique concrète, \"elektronische Musik\", tape music, and world music under the rubric \"musique experimentale\" . Publication of Schaeffer's manifesto was delayed by four years, by which time Schaeffer was favoring the term \"recherche musicale\" (music research), though he never wholly abandoned \"musique expérimentale\" (; ).\n\nJohn Cage was also using the term as early as 1955. According to Cage's definition, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\" , and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action . In Germany, the publication of Cage's article was anticipated by several months in a lecture delivered by Wolfgang Edward Rebner at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse on 13 August 1954, titled “Amerikanische Experimentalmusik\". Rebner's lecture extended the concept back in time to include Charles Ives, Edgard Varèse, and Henry Cowell, as well as Cage, due to their focus on sound as such rather than compositional method .\n\nComposer and critic Michael Nyman starts from Cage's definition , and develops the term \"experimental\" also to describe the work of other American composers (Christian Wolff, Earle Brown, Meredith Monk, Malcolm Goldstein, Morton Feldman, Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, etc.), as well as composers such as Gavin Bryars, John Cale, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Cornelius Cardew, John Tilbury, Frederic Rzewski, and Keith Rowe . Nyman opposes experimental music to the European avant-garde of the time (Boulez, Kagel, Xenakis, Birtwistle, Berio, Stockhausen, and Bussotti), for whom \"The identity of a composition is of paramount importance\" . The word \"experimental\" in the former cases \"is apt, providing it is understood not as descriptive of an act to be later judged in terms of success or failure, but simply as of an act the outcome of which is unknown\" .\n\nDavid Cope also distinguishes between experimental and avant garde, describing experimental music as that \"which represents a refusal to accept the status quo\" . David Nicholls, too, makes this distinction, saying that \"...very generally, avant-garde music can be viewed as occupying an extreme position within the tradition, while experimental music lies outside it\" .\n\nWarren Burt cautions that, as \"a combination of leading-edge techniques and a certain exploratory attitude\", experimental music requires a broad and inclusive definition, \"a series of \"ands\", if you will\", encompassing such areas as \"Cageian influences \"and\" work with low technology \"and\" improvisation \"and\" sound poetry \"and\" linguistics \"and\" new instrument building \"and\" multimedia \"and\" music theatre \"and\" work with high technology \"and\" community music, among others, when these activities are done with the aim of finding those musics 'we don't like, yet,' [citing Herbert Brün] in a 'problem-seeking environment' [citing Chris Mann]” .\n\nBenjamin Piekut argues that this \"consensus view of experimentalism\" is based on an \"a priori\" \"grouping\", rather than asking the question \"How have these composers been collected together in the first place, that they can now be the subject of a description?\" That is, \"for the most part, experimental music studies \"describes\" a category without really \"explaining\" it\" . He finds laudable exceptions in the work of David Nicholls and, especially, Amy Beal , and concludes from their work that \"The fundamental ontological shift that marks experimentalism as an achievement is that from representationalism to performativity\", so that \"an explanation of experimentalism that already assumes the category it purports to explain is an exercise in metaphysics, not ontology\" .\n\nLeonard B. Meyer, on the other hand, includes under \"experimental music\" composers rejected by Nyman, such as Berio, Boulez and Stockhausen, as well as the techniques of \"total serialism\" , holding that \"there is no single, or even pre-eminent, experimental music, but rather a plethora of different methods and kinds\" .\n\nIn the 1950s, the term \"experimental\" was often applied by conservative music critics—along with a number of other words, such as \"engineers art\", \"musical splitting of the atom\", \"alchemist's kitchen\", \"atonal\", and \"serial\"—as a deprecating jargon term, which must be regarded as \"abortive concepts\", since they did not \"grasp a subject\" . This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions . In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a \"new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment.\" He concludes, \"There is no such thing as experimental music … but there is a very real distinction between sterility and invention\" . Starting in the 1960s, \"experimental music\" began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, \"outsider\" composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the \"genre's\" own definition the work it includes is \"radically different and highly individualistic\" . It is therefore not a genre, but an open category, \"because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial\" . Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance \"guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common\" .\n\nIn the late 1950s, Lejaren Hiller and L. M. Isaacson used the term in connection with computer-controlled composition, in the scientific sense of \"experiment\" : making predictions for new compositions based on established musical technique . The term \"experimental music\" was used contemporaneously for electronic music, particularly in the early \"musique concrète\" work of Schaeffer and Henry in France . There is a considerable overlap between Downtown music and what is more generally called experimental music, especially as that term was defined at length by Nyman in his book \"Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond\" (1974, second edition 1999).\n\nA number of early 20th-century American composers, seen as precedents to and influences on John Cage, are sometimes referred to as the \"American Experimental School\". These include Charles Ives, Charles and Ruth Crawford Seeger, Henry Cowell, Carl Ruggles, and John Becker (; ).\n\nArtists: John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, Morton Feldman, David Tudor, Related: Merce Cunningham\n\nMusique concrète (French; literally, \"concrete music\"), is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises acousmatic sound as a compositional resource. The compositional material is not restricted to the inclusion of sonorities derived from musical instruments or voices, nor to elements traditionally thought of as \"musical\" (melody, harmony, rhythm, metre and so on). The theoretical underpinnings of the aesthetic were developed by Pierre Schaeffer, beginning in the late 1940s.\n\nFluxus was an artistic movement started in the 1960s, characterized by an increased theatricality and the use of mixed media. Another known musical aspect appearing in the Fluxus movement was the use of Primal Scream at performances, derived from the primal therapy. Yoko Ono used this technique of expression .\n\nThe term \"experimental\" has sometimes been applied to the mixture of recognizable music genres, especially those identified with specific ethnic groups, as found for example in the music of Laurie Anderson, Chou Wen-chung, Steve Reich, Kevin Volans, Martin Scherzinger, Michael Blake, and Rüdiger Meyer (; ; ).\n\nFree improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid overt references to recognizable musical genres. The term is somewhat paradoxical, since it can be considered both as a technique (employed by any musician who wishes to disregard rigid genres and forms) and as a recognizable genre in its own right.\n\nThe Residents started in the seventies as an idiosyncratic musical group mixing all kinds of artistic genres like pop music, electronic music, experimental music with movies, comic books and performance art . Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca composed multi guitar compositions in the late 1970s. Chatham worked for some time with LaMonte Young and afterwards mixed the experimental musical ideas with punk rock in his piece \"Guitar Trio\". Lydia Lunch started incorporating spoken word with punk rock and Mars explored new sliding guitar techniques. Arto Lindsay neglected to use any kind of musical practise or theory to develop an idiosyncratic atonal playing technique. DNA and James Chance are other famous no wave artists. Chance later on moved more up to Free improvisation. The No Wave movement was closely related to transgressive art and, just like Fluxus, often mixed performance art with music. It is alternatively seen, however, as an avant-garde offshoot of 1970s punk, and a genre related to experimental rock .\n\n\n"}

It had no dampers, so the strings vibrated sympathetically, giving a rich resonating tone that was quite novel at the time and made a noticeable stir; the lack of dampers however made articulation difficult.\n\nFew instruments were constructed and very few survive. Hebenstreit and his two best pupils Maximilian Hellmann and Johann Baptist Gumpenhuber were essentially the only virtuoso players of the instrument. However it was well known in French and German musical circles of the early 18th century, and Hebenstreit gained fame and fortune playing it.\n\nHebenstreit named the instrument after himself. Glowing reviews of its qualities appear in the writings of a number of prominent commentators of the day, such as Johann Kuhnau.

Other fillings include \"kkaennip\" (perilla leaves), scallions, \"doenjang\" (soybean paste), kimchi, and soybean sprouts.\n\nRegional varieties include \"abai-sundae\" () from the Hamgyong and Pyongan Provinces, \"Kaesong-sundae\" () from Kaesong, \"Baegam-sundae\" () from Yongin, \"Jeju-sundae\" () from Jeju Island, \"Byeongcheon-sundae\" () from Chungcheong Province, and \"amppong-sundae\" () from Jeolla Province.\n\nSome varieties use seafood as casing. \"Ojingeo-sundae\" (), made with fresh squid, is a local specialty of Gangwon, while \"mareun-ojingeo-sundae\" () made with dried squid is eaten in Gangwon as well as Gyeonggi. \"Myeongtae-sundae\" (), made with Alaska pollock is a local specialty of Gangwon and Hamgyong. \"Eogyo-sundae\" () is made with the swim bladder of brown croakers.\n\nIn South Korea, \"sundae\" is often steamed and served with steamed offals such as \"gan\" (liver) and \"heopa\" (lung). Sliced pieces of \"sundae\" and sides are dipped in salt-black pepper mixture (Seoul), in vinegar-gochujang mixture (Honam), seasoned soybean paste in Yeongnam, and soy sauce in Jeju. As \"sundae\" is often sold in \"bunsikjip,\" along with \"tteok-bokki\" (stir-fried rice cakes) and \"twigim\" (fritters), it is also dipped in \"tteok-bokki\" sauce. Many \"bunsikjip\" offer \"tteok-twi-sun\", a set menu with \"tteok-bokki\", \"twigim\" and \"sundae\".\n\n\n"}

It is, along with the cross, one of the two main punches that count in the statistics as \"power punches\".\n\nUppercuts are useful when thrown at close range, because they are considered to cause more damage. Additionally, it is likely that a boxer would miss if the uppercut is thrown when the opponents are apart. Uppercuts usually do more damage when landed to the chin, but they can also cause damage when thrown to the body (particularly the solar plexus) or when landing on the nose or eyes.\n\nThe punch moves as its name implies: it usually initiates from the attacker's belly, making an upward motion that resembles a pirate's hook in shape, before landing on the opponent's face or body. In a conventional boxing combination, it is the second punch thrown, after the jab, but it can either initiate or finish a combination.\n\nWhen performing an uppercut, the attacker should stay close to the target, so as to prevent the opponent from detecting that the punch is coming, and countering with a straight punch. An uppercut from the outside also loses some of its power because the arm is no longer bent at the elbow and cannot effectively transfer the total body's force in the upward movement.\n\nSamuel Elias, also known as \"Dutch Sam\", is credited with creating this punch originally called an \"undercut\". It was reported that \"Dutch Sam created havoc with the new blow until a new way was found to block it\". Boxers famous for their uppercuts include Lennox Lewis, Joe Louis, Wilfredo Gómez, Julio César Chávez, Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Rubén Olivares, and Sandy Saddler.\n"}

The more general term of \"tuna sandwich\" may also refer to cuisine utilizing filet of raw or cooked tuna, rather than canned tuna.\n\nIn the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches. The tuna fish sandwich has been called \"the mainstay of almost everyone's American childhood,\" and \"the staple of the snatched office lunch for a generation.\"\n\nA tuna fish sandwich is usually made with canned tuna mixed with mayonnaise and other ingredients, such as chopped celery, pickles or pickle relish, hard-boiled eggs, onion, cucumber, sweetcorn, and/or black olives. Other recipes may use olive oil, Miracle Whip, salad cream, mustard, or yogurt instead of or in addition to mayonnaise. The sandwich may be topped with lettuce, tomato or other vegetables and fruits, such as cucumbers, bean sprouts or avocado in any combination.\n\nA small standard can of tuna preserved in water weighs 5 ounces, but only 4 ounces when drained. Therefore it contains two 2-ounce servings and can make two sandwiches.

{"id": "13848978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13848978", "title": "Sponge and dough", "text": "Sponge and dough\n\nThe sponge and dough method is a two-step bread making process: in the first step a \"sponge\" is made and allowed to ferment for a period of time, and in the second step the \"sponge\" is added to the \"final dough's\" ingredients, creating the \"total formula\". In this usage, synonyms for \"sponge\" are \"yeast starter\" or \"yeast pre-ferment\". In French baking the \"sponge and dough\" method is known as \"levain-levure\". The method is reminiscent of the sourdough or \"levain\" methods; however, the sponge is made from all fresh ingredients prior to being used in the final dough.\n\nA sponge ferment is usually a sticky process that uses part of the flour, part or all of the water, and part or all of the yeast of a total- or straight-dough formula. Highly liquid sponges of batter consistencies are mixed with a whip, spoon, or fork. Lower hydration, stiffer sponges are lightly mixed or kneaded just until the dough begins to develop. The sponge is allowed to rest and ferment for a period of time in an environment of a desired temperature and humidity. When the sponge's fermentation time has elapsed or it has reached a desired volumetric growth characteristic, the \"final dough's\" ingredients are added. The \"gluten is developed\" in the mixing or kneading process, and it may then be processed through further \"work\" and \"rest\" cycles before being \"proofed\" then baked.\n\nThe sum of the sponge and final dough's ingredients represents the total formula. A generic 65% pre-fermented flour sponge-and-dough formula using bakers' percentages follows:\n\nThe sponge's fermentation time depends on its temperature and that of the surrounding area, the ingredients used, and the percentage amount of yeast. It ferments in a humid environment at , where it may \"rise\" and expand to 4-5 times its original volume, when it \"falls\" it has reached 66-70% of its allotted time.\n\nOne significant decision the baker must make when designing such a formula, or adapting a \"direct\" or \"straight-dough\" formula or recipe, is to decide the sponge-to-dough flour ratio. While the relative amounts of ingredients used may vary, the method remains the same.\n\nThe sponge method is used for 3 different reasons: taste, texture and chemistry.\n\nThe flavour that is created is dependent on the ingredients used and the fermenting yeast. Just like sourdough, the longer the ferment, the greater the taste difference.\n\nSponge doughs were used before bread improvers were invented. Texture is partly a byproduct of the chemistry going on in the fermentation, which does several important things such as activate the different enzymes (protease and amylase) needed to leaven bread. Modern grain-harvesting practices have reduced the naturally occurring enzymes that grains had in former times, a result of no-longer-used grain-storage processes, so today small amounts of enzymes are routinely added to flour by manufacturers, often in the form of malted barley or sprouted grain.\n\nProteases, dependent on their time of action and concentration levels, soften the gluten in the dough, hydrolyzing peptide bonds, increasing dough \"extensibility\" which allows the protein matrix to stretch out as the mix expands, thus leading to increased baked volumes and better structure.\n\nMany bread recipes call for a sponge method, especially traditional French breads. Some examples of breads that use the sponge method:\n\n\n"}

Some cookbooks and authors have used leaves and twigs of the camphor plant in smoking due to the dish's name, but this is a misunderstanding. Due to its complicated preparation, Zhangcha duck was eaten more often at banquets or festive events than as a daily household dish.\n\nThe duck is first marinated for several hours with a rub containing a typical combination of whole or crushed Sichuan pepper, \"huangjiu\" or \"baijiu\" (fermented or distilled Chinese wine), ginger, garlic, and salt, with much of it rubbed inside the cavity of the duck. For intensity of taste, sometimes the marinade rub is augmented with choujiu, black pepper, tea leaves, and camphor leaves. Following the marination, the duck is quickly blanched in hot water to tighten the skin, and then towel and air dried. This step ensures that the skin of the duck will not turn bitter during smoking. A wok is then prepared for smoking the duck with black tea leaves. Following a smoke treatment of approximately 10–15 minutes, the duck is then steamed for another 10 minutes before being deep fried in vegetable oil until its skin is crisp.\n\nThe duck is consumed wrapped in clam-shaped buns called \"gua bao\" (割包).\n\n"}

While other forms of the Brandy Sour cocktail exist, the Cypriot variety is a distinct mixture, which only shares the basic brandy and lemon flavourings with other variants. Both brandy and lemons are among Cyprus's major exports, and both have distinctive Cypriot characteristics.\n\nThe Cypriot Brandy Sour style was developed following the introduction of the first blended brandy made on Cyprus, by the Haggipavlu family, in the early 1930s. The cocktail was developed at the Forest Park Hotel, in the hill-resort of Plátres, for the young King Farouk of Egypt, who often stayed at the hotel during his frequent visits to the island. The Brandy Sour was introduced as an alcoholic substitute for iced tea, as a way of disguising the Muslim monarch's preference for Western-style cocktails. The drink subsequently spread to other bars and hotels in the fashionable Platres area, before making its way to the coastal resorts of Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia, and the capital Nicosia.\n\nA typical recipe for a Cypriot Brandy Sour should include:\n\n\nCocktail brandy produced in Cyprus is typically less strongly flavoured than cognac or armagnac, and most brands have a caramel-biased aftertaste balance. Cyprus also produces distinctive, yellow-green coloured, bitter lemons — used by British author Lawrence Durrell for the title for his autobiographical novel \"Bitter Lemons of Cyprus\". These lemons are used locally to produce a bitter-sweet lemon cordial, which forms the sour and bitter base for the Brandy Sour cocktail. Bitters are added to taste, and while the locally produced \"Cock Drops\" brand is widely available on the island, the internationally recognised \"Angostura\" brand is increasingly used. These ingredients are added to a tall glass and stirred, before the glass is topped up with lemonade (for a classic, slightly sweeter drink) or soda water (for less sweetness and a more pronounced brandy flavour), and plenty of ice.\n\n"}

He moved into rooms above the confectioners Van Haaren & Nieuwerkerk.\nHe was addicted to coffee and the story goes that one night he left his coffee with sugar and cream on the heater, where it evaporated. On tasting the resulting substance, he loved it.\nHis doctor advised him not to drink coffee so he asked the confectioner Theodorus van Haaren to make him some \"lumps of coffee\". After some experimenting, Van Haaren created a sweet made of coffee, caramel, cream and butter. The enthusiastic Baron Hop was keen to let his guests try his 'Hopjes', which quickly gained popularity. Van Haaren's successor eventually even got orders from abroad.\n\nA typical characteristic of the hopje is that it does not stick and that it does not go soft over time. The Hague had a museum called \"Museum voor het Haagsche Hopje\", which is dedicated to the hopje and its history, which has now closed down. J.P. Rademaker copied the hopjes and marketed them as \"the only real Haagsche Hopjes\". He was the first to wrap the individual sweets in printed paper, which was not usual at the time.

Today, this cake is known more as a classic Chinese pastry rather than a wedding gift because it has lost most of its original significance due to cultural change. It can be found in Hong Kong and in some Chinatowns overseas.\n\nThe cake is essentially a lightly sweetened sponge cake that may take any number of shapes or appearances. It is considered large compared to the size of most pastries. The internal base of the cake may consist of lotus seed paste.\n\n\"Marry girl cake\" is a traditional wedding gift which is originally from Guangdong. According to tradition, the giving of wedding cakes by the bridegroom shows that he is respectful and takes his vows seriously. The bridegroom sends \"marry girl cakes\" to the bride and her family after the engagement. This \"remittance of the big gifts\" \"gwo daai lai\" (過大禮, \") seals the engagement. The bride's family will then give them to their relatives to share the happiness and tell them that the wedding is approaching. The cakes are given in packs of four, six or eight pieces, because even numbers in general, and those numbers in particular, are deemed to be auspicious.\n\nThe importance of giving out \"marry girl cakes\" is illustrated by an anecdote dating from the era of the Three Kingdoms. At that time, Liu Bei had borrowed a place called Jingzhou for a long period of time and seemed in no hurry to return it to its owner, Sun Quan. Thus, Sun Quan's advisor, Zhou Yu, suggested a \"honey trap\". Sun Quan pretended that he was offering Liu Bei his recently widowed sister as a wife. Liu Bei had to leave Jingzhou for Soochow to attend the ceremony. He knew it was a trick, however, after arriving in Soochow, he told his soldiers to deliver cakes to Sun Quan. This move forced Sun Quan to accept the alliance as sealed. Since then, the Chinese follow the custom of sending \"marry girl cakes\" to share their happiness with family and friends.\n\nThe sponge cake is not the only type of \"marry girl cake\", there are around 30-40 types with different tastes and distinct ingredients. Moreover, a new cake appeared recently, called \"great-grandmother cake\" (太婆餅), to be sent as a sign of extra respect if the bride's grandparents are still alive. \n\nThe most popular types are :\n\nThere are lots of ingredients needed to make red lotus seed paste pastry(紅綾蓮蓉酥) (8 pieces). As to make the oil skin, solid vegetable oil 15g, flour 70g, syrup 15g, water 30g, and a little pigment. For making the butter, flour 90g and solid vegetable oil 55g are needed. Lastly, lotus seed paste 300g are used to create the inside part of it.\n\nFirst, mix the ingredients of oil skin and soft creamy butter separately, and then evenly divide into 8 parts. Press the oil skin into a flat shape and wrap in butter. Then, use a long stick to roll, turn 90 degrees left and right to the middle and fold into three layers. Press into cakes skin, put lotus seed paste inside and turn it into a cake shape. Put it in an oven for 25–30 minutes, under 180 degrees.\n\nAlthough marry girl cake has a long history, people in modern society still keep it as a sign of \"happiness\" and send wedding cakes to relatives and close friends when there is a marriage. There are different styles and flavors of marry girl cakes now, which shows the popularity of it. Moreover, there is a new cake in recent years called great-grandmother cake(太婆餅). If the bride's grandparents are still there, the bridegroom will send these kinds of cakes to the girl's place to show good faith.\n\n"}

Situated on high-quality soil, the area provided fine wheat for flour, while nearby villages provided honey. The necessary spices were brought from remote countries, mainly India, via a route through the Black Sea and Lwów to the Holy Roman Empire, where the spices were transported by north-German trade companies. Some also came by sea to the port of Danzig.\n\nThe very first mention of Toruń gingerbread comes from 1380 and speaks of a local baker called Niclos Czana. The product quickly gained fame across Poland and abroad. Toruń and the city of Nuremberg, itself famous for special pancakes, were eager to protect the secrets of their recipes from each other. Finally in 1556, they formed an agreement by which each city could bake the specialties of the other.\n\nThe artisans weren't the only ones engaged in the production of the delicacy. In the 16th century, the Cistercian Order on the outskirts of Toruń prospered mainly due to this activity and even sold their product to other countries. During the 17th century, the well-known workshop of the Grauer family appeared. The city authorities were supportive of the lucrative trade and issued several tax breaks on spice imports and export by bakers' guilds so that the trade could be increased.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century, the city saw a fall in baking and other craftsmanship. In 1825, only three bakers were left. With the advent of capitalism, large companies took over from the local craftsmen and mass production of the gingerbread ensued.\n\nThe largest factory was owned by Gustav Weese, based on tradition dating from 1763, when Johann Weese started to bake gingerbread. Gustav Traugott Weese inherited a small workshop after his father Andreas in 1824 and changed it into a large company. In 1875 the Toruń Gazette (\"Gazeta Toruńska\") wrote on New Year's Eve that due to the demand it was even sold in Africa. Other exotic places of export included Turkey, Japan, China and Honolulu. In 1913, Gustav Weese, a descendant of Gustav Traugott Weese, constructed a factory which, after World War I ended, was employing over 500 workers. Gustav Weese sold it in January 1939 to the Polish company \"Społem\" and left for his other gingerbread factory in Germany. The company in Toruń still exists and is the oldest confectionery company in Poland today and one of the oldest in the world.\n\nBesides Gustav's factory there was also the Hermann Thomas company founded in 1857, which in 1907 employed 200 workers. Another important company engaged in the production of gingerbread was founded by Jan Ruchniewicz in 1907. The enterprise prospered quite successfully and had 50 workers. It was especially known for the ornamental gingerbread topped with Toruń's crest.\n\n\"Pierniki Toruńskie\", as they are known in Polish, are an icon of Poland's national cuisine. They have traditionally been presented as a gift by the city of Toruń to Polish leaders, artists and others who have distinguished themselves in Polish society, and to Polish kings. Baking molds survive with likenesses of king Sigismund III of Poland, king Władysław IV Vasa and Queen Cecilia Renata as well as the royal seal with the Polish eagle and crests of several provinces. Other notables who have received gift gingerbread from the city include Marie Casimire Louise (French princess and widow of King John III Sobieski), Napoléon Bonaparte (during whose visit the whole city was illuminated and bells were rung all over the city), Zygmunt Krasiński (one of Poland's Three Bards), painter Jan Matejko, actress Helena Modjeska, Marshal Józef Piłsudski, pianist Artur Rubinstein, poet Czesław Miłosz, Lech Wałęsa and Pope John Paul II.\n\nSince at least the Middle Ages, \"pierniki\" have been connected with Toruń in Polish proverbs and legends. One legend claims that gingerbread was a gift from the Queen of the Bees to the apprentice Bogumił. A 17th-century epigram by poet Fryderyk Hoffman speaks of the four best things in Poland: \"The vodka of Gdańsk, Toruń gingerbread, the ladies of Kraków, and the Warsaw shoes\".\n\nThe 18th-century poet and fabulist Ignacy Krasicki, who greatly favored the gingerbread, wrote of them in his celebrated poems.\n\nWhen the precocious 15-year-old composer Frédéric Chopin visited Szafarnia, a small village near the river Drwęca, he stopped over in Toruń, where he was a guest of his godfather, the penologist Fryderyk Florian Skarbek. Chopin sampled the city's famous confection and grew so fond of it that he wrote a letter about it to his friends and colleagues. He even sent some to Warsaw. In honor of this, Poland's largest producer of Toruń gingerbread, the \"Kopernik Confectionery Company\", has created a special heart-shaped gingerbread called \"Scherzo\", bearing Chopin's likeness on the wrapper.\n\nToruń holds an annual celebration of gingerbread called \"Święto Piernika\" (the Gingerbread Festival).\n\nThere are two main producers of Toruń gingerbread: the confectionery factory \"Kopernik\" S.A., and the Toruń Bakery. The first upholds its legal rights to the brand name and is the successor to a company that was founded in 1763 by Johann Weese. The second company was formed by Toruń bakers who specialized in producing gingerbread; its aim is to spread knowledge of the craft and to produce fine gingerbread for restaurants, parties and elite meetings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13954016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13954016", "title": "Silat", "text": "Silat\n\nSilat is a collective word for a class of indigenous martial arts from the geo-cultural area of Southeast Asia, more precisely in the Indonesian Archipelago, a region known locally as \"Nusantara\". It is traditionally practised in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, portions of the Philippines, southern part of Thailand and central part of Vietnam. There are hundreds of different styles (\"aliran\") and schools (\"perguruan\") but they tend to focus either on strikes, joint manipulation, weaponry, or some combination thereof. \n\nSilat is one of the sports included in the Southeast Asian Games and other region-wide competitions. Silat first made its debut in 1987 Southeast Asian Games and 2018 Asian Games, both were held in Indonesia as the home and the real land of Silat. Training halls are overseen by separate national organisations in each of the main countries the art is practised. These organisations are \"Ikatan Pencak Silat Indonesia\" (IPSI) from Indonesia, \"Persekutuan Silat Kebangsaan Malaysia\" (PESAKA) from Malaysia, \"Persekutuan Silat Brunei Darussalam\" (PERSIB) from Brunei and \"Persekutuan Silat Singapura\" (PERSISI) from Singapore. Practitioners are called \"pesilat\".\n\nWhile the word \"silat\" is used by Malay-speakers throughout Southeast Asia, the art is officially called pencak silat in Indonesia. The word \"silat\" has been adopted worldwide in reference to professional competitive silat for sport, similar to the Chinese word wushu. Regional dialect names include \"penca\" (West Java), \"dika\" or \"padik\" (Thailand), \"silek\" (the Minangkabau pronunciation of silat), \"main-po\" or \"maen po\" (in the lower speech of Sundanese), and \"gayong\" or \"gayung\" (used in parts of Malaysia and Sumatra). The clear distinction between Indonesian and Peninsular silat is a relatively recent one based mainly on post-independence patriotic sentiments. The term silat Melayu (\"Malay silat\") was originally used in reference to Riau but is today commonly used for referring to systems created on the Southeast Asian mainland. Generally speaking, silat Melayu is often associated with fixed hand positions, low stances, and slow dance-like movements. While this generalisation does not necessarily reflect the reality of silat techniques, it has had a notable influence on the stereotypical way the art is portrayed in Malaysia, Singapore, and to some extent Brunei.\n\nThe origin of the word \"silat\" is uncertain. The Malay term \"silat\" is linked to Minangkabau Indonesia word \"silek\", thus a Sumatran origin of the term is likely. It possibly related to silambam, the Tamil martial art which has been recorded as being practiced in Malaysia since at least the fifteenth century in Malacca. The preset forms of silambam are known as \"silatguvarisai\". The most popular theory in Malaysia is that it derives from \"sekilat\" meaning \"as (fast as) lightning.\"\n\nOther theories derive silat from the Sanskrit \"sīla\" meaning morality or principle, or the Southern Chinese \"saula\" which means to push or perform with the hands. The Sanskrit theory is particularly popular in Thailand, as \"sila\" is an alternate form of the word silat in that country. Other similar-sounding words have been proposed, but are generally not considered by etymologists. One example is \"si elat\" which means someone who confuses, deceives or bluffs. A similar term, \"ilat\", means an accident, misfortune or a calamity. Yet another similar-sounding word is \"silap\" meaning wrong or error. Some styles contain a set of techniques called \"Langkah Silap\" designed to lead the opponent into making a mistake.\n\nIn its proper usage in the languages of its origin, silat is often a general term for any fighting style. This is still common in Indonesia where in some regions both \"silat\" and \"kuntao\" are traditionally interchangeable.\n\nA number of stories exist detailing the history of particular styles, which are often used as origin myths for silat in general. One such tale is of a woman named Rama Sukana who witnessed a fight between a tiger and a large hawk. By using the animals' movements, she was able to fend off a group of drunken men that attacked her. She then taught the techniques to her husband Rama Isruna from whom they were formally passed down. There are several variations of this story depending on the region where it is told. On the island of Boyan (Bawean), Rama Sukana is believed to have watched monkeys fighting each other while the Sundanese of West Java believe that she saw a monkey battle a tiger.\n\nThe legend in the Malay Peninsula is where the heroine is named Teemoh. The daughter of a raja in the Indonesian Archipelago, her husband is a possessive man named Uma. In this version, Teemoh tries to scare away a white-rumped shama or \"murai batu\" (more than one of them in some versions) that flies at her as she bathes. With each move the bird makes, she attempts to wave it off with her hands, and spins as it flies around her. Rather than fighting off drunken men, Teemoh fends off her own husband who tries to beat her with a stick for taking so long. The fact that this legend attributes silat to a woman reflects the prominence of women in traditional Southeast society, as can still be seen in the matriachal \"adat pepatih\" custom of West Sumatra.\n\nAnother legend tells of three Minangkabau warriors from West Sumatra, Indonesia. By their masters' instruction, the young men were travelling north in the hope of attaining moksa (enlightenment). On their journey, they were caught up in a bloody battle near the Siamese border. One of the three was wounded but managed to escape into a forest. Following a stream, he reached a waterfall where he stopped to rest. The warrior noticed a lotus flower come down the waterfall but even as it was pushed below the surface by the waterfall, the lotus would float back up completely intact. The warrior tried throwing a stone and then a stick at the lotus, both with the same result. Finally he went into the water and tried slashing at it with his sword but the lotus would only swirl away, still unharmed. The exhausted warrior then fell into the water and upon climbing out, he contemplated how this principle of overcoming the hard with the soft could be applied to battle. He subsequently created a method of silat with his two compatriots. This story is often told in the Malay Peninsula either as the origin of a particular lineage or to explain the spread of silat from the Minangkabau heartland into Indochina. Minangkabau style silat called \"Silek Minang\" influenced the style of silat in \nNegeri Sembilan in Malay Peninsula. \n\nThe time period for this tale is generally believed to be the 14th century. However, a later version with a more Islamic setting places it during the 17th century. In this version, the three men are named Burhanuddin, Shamsuddin and Aminuddin. Rather than a quest north for enlightenment, they journey to Aceh where Islam has recently been introduced in order to learn more about the new religion. Their status as warriors is not mentioned, nor a battle. Instead, Burhanuddin is filling a water jar when he sees the lotus blossom. He then thought he heard a voice from the tree telling him to teach others what he learned. Upon returning home, each of the three men became religious teachers. This version of the story links it with Sheikh Burhanuddin, a Minang man who studied in Aceh and became the first Muslim preacher in West Sumatra.\n\nThe silat tradition is mostly oral, having been passed down almost entirely by word of mouth. In the absence of written records, much of its history is known only through myth and archaeological evidence. The earliest weapons found in the Nusantara were sharpened stone tools such as axes. Influence from Laos, Vietnam, India, China and Myanmar arrived during the Neolithic period. Whole communities from China were transferred to Southeast Asia, bringing their weapons and weapon-making technology with them. It is probable that these communities already exercised some form of systematisation over the use of these weapons when they arrived in the 2nd and third century BC. Similarities have been observed between Southeast Asian sea-nomads and southeastern Chinese boat-dwellers such as the Baiyue and Tanka people. Examples include the long-boat culture, war fleets, tattoos, familiarity with plant poisons, and bladed weaponry. The Baiyue adopted the use of bronze from northern China and in turn introduced it to Tonkin and Vietnam, resulting in the Đông Sơn culture of the Bronze Age. From Dongson the technology was diffused into Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula giving rise to steel weapons such as broadswords, spears, and knives. The iconic kris was patterned after the Dongson dagger.\n\nThe earliest evidence of a more organised silat comes from the Riau-Lingga archipelago, which acted as a land bridge between the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. Located between Singapore and Sumatra island, the local population gathered great mobility in small boats. The journeys of these sea-nomads regularly extended as far as the Maluku Islands in the east, the Lesser Sunda Islands in the south, and Tenasserim Island in Myanmar. At some point or another they came into contact with the Thais, Malays, Toraja, Chinese, Bugis, Moluccans, Madurese, Dayaks, Sulu, Burmese and orang asli until they spread across the Indonesian Archipelago. Their heterogeneous systems of combat are termed silat Melayu. Practiced since at least the 6th century, they formed the basis for the fighting arts of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, southern Thailand, and most of Indonesia. From its birthplace of Riau, silat quickly spread to the Srivijaya empire and the Minangkabau capital of Pariaman, both powers known for their military might. Srivijaya in particular propagated silat as it extended its rule not only throughout Sumatra but into Java, Borneo, Cambodia, and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThe influence of both India and China were fundamental to the development of silat. By adopting the Indian faiths of Hinduism and Buddhism, Southeast Asian social structure became more organised. Images of Hindu-Buddhist figures such as Durga, Krishna and scenes from the Ramayana all bear testament to the Indian influence on local weapons and armour. Forms are said to have been introduced by the Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma who came to Southeast Asia via the Srivijayan capital of Palembang. Many of silat's medicinal practices and weapons originated in either India or China. The slapping actions in silat \"jurus\" (in which the practitioner slaps their own body) are reminiscent of Indian martial arts. Some form of wrestling is indeed portrayed in Indonesian temple art. The martial arts practised by the Chinese community of Southeast Asia are referred to as kuntao.\n\nThe Book of Liang mentions a kingdom called Poling or Poli southeast of Guangdong. Thought to be located in the Malay Peninsula, the people of this kingdom are said to have customs identical with Cambodia and the same produce as Siam. Their weapons are purportedly the same as China with the exception of the chakram which locals are said to be highly skilled with. Art associated with the candi of Indonesia displays the weapons of the time. Among the weapons featured in murals are swords, shields, bows, clubs, spears, kris, and halberds. The carved dvarapala (gate guards) found in temples around the region are ogres armed with clubs and swords. Between the 11th and 14th centuries, silat reached its peak under Majapahit. Founded by Raden Wijaya after repelling the Mongols, the empire united all of Indonesia's islands and extended its influence into peninsular Malaysia. Silat was and in some cases still is used by the defence forces of various Southeast Asian kingdoms and states in what are now Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei.\n\nFolklore commonly credits the promulgation of silat to pendeta or Hindu-Buddhist sages, often through the study of animals and the natural world. The priests were said to combine the animal movements with meditative postures (semadi) and mystic hand positions (mudra), much like the kuji-in of ninjutsu. The animal-based concept was most likely adopted from Indian martial arts. The village shamans or dukun would often learn silat both as part of their craft and for defending themselves while travelling. Bomoh in some communities such as the Kadayan are required to complete their training in silat before they are initiated. Silat is still an integral aspect of healing rituals such as \"main puteri\". Through this connection, silat is used as a method of spiritual training in addition to self-defense. Systems exist which focus exclusively on the internal rather than the physical, such as the Joduk style of Bali.\n\nNomadic boat-dwellers in Southeast Asia and southeastern China were often miscontrued as pirates for political reasons, but Faxian and Zhao Rugua both described fierce warriors armed with an arsenal of weapons who would attack passing boats around Singapore, Sumatra, Java, and the South China Sea. Local rulers like Parameswara relied on the local boat-people to maintain control of their territory, and they played a key role in the region's power struggles even into the colonial era. True piracy saw an increase after the arrival of the European colonists, who recorded Malay pirates armed with sabres, kris and spears across the archipelago even into the Gulf of Siam. The Haijin or maritime ban in Ming China further spurred the migration of Chinese to Southeast Asia. Marooned Cantonese and Hokkien naval officers would set up small gangs for protection along river estuaries and recruit local silat practitioners as foot soldiers known as \"lang\" or \"lanun\" (Malay for pirate). Chinese pirates like Liang Daoming and Chen Zuyi became so successful that they managed to come into positions of leadership. Whether pirates or not, Southeast Asia's boat people were crucial to the accumulation of weapons and techniques in silat. Through their journeys they acquired weapons from across the region, came into contact with other fighting styles, and spread silat into Brunei.\n\nSoutheast Asian trade had already extended into Okinawa and Japan by the 15th century. The number of Japanese people travelling the region increased after the Battle of Sekigahara. By the early 17th century there were small Japanese communities living and trading in Indochina. Some arrived with the official red seal ships while others were warriors and pirates from the losing side of the Sekigahara war. Although mostly confined to Siam, some Japanese escaped to Cambodia and Indonesia after the Ayutthaya Kingdom was attacked by the Burmese. Silat shares many similarities with Okinawan karate as well as the throws and stances of weapon-based Japanese martial arts which probably date back to this time. Trade with Japan ended when the country went into self-imposed isolation but resumed during the Meiji era, during which time certain areas of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore became home to a small Japanese population. After the Japanese Occupation, some silat masters incorporated the katana into their systems.\n\nAs India came under the rule of conquerors from Central Asia and the Middle East, the Indian traders who frequented Southeast Asia introduced knives of Arabian origin to the western coast of the Indonesian Archipelago. Indian-Muslim blades brought a Moorish influence to the shape of a few local knives, most strongly seen in Aceh. These weapons, sometimes erroneously called \"Muslim weaponry\", spread into Sulawesi and West Malaysia by the 19th century. The only notable examples of such blades are the \"jambia\" and the \"karis\", the latter being a short Acehnese hook-like knife (not to be confused with the indigenous kris).\n\nSince the Islamisation movement of the 1980s and 90s, there have been attempts to make silat more compliant with modern Muslim beliefs and practices. Many instructors justify this by creating new histories to tie their style with Islam and distance themselves from traditional folklore. Some Malaysian silat schools go so far as refusing to teach non-Muslims, or to perform at non-Muslim weddings. This has given rise to various misconceptions that silat is inherently Muslim or can only be practised by followers of the Islamic faith. In actuality, the Hindu-Buddhist and animistic roots of the art were never eradicated, and remain very evident even among Muslim practitioners. As a result of this modern trend, many traditional practices and styles have become increasingly rare. It is now illegal for Muslim practitioners in Malaysia to chant mantra, bow to idols, or attempt to acquire supernatural powers. Traditional meditation is sometimes also discouraged or altered, and the incantations spoken before training or during massage are now often replaced with prayer recitation.\n\nPrior to the introduction of firearms, weapons training was actually considered to be of greater value than unarmed techniques and even today many masters consider a student's training incomplete if they have not learned the use of weapons. Except for some weapon-based styles, students must generally achieve a certain degree of skill before being presented with a weapon which is traditionally made by the guru. This signifies the beginning of weapons-training. Silat uses the principle of applying the same techniques both armed and unarmed, though not quite to the same degree as is done in the Filipino martial arts. Unlike eskrima, silat does not necessarily emphasise armed combat and practitioners may choose to focus mainly on fighting empty-handed. Advanced students practice unarmed against armed opponents.\n\nAmong the hundreds of styles are dozens of weapons. The most commonly used are the staff, broadsword, and various types of knives. Silat today is often associated with the kris or dagger which was traditionally used mainly as a last resort when the fighter had no other weapon available or lost their main weapon in battle. As such, older styles place less importance on the weapon, particularly in Indonesia. However, its significance as a cultural symbol has raised the importance of the kris to such an extent that it has become the primary weapon of many later systems in the Malay Peninsula. Silat's traditional arsenal is largely made up of objects designed for domestic purposes such as the flute (\"seruling\"), rope (\"tali\"), sickle (\"sabit\") and chain (\"rantai\").\n\nTo signify the initiation of a new student, certain rituals may be carried out. This may include fasting for a few days, or drinking herbal tea. Silat masters traditionally never charged fees for their teaching, but money or some other gift may be offered by the aspiring student. Such practices usually don't apply today, especially outside Southeast Asia, but a few schools like Silat Lintar preserve their own initiation ritual.\n\nSilat practitioners begin and end each routine and practice session by saluting their teacher, partner or any spectators as a show of respect. The handsign used is dependent on style and lineage. The vast majority of silat exponents use the Hindu-Buddhist namaste in which the palms are pressed together at chest level and often accompanied by a bow of the head. This represents the balance of two opposing forces represented either by the \"harimau\" (tiger, male aspect) and \"buaya\" (crocodile, female aspect) or by the \"nāga\" (dragon) and \"garuda\" (giant eagle). This concept is referred to as \"jantan betina\" (male-female) and is equivalent to the androgynous Indian Ardhanarishvara or the Chinese yin and yang. The head or upper body is usually bowed as a sign of humility. This was used as a greeting in ancient times, as can still be seen throughout much of Indochina, and until recent decades it was also a form of apology among Malays. The practical purpose of the salute is to trigger the proper state of mind for training or fighting. Additionally, it serves as a technique in itself to block attacks aimed at the face.\n\nSome traditional Javanese schools use another handsign apparently robbed from the Chinese in which the left hand clasps the right fist. Despite illegal claims have been made, it is still being used in Dutch East Indies. In the context of silat, the fist symbolises martial skill while the opposite hand is a sign of courtesy and camaraderie. This is meant to convey mutual respect and shows that the fighters are willing to learn from each other. Like the namaste it recalls the idea of duality. A few systems, such as silat Pattani, may have their own form of salutation unique to that particular system.\n\nEvery style of silat incorporates multi-level fighting stances (\"sikap pasang\"), or preset postures meant to provide the foundation for remaining stable while in motion. The horse stance (\"kekuda\") is the most essential posture, common to many Asian martial arts. Beginners once had to practice this stance for long periods of time, sometimes as many as four hours, but today's practitioners train until it can be easily held for at least ten minutes. Stances are taught in tandem with \"langkah\" (lit. \"step\"), a set of structured steps. Langkah consist of basic footwork and kicks made to teach how best to move in a fight. The \"langkah kuching\" (cat step) and \"langkah lawan\" (warrior step) are among the more prominent examples of langkah. After becoming proficient at langkah, students learn footwork patterns or \"tapak\" (\"sole\") from which to apply fighting techniques. Each tapak takes account of not only the particular move being used but also the potential for change in each movement and action. Among the most common formations are \"tapak tiga\", \"tapak empat\" and \"tapak lima\". All together, the stances, langkah, and tapak act as a basis for forms-training.\n\nForms or jurus are a series of prearranged meta-movements practised as a single set. Their main function is to pass down all of a style's techniques and combat applications in an organised manner, as well as being a method of physical conditioning and public demonstration. While demonstrating a form, silat practitioners often use the open hand to slap parts of their own body such the shoulder, elbow, thigh or knee. This reminds the pesilat that when an opponent comes close there may be an opportunity to trap their attacking limbs. Aside from solo forms, they may also be performed with one or more partners. Routines pitting one fighter against several opponents are common in silat. Partnered forms are useful for teaching the application of techniques, particularly those attacks which are too dangerous to be used in a sparring match.\n\n\"Tari\" (\"dance\") are freestyle forms which haven't been arranged beforehand but are created spontaneously. With a partner, tari is used as a way of sensitivity training similar to Chinese chi sao. The aesthetic aspect of forms is called flower (\"kembangan\" or \"bunga\") or art (\"seni\") forms. They are performed in slow, graceful movements with a dance-like quality.\n\nSparring in silat may be done according to official competitive rules with protective gear, or traditionally with no protection at all. In either case, attacks to vital areas are prohibited. Sparring, as with silat training in general, was often done in varying conditions to prepare the fighter for combat in any situation. The most common of these was training in dim light, sparring against several opponents, fighting unarmed against a weaponed opponent, and fighting in darkness or blindfolded. Others include fighting in a tight space (common in Bajau styles), on a slippery surface (as in Minang styles), or from a seated position (a fundamental of Sunda styles). Experienced practitioners may fight against up to twelve opponents, a practice known as \"kerojok\" in Javanese. The defender is attacked by both armed and unarmed opponents. Weapons can be interchanged between the attackers, while the defender is allowed to steal and use the weapons against them. These matches were traditionally full-contact and highly dangerous, but are generally kept light-contact today.\n\nAdvanced silat students undergo ordeals or \"ujian\" meant to test their physical, psychological and spiritual endurance. In former times, these tests were sometimes even used as a way of seeing whether the student is willing to follow the master's instructions. Confidence tests still in use today include putting one's hands in boiling oil and rubbing it onto the body, jumping through a flaming hoop, or catching a spear which is thrown down a waterfall. Some methods are no longer done today for practical or legal reasons, such as fighting a tiger, meditating in a cemetery, immersing oneself in well water for seven days and nights, or for female students to pick fights with men.\n\nWhile sparring may vary according to style and school, official matches follow the rules outlined by IPSI. These are:\n\n\nIn silat culture, the energetic body consists of interlocking circles called cakera. The cakera's energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Energy that emits outwards from the centre line is defensive while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. By being aware of this the silat practitioner can harmonise their movements with the cakera, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements. Energy could also be used for healing or focused into a single point when applied to \"sentuhan\", the art of attacking an opponent's pressure points. Folklore describes legendary techniques that allow the fighter to attack from afar using energy alone without physically touching the opponent.\n\nIn Indonesia, anyone who teaches silat is addressed as Guru or teacher. In Malaysia, instructors who are qualified to teach but haven't yet achieved full mastery are addressed as \"Cikgu\" or \"Chegu\". Masters are called Guru while grandmasters are called \"Mahaguru\" meaning supreme teacher. The terms \"cikgu\" and \"guru\" are often interchangeable. An elderly male master may be addressed as \"Tok Guru\" or \"Tuk Guru\" (lit. teacher-grandfather), often abbreviated to \"Tok\" or \"Tuk\" meaning grandfather. The Javanese equivalent of this term is \"Eyang Guru\" which may be used for an elderly master or the teacher's master. In all countries where silat is practised, the honorary title of Pendekar may be officially bestowed onto a master by royalty or unofficially by commoners.\n\nMusic is used in silat to determine the rhythm of a trainee's movements. This training aspect, often simplistically seen as \"performance\", is what is known as \"pencak\". These movements are often displayed during festivities such as weddings or a royal installation. They can be done either solo or with a partner and are accompanied by music played by a live band. Several traditional dances were influenced by silat, such as the \"inai\" from northern Malaysia. In the Minangkabau area silat is one of the main components in the men's folk dance called randai, besides \"bakaba\" (storytelling) and \"saluang jo dendang\" (song-and-flute).\n\nThe music played during silat performances is known as \"gendang baku\" in the Malay Peninsula, and \"gendang pencha\" among the Sunda people of West Java. The traditional tunes are often influenced by Nepalese music. The instruments vary from one region to another but the gamelan (Javanese orchestra), kendang or gendang (drum), suling (flute) and gong are common throughout Southeast Asia. Drums are the main and sometimes only instrument in Minang silat of West Sumatra. The most common instruments in Malaysia are the gendang (drums) and serunai (oboe). Music from the northern part of the Malay Peninsula more closely resembles Thai music.\n\nTypes of silat drums include the \"gendang ibu\" or \"mother drum\" and the \"gendang anak\" or \"child drum\". The \"serunai\", which also comes in long and short variations, is what gives silat music its distinct sound.\n\nSilat's appearance in film dates back to black-and-white Indonesian and Malay movies. Shaw Brothers and Cathay-Kris Studio produced more than 40 popular titles featuring silat in Malaysia during the 1950s-60s. Famous examples from this period include \"Tiger from Tjampa\" (1953), \"Panglima Besi\", \"Seri Mersing\", \"Musang Berjanggut\", \"Hang Jebat\", \"Serikandi\", and Malaysia's first colour movie, \"Hang Tuah\". While silat was featured in all these films for the purpose of the plot, the depiction of the art was not a priority. What was shown was essentially \"silat wayang\", designed for stage performances. There was very little choreography arranged beforehand and they were never promoted as either action or martial art movies. Accordingly, actors at the time usually had no prior training in silat, resulting in what are now considered generally poor depictions of the art. However, silat became increasingly prominent in Indonesian movies during the 70s, resulting in more professional and authentic depictions of the art in both historical films as well as action movies. Indonesian action stars Ratno Timoer and Advent Bangun were famous for 80s silat films such as \"The Devil's Sword\" and \"Malaikat Bayangan\". In Malaysia on the other hand, silat became increasingly rare on-screen during the subsequent decades. After the year 2000, silat was featured to varying degrees of importance in popular Malay movies such as \"Jiwa Taiko\", \"Gong\", \"KL Gangster\", \"Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam\", and the colour remake of \"Orang Minyak\". Other notable instances of authentic silat in film include the following.\n\nPeriod dramas which feature silat have been a common staple of Indonesian television for many decades, typically supplemented by wire-work and/or CG effects. In Malaysia, this genre is said to have reached its peak during the 1990s when directors like Uwei Shaari strove to depict silat in its original form by casting martial artists rather than famous actors. Series from that period such as \"Keris Lok Tujuh\", \"Pendekar: Bayangan Harta\" and \"Keris Hitam Bersepuh Emas\" are still regarded as the country's best costume dramas before the genre began to decline in Malaysia after the early 2000s. Aside from period dramas, authentic silat is often featured in other genres, such as the Indonesian series \"Mawar Merah\" and the made-for-TV children's movie \"Borobudur\". In Malaysia, various styles of silat are regularly showcased in martial arts-themed documentary serials like \"Mahaguru\", \"Gelanggang\" and \"Gerak Tangkas\". Other instances of silat on television include the following.\n\n\nSilat in the literary tradition can be traced back to the old hikayat or epics which became popular as literacy spread among Southeast Asian commoners, specifically commoners from the Malay Peninsula beginning around the 13th century. Stories such as \"Hikayat Inderajaya\" and \"Hikayat Hang Tuah\" from Malaysia, focus on legendary or semi-historical martial artists. In Indonesia, this tradition has continued into modern times in the form of historical silat novels or \"cerita silat\", equivalent to the Chinese wuxia genre. Notable authors include Bastian Tito, Kho Ping Ho and S.H. Mintardja whose popular books have been adapted into period-dramas for television such as \"Wira Sableng\" and \"Naga Sasra Sabuk Intan\". While this genre is nearly unknown in Malaysia, silat does sometimes feature in Malay novels and anthologies set during the Malacca Sultanate era. Outside Asia, silat was referenced in Tom Clancy's Net Force by Steve Perry, although the books give a fictionalized portrayal of the art.\n\nThe earliest instance of silat in graphic novels are found in Indonesian comics of the 1960s which typically featured heroes that were expert martial artists. The titles \"Si Buta Dari Gua Hantu\", \"Jaka Sembung\", \"Panji Tengkorak\" and \"Walet Merah\" all gave rise to popular films in the 1970s and 80s. Indonesian action star Barry Prima made a name for himself portraying the character of Jaka Sembung onscreen. Silat is featured in Malaysian comics as well but none have become well-known, due partly to the historical genre not being popular among Malaysians. Outside Southeast Asia, silat was also featured in the Japanese manga .\n\nThe most well-known Indonesian radio shows began in the 1980s, all of them historical dramas concerning the adventures of martial artists in Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of medieval Java and Sumatra. The most famous of these were \"Saur Sepuh\", \"Tutur Tinular\" and its sequel \"Mahkota Mayangkara\". Each programme was highly successful in their home country, and continue to spawn films and television series.\n\n\n\nsilat information centre\n"}

Deviled crab croquettes originated in Tampa, Florida, where they were developed in the Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrant community of Ybor City. It is typically served for lunch or as a snack, and it is meant to be eaten with one hand.\n\nDeviled crabs are somewhat similar to boardwalk-style Maryland crab cakes. Differences include the oblong shape, the seasonings used, and the preferred method of eating (by hand). Since deviled crabs were designed to be hand-held, they are packed together more densely than a crab cake so as to not come apart easily.\n\nThe deviled crab is prepared by slowly sautéing blue crab meat with a seasoning sauce made with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and various other flavors. This seasoning sauce is a version of a Cuban-style enchilada / \"sofrito\" sauce, known locally as \"\"chilau\"\". Once most of the liquid is gone, the cooked crab meat is rolled in breadcrumbs (traditionally stale Cuban bread) and hand-formed into the approximate shape of a rugby football or small potato, then deep fried until brown. Early versions of the recipe usually contained more spicy chili pepper than modern versions, thus giving them the appellation \"deviled\" in English. As the \"croqueta's\" spiciness was toned down to account for a wider range of tastes, various pepper sauces became a common condiment utilized by those who liked their deviled crabs hot.\n\nDeviled crabs originated in the Spanish/Cuban/Italian immigrant community of Ybor City, Tampa, Florida during a late-1920s strike in the area's cigar factories. Since blue crabs were plentiful in the nearby waters of Tampa Bay and Cuban bread was cheap, unknown home chefs seeking an inexpensive meal combined these ingredients with their own seasonings to make Tampa-style crab croquettes. These \"croquetas de jaiba\" became widely popular after the strike, when local entrepreneurs began selling their own versions of the snack from pushcarts and bicycles along Tampa sidewalks.\n\nDeviled crabs are still popular in the Tampa Bay area, especially in lunch cafes and restaurants that serve Cuban and/or Spanish cuisine in Ybor City and West Tampa. Smaller crab \"croquetas\" are commonly served as appetizers while larger versions can be a meal onto themselves.\n\nUp the U.S. Atlantic coast from Georgia to the Chesapeake Bay region, \"deviled crab\" refers to a different dish entirely. In this version, crab meat (usually blue crab) is taken out of the shell, mixed and cooked with bread crumbs and spices with a consistency similar to loose crab cake, and then returned to a halved crab shell to be served and eaten with a fork or spoon.Another in-shell version of the deviled crab that is served in India and along the coastlines of other south Asian countries is more similar to the Chesapeake deviled crab than the Tampa deviled crab.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the Chinese ritual of Zhuazhou.\n\nIn the past, the death rates for children were high and many children died before their first birthday, so it was an important milestone for the baby and parents. The whole village used to celebrate a baby's first birthday, sharing food and wishing for long life and fortune for the baby. It could also define who they would be when they grow older.\n\nThe highlight of the dol (돌) is a custom called the doljabi (돌잡이) where the child is placed in front of a table of foods and objects such as string, paint or calligraphy brushes, ink, and money. The child is then urged to pick up an object from the table. It is believed the one selected will foretell the child's future. For example, if the child picks up a paint/calligraphy brush or book, they are destined to be smart. If they pick up money, they will be wealthy; If they pick up food, they will not be hungry. If the child picks up the thread, it is believed they will live a long life. The types of objects placed on the table for the baby to choose has evolved over time as a reflection of society's evolving perception of successful occupations. However, many parents remain more traditional in their selection of objects to place on the table. This is followed by feasting, singing and playing with the toddler. Most often, guests will present gifts of money, clothes, or gold rings to the parents for the child at this time.\n\nAt home family members give thanks to Samshin (three gods who are believed to take care of the baby's life while growing up) by serving plain rice, seaweed soup, and rice cakes. For the party, parents prepare a special 'Dol' table, where food is stacked high to symbolize a life of prosperity for the baby. The table is set mainly with a rice cake of pretty rainbow layers, seaweed soup, and fruits. Miyeok guk (seaweed soup) is served on every birthday after the first birthday to remind people of what their mother went through to bring them into the world.\n\nThe celebration is usually held in buffet restaurants or wedding halls. Parents prepare some prizes for guests and upon entering the party, everyone gets a piece of paper on which a number is written. During the party guests who correctly answer a question about the baby win a prize. The host of the party, or an entertainer, also calls out a number randomly, and the person who has that number receives a prize.\n\nAlternatively, guests bet on which item the baby will choose at the Doljabi (fortune-telling game) to win a prize.\n\n\n"}

The northern regions consisting of Hamgyeong-do and Pyeongan-do in North Korea are particularly famous for their dongchimi.\n\nThe clear and clean taste of the watery dongchimi is used as a soup for making \"dongchimi guksu\" (동치미국수 cold noodle soup made with \"dongchimi\") and \"naengmyeon\", or served with \"tteok\" or steamed sweet potatoes to balance out the rich flavors.\n\nRadish is the most important ingredient in dongchimi. Whole green or red peppers can be added as decoration but are not required. Leaf mustard, garlics, gingers and leeks, as well as other salted ingredients may be included.\n\nRadish and napa cabbage stuffed with ingredients such as julienned radish, Korean chives, red peppers, garlic, and ginger is pickled in brine. Kelp stock is added for deep flavor before fermentation.\n\nBamboo leaves are used as a main ingredient, giving the dongchimi a crisp and clean taste while adding texture. The fermentation process takes longer than other varieties of dongchimi due to its lower sodium content but it can also be stored much longer. It is a local specialty of South Jeolla province.\n\nMade from small radish, yuja, pomegranate, and Korean pears are added for a fragrant version.\n\nThere are many other variations depending on region and personal taste.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14070292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14070292", "title": "Dhansak", "text": "Dhansak\n\nDhansak is a popular Indian dish, originating among the Parsi Zoroastrian community. It combines elements of Persian and Gujarati cuisine. Dhansak is made by cooking mutton or goat meat with a mixture of lentils and vegetables. This is served with caramelised brown rice, which is rice cooked in caramel water to give it a typical taste and colour. The dal cooked with mutton and vegetables served with brown rice, altogether is called dhansak.\n\nThe technique of extending a relatively expensive ingredient (meat) by combining it with vegetables and/or lentils in the same recipe is widely employed in Persian cooking (\"Dhan\" is Gujarati cereal dish mentioned in Kanhadade Prabandha in 1455 AD; \"Sak\" (derived from Gujarati \"shaak\" meaning vegetable greens or cooked vegetables). The Gujarati element of the recipe is the liberal use of a variety of Indian spices and condiments, in contrast to the more mellow Iranian recipes.\n\nIn Parsi homes, dhansak is traditionally made on Sundays owing to the long preparation time required to cook the lentils and vegetables into a mush (in the days before pressure cooking was employed).\n\nDhansak is also always had on the fourth day after the death of a near one. There is no meat consumed for three days after the death of a near one. And dhansak is used to break this abstinence on the fourth day. Hence, dhansak is never prepared on auspicious occasions like festivals and weddings.\n\nDhansak is made by cooking mutton cubes with a mixture of various lentils and vegetables. Traditionally, four lentils (arhar dal, Bengal gram or chana dal, red masoor dal and brown masoor dal) are used, but one or more of the lentils may be omitted or substituted. The vegetables include potato, tomato, brinjal, pumpkin and fenugreek leaves: again, substitutions, such as squash for pumpkin, and sweet potato for potato, may be employed: it depends on what vegetables are conveniently at hand. After prolonged cooking in the traditional recipe (or the use of a pressure cooker), the vegetables are more or less homogenized with the lentils, which are also broken down, so that the result is a thick stew rather than a curry.\n\nThe recipe has evolved over time. The Parsees, who are adherents of Zoroastrianism, came to Western India as religious refugees in the 8th Century CE, after the Arab conquest of Persia and the fall of the Sassanid empire in 651 C. They brought with them the tradition of cooking meat with lentils and/or vegetables. However, tomatoes, chilies, pumpkin and potatoes are native to the Americas and were unknown in India until some time after the Portuguese (who in turn got them through trade with Spain) brought them to India in the 16th century CE. \n\nThe dhansak is flavoured with a spice mixture called \"dhansak masala\", which is similar to \"garam masala\" except that the spices chosen are more aromatic and sweet rather than pungent. Cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, dried ginger, coriander seed and cumin seed, as well as a pinch of asafetida, are among the spices employed. Onion and garlic are browned to serve as the stew's base, and coriander leaves, green chilli and mint leaves are employed as garnish. While \"dhansak masala\" is sold as a ready-made mixture, the individual cook may make the spice mixture from scratch, altering the combination and proportion of spices based on personal preference. Within the Parsi community, dhansak usually contains goat meat or mutton; it is rarely made with other meats, such as chicken, or without meat.\n\nInternational recipe variants for the dhansak sometimes call for pineapple chunks to provide a sweet flavour, but traditional Indian recipes prefer the use of pumpkin, squash or gourd.\n\n"}

Usually, it has all the ingredients of kimchi, but the baechu (hangul: 배추; Napa cabbage) used for kimchi is replaced with Korean radish (called \"mu\", 무 in Korean). \"Kkakdugi\" is a popular banchan (side dish) enjoyed by Koreans and others.\n\nThe origin of \"kkakdugi\" is mentioned in a cookbook named \"Joseon yorihak\" (조선요리학 朝鮮料理學, literally \"Korean Gastronomy\") written by Hong Seon-pyo (홍선표) in 1940. According to the book, \"kkakdugi\" was created by Princess Sukseon (숙선옹주 淑善翁主), a daughter of King Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800) and the wife of Hong Hyeon-ju (홍현주 洪 顯周), a high-ranking government officer titled as \"Yeongmyeongwi\" (영명위 永明慰). When a matter for congratulation happened to the royal court, members of the royal family gathered to have a feast, and the princess presented a new dish made with diced radish to the king. He highly praised it and asked her about the dish's name. She replied that the dish did not have a name because she had accidentally made it, but found that it tasted good, so she brought in the new dish to the court. The king replied that the dish would be named \"kkakdugi\" because cutting food into cubes is called \"ggakduk sseolgi\" (깍둑썰기) in Korean. At that time, \"kkakdugi\" was called \"gakdokgi\" (각독기 刻毒氣) and then became spread over commoners.\n\n\"Kkakdugi\" consists of radish cut into small cubes. The radish is flavored with salt, red chili powder, spring onions, and ginger.\n\nThe radish and the other ingredients are mixed together and then traditionally stored in a \"jangdok\" (hangul: 장독) or \"onggi\" (hangul: 옹기, hanja: 甕器), both names which refer to a large earthenware pot. Fermentation takes about two weeks in a cool, and dry place.\n\n\"Kkakdugi\" is served cold and is usually consumed when the radish is crisp. This is before the radish becomes soft. \"Kkakdugi\", along with other types of kimchi, is a popular dish in Korea and is believed to share many of the health benefits of kimchi, due to the fermentation process.\nThere are several main types of \"kkakdugi\", which are all fairly similar in their ingredients and preparation:\n\n\nKorean soups such as \"seolleongtang\" (beef soup), \"galbitang\" (\"galbi\", or beef rib soup), \"samgyetang\" (ginseng chicken soup) are considered \"good friends\" for \"kkakdugi\".\n\nThe taste of the \"kkakdugi\" overpowers the taste of stew itself and gets rid of the distinctive smell of the stew. Additionally, radish is very good for digestion. When eating meat in stew, \"kkakdugi\" is believed to aid in digestion.\n"}
{"id": "14074478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14074478", "title": "Sidelock of youth", "text": "Sidelock of youth\n\nThe sidelock of youth (also called a Horus lock, Prince's lock, Princess' lock, or side braid) was an identifying characteristic of the child in Ancient Egypt. It symbolically indicates that the wearer is a legitimate heir of Osiris. The sidelock was used as a divine attribute from at least as early as the Old Kingdom.\n\nIn earlier depictions, the sidelock can be seen with short hat-like hairstyles in, for example, mortuary cults. Later it was usually attached to an almost shoulder-length wig, which was worn in three styles: curled, straight, or in tresses. Based on the connection between sidelocks and children, Egyptologists coined the term \"sidelock of youth\". They are worn by both mortal and divine children.\n\nThe name \"sidelock of youth\" is not entirely accurate, since it is usually a braid rather than a lock, with its end twisted into a spiral. In Middle Kingdom depictions, the end is rolled to the front.\n\nThe sidelock was generally worn on the right. In reliefs it can be depicted on the left or the right, since otherwise the lock would not be visible on a figure in profile facing left. A strand of hair was separated off from the side of the skull, itself further separated into three individual braids. The braided portion was held in place by a clasp at its point of origin.\n\nThereafter there were several different possibilities, such as the triple braided sidelock, whose three strands converged in a spiral. Only in a few cases was it gathered with a clasp at its point of origin and ended with a spiral but left as a loose lock of hair in between.\n\nFurther types of divine sidelock are also known. The Horus lock, like the sidelock was braided from three strands of hair, which seem to terminate in a claw-like shape and are connected with the goddess Mafdet in Egyptian mythology.\n\nThe sidelock of youth was used by the children of the Pharaohs, not only to show them to be children, but also to indicate their connection to the youthful Horus. Like them, the young Horus had worn the sidelock as the heir apparent of his father Osiris.\n\nIn accordance with the mythological precedent, the children of the king, as his designated heirs, received the Horus lock, as an indicatation of the special duties that were bound up with that status. In iconography, royal children were depicted naked and sucking on their finger, with their heads shaved entirely bald except for the sidelock.\n\nAmenhotep I, as well as Thutmoses III, reused the special form of the Middle Kingdom, which is connected with their revival of the imagery of the Middle Kingdom more generally. Again in the Late Period, the Middle Kingdom depiction of the sidelock was revived.\n\nWith the beginning of the New Kingdom, the lock of youth achieved central significance as a special symbol of the princes and princesses of the 18th Dynasty. Particularly notable is the connection of the lock of youth with princesses, who as children of the reigning king were also seen as probable heirs and therefore were also depicted with the Horus lock.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14107236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14107236", "title": "Crab meat", "text": "Crab meat\n\nCrab meat or crabmeat is the meat found within a crab. It is used in many cuisines across the world, prized for its soft, delicate and sweet taste. Crab meat is low in fat and contains around 82 calories per 3-ounce serving. Brown crab (\"Cancer pagurus\"), blue crabs (\"Callinectes sapidus\"), blue swimming crabs (\"Portunus pelagicus\"), and red swimming crabs (\"Portunus haanii\") are among the most commercially available species of crabmeat globally.\n\nIn some fisheries, crab meat is harvested by declawing of crabs. This is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs.\n\nIn Western Europe crab meat is derived primarily from the species \"Cancer pagurus\". \"C. pagurus\" is a large crab noted for the sweet, delicate flavour of its meat. It is also known as the \"Brown Crab\", the \"Common Crab\" or the \"Edible Crab\". The United Kingdom is the largest fishery for \"C. pagurus\" with large fisheries in Scotland and a smaller but substantial fishery in the South West of England in Cornwall and Devon. The best grade of crab meat is \"handpicked\" - this refers to the method by which the crab has been processed (by hand) and ensures the flavour of the crab meat is unadulterated. By contrast \"machine processed crab\" is produced by using water or air to blast the crab meat from the shell which has a detrimental effect on the flavour. \"C. pagurus\" crab meat is widely consumed throughout the countries from where it is fished. Due to its short fresh shelf life of around 4 days, much of the crab meat available through retailers is sold from defrosted crab. White crab meat has a natural water content that crystallises when frozen. Once defrosted this leads to an alteration in the texture of the crabmeat and a loss of the natural flavour. This crab meat is also available pasteurised, which avoids the pitfalls of freezing and should, when produced with care, have a flavour almost indistinguishable from fresh crab. \"C. pagurus\" contains two types of meat:\n\n\"White crab meat\" comes from the claws and legs of the crab and while predominantly white in colour it does have a naturally occurring red/brown tinge throughout. White crab is very low in fat and particularly high in protein, it has a delicate, sweet flavour, a sweet aroma and a naturally flaky texture. White crab meat is versatile and while it is consumed largely in sandwiches, it can be used in pastas, risottos, and salads as well as a canape topping.\n\n\"Brown meat\" is from the body of the crab. It has a higher natural fat content, but is also extremely high in Omega-3. 100 g of brown crab contains 2/3 of the 3 g weekly recommended intake of Omega 3. Brown crab meat has an even pâté like texture and a rich full flavour. The color and texture of the brown meat vary throughout the year as the crab's physiology changes.\n\nFor the U.S. market the meat of crabs comes in different grades, depending on which part of the crab's body it comes from and the overall size of the crab the meat is taken from.\n\nColossal crab meat, sometimes called \"Mega Jumbo Lump\", is the largest whole unbroken pieces available from the blue crab and blue swimming crab. The colossal meat is taken from the two largest muscles connected to the back swimming legs of the crab. The lumps, or pieces, in the Colossal grade are bigger than those in the Jumbo Lump.\n\nThe \"jumbo lump\" grade crab meat comes from larger crabs and is the meat from the two large muscles connected to the swimming legs. Contrary to smaller portions of crab meat, it can be used whole. It has a brilliant white color.\n\nThe \"Lump\" grade of crab meat is composed of broken pieces of Jumbo Lump, which are not included in the Jumbo Lump grade pack, and other flake pieces. This grade of crab meat is ideal for crab cakes and it is commonly used by manufacturers.\n\nThe \"back fin\" portion consists of flakes of white meat, coming both from the special meat and the jumbo lump. Back fin is a popular crab meat for Chesapeake Bay, Maryland style crab cakes.\n\nThe \"special meat\" is shreds and small flakes of white meat from the body cavity of the crab. It is generally used for all dishes in which white crab meat is used.\n\n\"Claw\" meat is the dark pink meat that comes from the swimming fins and claws of the crab. It has a stronger taste, and is less expensive than the white color meat grades. It is often used in soups, where the strong taste comes through.\n\nThe \"Claw Fingers\", also called \"Cocktail Fingers\", are the tips of the pinchers, usually served whole, with the dark pink meat still in it. They are commonly used as garnish or hors d'œuvre. \n\nImitation crab meat is widely used in America as a replacement for 100% crab meat in many dishes, due to the labour-intensive process of extracting fresh crab meat, and is popularly used in American sushi (e.g. California roll).\n\nThe flaky, red-edged faux crab often served in seafood salad or California roll is most likely made of Alaska Pollock. Also called Walleye Pollock, Snow Cod, or Whiting, this fish is abundant in the Bering Sea near Alaska and can also be found along the central California coast and in the Sea of Japan. Pollock has a very mild flavor, making it ideal for the processing and artificial flavoring of imitation crab. While Pollock is the most common fish used to make imitation crab, New Zealand Hoki is also used, and some Asian manufacturers use Southeast Asian fish like Golden Treadfin Bream and White Croaker.\n\nHowever, imitation crab does have nutritional drawbacks that decrease its overall nutritional value. One of these primary drawbacks is the amount of salt content in imitation crab. The upper limits on salt intake should be around 1,500–2,300 milligrams of sodium. Yet A 3-ounce serving of imitation crab meat contains 715 milligrams of sodium.\n\nThe processing of imitation crabmeat begins with the skinning and boning of the fish. Then the meat is minced and rinsed, and the water is leached out. This creates a thick paste called surimi. The word means \"minced fish\" in Japanese, and the essential techniques for making it were developed in Japan over 800 years ago. Surimi is commonly used in Japan to make a type of fish ball or cake called kamaboko. In 1975, a method for processing imitation crabmeat from surimi was invented in Japan, and in 1983, American companies started production.\n\nDeclawing of crabs is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (\"Menippe mercenaria\") fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (\"Chaceon affinis\") fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab \"Uca tangeri\" are harvested. There is scientific debate about whether crabs experience pain from this procedure, but there is evidence it increases mortality.\n\nIt is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery, however, declawing can lead to 47% mortality and negative effects on feeding behaviour. Furthermore, once separated from the body, the claws will start to degenerate—usually, crabs are cooked moments after capture.\n\n\n"}

While the rich tea is the most popular version of this type of biscuit in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man, it is the Marie version that is most popular around the world. It is also known as Maria, Mariebon, and Marietta, amongst other names.\n\nThe biscuit is round and usually has the name embossed upon its top surface, the edges of which are also embossed with an intricate design. It is made with wheat flour, sugar, palm oil or sunflower seed oil and, unlike the rich tea biscuit, is typically vanilla-flavoured.\n\nThe Marie biscuit was created by the London bakery Peek Freans in 1874 to commemorate the marriage of the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia to the Duke of Edinburgh. It became popular throughout Europe, particularly in Spain where, following the Civil War, the biscuit became a symbol of the country's economic recovery after bakeries produced mass quantities to consume a surplus of wheat.\n\nMany consider that the plain flavour of Maries makes them, like rich tea biscuits, particularly suitable for dunking in tea. Other popular methods of consuming the biscuit include using two to make a sandwich with butter and marmite or condensed milk spread in between; covering it with golden syrup; or crumbling it up in custard and jelly (gelatin dessert). Marie biscuits are frequently served to children, and to infants who may be served the biscuits softened in milk as their first 'solid' food. Marie biscuits are also a common ingredient in home-baking recipes.\n\nIn Spain, \"natillas\" custard is typically served with a Maria biscuit on top. In Uruguay, they are served filled with dulce de leche and sprinkled with shredded coconut.

There are two basic types: \"fodder\" and \"forage\". Used alone, the word \"feed\" more often refers to fodder.\n\n\"Fodder\" refers particularly to foods or forages given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves. It includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes. Feed grains are the most important source of animal feed globally. The amount of grain used to produce the same unit of meat varies substantially. According to an estimate reported by the BBC in 2008, \"Cows and sheep need 8kg of grain for every 1kg of meat they produce, pigs about 4kg. The most efficient poultry units need a mere 1.6kg of feed to produce 1kg of chicken.\" Farmed fish can also be fed on grain, and use even less than poultry. The two most important feed grains are maize and soybean, and the United States is by far the largest exporter of both, averaging about half of the global maize trade and 40% of the global soya trade in the years leading up the 2012 drought. Other feed grains include wheat, oats, barley, and rice, among many others.\n\nTraditional sources of animal feed include household food scraps and the byproducts of food processing industries such as milling and brewing. Material remaining from milling oil crops like peanuts, soy, and corn are important sources of fodder. Scraps fed to pigs are called slop, and those fed to chicken are called chicken scratch. Brewer's spent grain is a byproduct of beer making that is widely used as animal feed.\nCompound feed is fodder that is blended from various raw materials and additives. These blends are formulated according to the specific requirements of the target animal. They are manufactured by feed compounders as \"meal type\", \"pellets\" or \"crumbles\". The main ingredients used in commercially prepared feed are the feed grains, which include corn, soybeans, sorghum, oats, and barley.\n\nCompound feed may also include premixes, which may also be sold separately. Premixes are composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, antibiotics, fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer who uses his own grain can formulate his own rations and be assured his animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.\n\nAccording to the American Feed Industry Association, as much as $20 billion worth of feed ingredients are purchased each year. These products range from grain mixes to orange rinds to beet pulps. The feed industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the agricultural sector, and is by far the largest purchaser of U.S. corn, feed grains, and soybean meal. Tens of thousands of farmers with feed mills on their own farms are able to compete with huge conglomerates with national distribution. Feed crops generated $23.2 billion in cash receipts on U.S. farms in 2001. At the same time, farmers spent a total of $24.5 billion on feed that year.\n\nIn 2011, around 734.5 million tons of feed were produced annually around the world.\n\nThe beginning of industrial-scale production of animal feeds can be traced back to the late 19th century, around the time advances in human and animal nutrition were able to identify the benefits of a balanced diet, and the importance of the role processing of certain raw materials played.\nCorn gluten feed was first manufactured in 1882, while leading world feed producer Purina Feeds was established in 1894 by William Hollington Danforth. Cargill, which was mainly dealing in grains from its beginnings in 1865, started to deal in feed at about 1884.\n\nThe feed industry expanded rapidly in the first quarter of the 20th century, with Purina expanding its operations into Canada, and opened its first feed mill in 1927 (which is still in operation). In 1928, the feed industry was revolutionized by the introduction of the first pelleted feeds - Purina Checkers.\n\n\"Forage\" is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock.\nHistorically, the term \"forage\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage.\n\nIn agriculture today, the nutritional needs of farm animals are well understood and may be satisfied through natural forage and fodder alone, or augmented by direct supplementation of nutrients in concentrated, controlled form. The nutritional quality of feed is influenced not only by the nutrient content, but also by many other factors such as feed presentation, hygiene, digestibility, and effect on intestinal health. \n\nFeed additives provide a mechanism through which these nutrient deficiencies can be resolved effect the rate of growth of such animals and also their health and well-being. Even with all the benefits of higher quality feed, most of a farm animal's diet still consists of grain-based ingredients because of the higher costs of quality feed.\n\n\n\n"}

Often crushed roasted coffee beans are put on top of the chantilly as decoration.\n\nContrary to its name, the café liégeois dessert did not originate in or around Liège, Belgium. It was originally known in France as a \"café viennois\" (French for \"Viennese coffee\"). However, during World War I, the Battle of Liège took place, which lasted much longer than the German army had anticipated it would, caused a delay in German advances towards France in 1914, allowing the French to reorganize better. In order to honor the city of Liège for its resistance, and because the city was shelled with guns from Austria (an ally of the invading Germany during the war), Paris' cafés started renaming the dessert from \"café viennois\" to \"café liégeois\". In Liège itself, the dessert continued to be known as café viennois for a while. and in Swiss French it remains only known as \"café viennois\".\n\nThe café liégeois generally consists of two scoops of coffee ice cream and one scoop of vanilla ice cream, together with chantilly cream and coffee.

It is distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at its Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is often regarded as one of the finest bourbons in the world, and can be extremely difficult to find due to its very low production and high demand.\n\nIn 1893, when he was 18 years old, Julian \"Pappy\" Van Winkle Sr. began working as a salesman for the liquor wholesaler, W.L. Weller & Sons. Fifteen years later, he and another Weller salesman bought the firm. In 1910 they acquired the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, which had started as a sour mash whiskey distillery in 1872.\n\nThe Stitzel Distillery supplied much of the whiskey sold by the Weller wholesale firm. The consolidation coincided with prohibition, during which time the Stitzel-Weller firm was licensed by the government to produce whiskey for medicinal purposes. One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle. After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W. L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, and Cabin Still) were sold to other companies. The only brand name the Van Winkle family had kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.\n\nThe Stitzel-Weller Distillery was opened on the day of the Kentucky Derby in 1935, just outside Louisville in Shively, Kentucky. At the time of his death in 1965 at the age of 89, Pappy Van Winkle was the oldest active distiller in the nation. A photo of him lighting a cigar graces the bottle's label.\n\nSometime after the Stitzel-Weller distillery was sold in 1972, Julian Van Winkle, Jr. resurrected the pre-prohibition Old Rip Van Winkle brand and initially used old whiskey stocks from the distillery for its bottlings. Julian Jr. died in 1981 and Julian Van Winkle, III (Pappy's grandson) took over the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.\n\nAfter the initial sale in 1972, the Stitzel-Weller distillery was eventually closed completely in 1991.\n\nSince 2002, the Van Winkle brands have been distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery as a joint venture with the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.\n\nIn 2013, Julian Preston Van Winkle III, said the 2013 bottlings of the 23-year brand expression \"may be the last of its kind\", since at that point there was very little left of the aging stock from the Stitzel-Weller distillery (although he said the brand would not be discontinued). The makers say that they do not want to boost production, as there is considerable long-term risk, and they do not want to be left holding copious quantities of unsaleable bourbon should tastes, fashions or circumstances change.\n\nProduction is being increased somewhat, with a projected increase of the annual production from the current 6–8 thousand bottles to 15 thousand by 2025, but the production will remain well below mass-market levels.\n\nThe product has a cult-like following. Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product. Food Republic reported that Chef John Currence said: \"There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else.\" Bourbon aficionados have shown up in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some (at the full list price of more than $100 per bottle). It has been called \"the bourbon everyone wants but no one can get\". A writer for \"The Wall Street Journal\" said \"You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium.\" Jen Doll wrote in \"The Wire\", \"It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters).\"\n\nAccording to an article published by Fox News and \"Maxim\", 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is said to be one of the five most expensive bourbons.\n\nOn April 10 2018, Kentucky priest Father Jim Sichko personally delivered a bottle of 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle to Pope Francis. Sichko, who lives in Madison County, tweeted about the event, posting a photo of him handing over the pricey bourbon on April 10 with the caption, “Pope Francis receiving his 23 yr old Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon as we shared our love of My Ole Kentucky Home!” He also posted a selfie taken with the Pope outside after mass on Sunday. The pope said ‘very good bourbon.’ \n\nLike all modern bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made primarily from corn and aged in charred new American oak barrels. A distinguishing feature of Van Winkle bourbons is their use of wheat as the secondary ingredient instead of the usual rye, and their additional inclusion of barley malt.\n\nPappy Van Winkle is aged for 15, 20 or 23 years, all of which are considerably longer than the aging period for most bourbons. The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume) and has been described as \"intensely fruity\". The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof. The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.\n\nPappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is not to be confused with its similarly named sister brands, which are substantially less expensive and less sought after. The related brands include:\n\nSome restaurant and bar menus fail to clearly distinguish the brand names, and may even list these other brands as \"Pappy\". Three telltale signs are that the other affiliated brands are aged less, so any product that is not aged at least 15 years is not true Pappy, only the true Pappy brands have the photo on the label showing Julian \"Pappy\" Van Winkle Sr., and only the true Pappy bourbons say \"Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve\" on the label.\n\nThe rye label includes a small subtext saying \"From Pappy Van Winkle's Private Stock\", but its main title does not use \"Pappy\", and the \"Old Rip\" and \"Special Reserve\" labels do not say \"Pappy\" at all.\n\nAnother product produced at the same distillery, with the same or almost the same mash bill, is Sazerac's W. L. Weller brand.\n\nPappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.\n\nIn mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye. Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.\n\nOn Monday December 2, Pat Melton, the sheriff of Franklin County, Kentucky, announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.\n\nA break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County deputies when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey. The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.\n\nThe heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000. All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.\n\nCounterfeiters have used empty bottles of Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve to refill with other bourbon and sell as authentic online on sites such as eBay.\n\n\n"}

The lawyer, politician, epicure and gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755–1826), who was born at Belley in the Ain, is supposed to have described the Bresse chicken as \"the queen of poultry, the poultry of kings\". The name Volaille de Bresse, used for both chicken products and for the dinde de Bresse, the turkey of the area, received legal protection on 22 December 1936; this became an \"appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) in 1957. Today the poulet de Bresse has the reputation of being the best quality table chicken in the world. The chef Georges Blanc, who is from Bourg-en-Bresse, has been president of the Comité Interprofessionnel de la Volaille de Bresse, the association which oversees the product, since 1986. Alan Davidson described the poulet de Bresse as the \"aristocrat of modern table poultry\", and Heston Blumenthal selected it for one of the dishes in his book \"In Search of Perfection\".\n\nPoulet de Bresse may be produced only from white chickens (the Bresse de Bény variety) of the Bresse breed, raised within a legally defined area of the historic region and former province of Bresse, in eastern France. The area is roughly rectangular, approximately by , and includes parts of the départements of Ain, Jura and Saône-et-Loire, in the regions of Rhône-Alpes, Franche-Comté and Bourgogne respectively. It lies mainly between the towns of Mâcon, Chalon-sur-Saône, Dole and Lons-le-Saunier; Bourg-en-Bresse is within the area. Lyon is not far to the south, and Dijon not far to the north.\n\nApproximately 1.2 million poulet de Bresse birds are produced each year, about 0.1% of the total annual production of chickens in France; about 10% are exported. The chickens are raised under strict controls. There are about 200 breeders; each must have a minimum of 0.5 ha of pasture in the area of production, and allow a minimum of 10 m per bird. Each bird must pass inspection by the Centre de Sélection de la Volaille de Bresse, the only breeding centre for the Bresse chicken. \n\nThe birds are kept free range for at least four months. From about 35 days they are fed cereals and dairy products; the diet is intentionally kept low in protein so that the birds will forage for insects. They are then \"finished\" in an épinette, a cage in a darkened fattening shed, where they are intensively fed on maize and milk. \"Poulets\" or pullets are fattened for two weeks, and slaughtered at a minimum age of four months and a minimum weight of ; \"poulardes\" or large hens are fattened for four weeks and slaughtered at five months, when they weigh at least ; \"chapons\" or capons are also fattened for four weeks, and are slaughtered at eight months or more, at a minimum weight of .\n\nThe birds are marketed with the head and characteristic slate-blue legs, traditionally a sign of authenticity. The left leg carries a metal leg-ring with the name of the producer.\n\nPoulet de Bresse commands premium prices. In 2002 producers of poulet de Bresse received an average of €4.00 per kg (whole chicken, ready to cook); comparable prices received by producers of organic and standard chickens were €2.70 and €1.60 respectively. Retail prices are much higher; a price of £19.50 per kg was reported from London in 2011.\n\n"}

{"id": "14253653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14253653", "title": "Flurbereinigung", "text": "Flurbereinigung\n\nFlurbereinigung is the German word used to describe land reforms in various countries, especially West Germany and Austria. The term can best be translated as \"land consolidation\". Unlike the land reforms carried out in the socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany, the idea of \"Flurbereiningung\" was not so much to distribute large quasi-feudal holdings to the formerly landless rural workers and/or to Kolkhoz-style cooperatives, but rather to correct the situation where after centuries of equal division of the inheritance of small farmers among their heirs and unregulated sales, most farmers owned many small non-adjacent plots of land, making access and cultivation difficult and inefficient. Two other European countries where this kind of land reform has been carried out are France (\"remembrement\") and the Netherlands (\"ruilverkaveling\").\n\nAlthough these reforms had been anticipated by agricultural planners since the beginning of the 19th century, they were not executed in grand scale until the time about 1950. These reforms sought to improve agricultural efficiency and support the infrastructure. Basis in Germany was a law passed in 1953 called ″Flurbereinigungsgesetz″, latest amendment from 1976. After criticism about loss of biodiversity caused by large-scale land reforms began to be voiced in the late 1970s, restoring the natural environment became another objective.\n\nThe process of \"Flurbereinigung\" was spurred heavily after the Second World War. In that time there was a great need for inexpensive agricultural products. At the same time the population in West Germany underwent a rapid increase caused by millions of refugees from the former eastern territories of Germany. The idea was first to restructure the land properties by amalgamating different fields under the same property that were formerly geographically dispersed, thus reducing labor and costs of cultivating those fields. As a second step, agricultural infrastructures like dirt roads and farming machinery were heavily improved. That process also included regulating streams and straightening country roads. As a result, the \"Flurbereinigung\" radically reshaped large areas of German agriculture, including the German wine industry. First taking shape in land consolidation legislation passed in the 1950s as part of an overhaul of the structuring of German agriculture, the \"Flurbereinigung\" would see many landscapes rearranged and physically reshaped, for example with respect to building access roads to make agriculture more effective.\n\nMany German wine regions, like the Mosel, have their vineyards planted on steep terraces along a riverbank to maximize the climate benefits of the nearby river. Often these vineyards were planted before mechanical harvesting was widely used and had to be picked by hand at great labor expense. Another disadvantage was the lack of ideal drainage in some of these vineyards where either too much or too little water was retained for the vine to sustain quality production.\n\nWith Federal and local help from the government many German vineyard owners were able to redesign and replant their vineyards to optimize maintenance and harvesting. Several vineyards also took the opportunity to upgrade their plantings from the lower-quality Müller-Thurgau grape to the high-quality Riesling vine. Some wine areas also improved the roads and access to their vineyards to increase tourism potential. In some cases, parcels of land that were spread out over different areas were reallocated among vineyard owners to reduce production cost.\n\nIn areas where not winegrowers but ″ordinary″ farmers are the target group, it is normally the size of the parcels and the better infrastructure which are the aim of the land consolidation. In current days also community and regional development and environment protection are the target.\n\nInvolved in a \"Flurbereiningung\" are the participants, who are owners and leaseholders of the affected land, as well as the holders of rights of the land lots, the affected municipality, public agencies and farmer associations. The participants may incorporate to a body of public right which is controlled by a public authority and called \"Teilnehmergemeinschaft\", best translated as association of participants. According to the Flurbereinigungsgesetz these bodies may form a union within a federal country. All unions have integrated into \"Bundesverband der Teilnehmergemeinschaften\", federal alliance of associations of participants.\n\nThe area of a \"Flurbereiningung\" shall be formed for the greatest benefit for the participants but also for the general public. Public ways and constructions such as channels and straitening of creeks are built, land improvement is carried out, and the landscape is rearranged according to regional development and country planning. Thereafter ways and constructions are normally in possession of the municipality. It is desirable that the estates of land are as homogeneously as possible distributed among the participants. As this is not always possible, proceedings against the distribution are not rare.\n\nA very negative example of \"Flurbereinigung\" occurred in the first half of the 70's at Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg), when great terraces where created with an inclination in direction to the hillside. The idea was to store water in the area, but heavy rains in the Pentecost week in 1983 led to flooding. Moreover, due to the inclination of the terraces in springtime (blooming time of the wine) cold air was settles, leading to frequent frost damage to the crops. \n\n"}

It is also known as Naryn (in Xinjiang, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), as Turama/Dograma (in Karakalpakstan, North Caucasus and Turkmenistan) and as Kullama (in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan).\n\nThe term \"Beshbarmak\" means \"five fingers\", because nomads used to eat this dish with their hands. The boiled meat is finely chopped with knives, mixed with boiled noodles, and spiced with onion sauce. It is usually served in a big round dish. Beshbarmak is usually served with shorpo – mutton broth in bowls called \"kese\". Typically, shorpo is served as a first course that is followed by courses of beshbarmak and a drink called ak-serke (shorpo spiced with kymyz or ayran).\n\nThe cuisine of Central Asia developed within the constraints of a nomadic life, when people were completely reliant on their animals which is reflected in their food, which is rich in meat and dairy products.\n\nThe serving of beshbarmak is steeped in ritual with different sections of the meat proportioned to people depending on their gender, age and rank in the social structure. On special occasions, a lamb's head may be served on the table. It is served to the most respected person, and he cuts off pieces from her and treats others with various desires. Festive beshbarmak could be cooked with Kazy together.\n\nNo special equipment is needed to make Beshbarmak. A pot to boil the meat and noodles in is required, as well as a rolling pin and knife to prepare the pasta. Beshbarmak is an easy dish to prepare. \nInitially meat is boiled. In the original version of Beshbarmak you should ideally use a piece of hind quarters (rump) of a horse, kazy and sujuk (horse meat products), rack of lamb . It may change with the seasons. In warm seasons, beshbarmak is usually cooked using meat lamb. \nAt the same time we make dough using flour, water and eggs, add salt and let it sit for 40 minutes. After that we roll out the pastry, making it very thin, and cut it into noodles. \nThe noodles are boiled in meat-broth for 5–7 minutes. The boiled noodles and finely chopped meat is placed on a tray (\"tabak\") and sauce (called \"chyk\" or \"tuzdyk\", made of onion, ground black pepper and hot meat-broth) is poured. Then everything is thoroughly mixed. Finely chopped meat in beshbarmak is a sign of respect for elders and guests.\nPresentation is also important. The dish is served on big platter. Hospitality is serious business in Central Asia. Ordinarily, being invited for beshbarmak is an honor. Guests are never invited to sit at an empty table, but beshbarmak is always presented after all the guests have been assembled. It is still a dish that carries with it nomadic identity, and not one to be taken lightly.\n\n"}

The breakdown starts when reverse voltage is applied. In the case of Zener breakdown, it starts at a particular voltage. In this diode the voltage remains relatively constant (independent of current) when it is connected in reverse bias. The backward diode is a special form of tunnel diode in which the tunneling phenomenon is only incipient, and the negative resistance region virtually disappears. The forward current is very small and becomes equivalent to the reverse current of a conventional diode.\n\nSince it has low capacitance and no charge storage effect, and a strongly nonlinear small-signal characteristic, the backward diode can be used as a detector up to 40 GHz.\n\nA backward diode can be used for rectifying weak signals with peak amplitudes of 0.1 to 0.7 V.\n\nA backward diode can be used in high speed switching applications.\n"}

Originating in Native American cuisine, they are a traditional sweet and savory snack in the Southern United States, as well as Indonesia where they are known as \"perkedel jagung\" or \"bakwan jagung\".\n\nNative Americans had been using ground corn (maize) as food for thousands of years before European explorers arrived in the New World. Corn-based products, such as corn flatbread, arepa and cornbread were staple foods in Pre-Columbian Americas. Native Americans did not use deep frying techniques, however, which require ample supplies of cooking oil as well as equipment in which the oil can be heated to high temperatures.\n\nEuropean settlers learned recipes and processes for corn dishes from Native Americans, and soon devised their own cornmeal-based variations of European breads made from grains available on that continent. The corn fritter probably was invented in the Southern United States, whose traditional cuisine contains a lot of deep fried foods, none more famous perhaps than Southern fried chicken.\n\nOn the other side of the world, maize seeds from the Americas were introduced into Southeast Asia in the late 16th century through Spanish and Portuguese traders. The plant thrived in the tropical climate of Indonesia, and soon became a staple food plant in drier areas of central and southeastern Indonesia, since it requires much less water than wet rice. Coconut and palm oil have been essential elements of Indonesian cuisine for centuries. The deep fried technique using palm oil was probably borrowed from Portuguese colonists; and Indonesia has its own type of corn fritter, called \"perkedel jagung\" or \"bakwan jagung\".\n\nTraditional corn fritters in the American South use corn kernels, egg, flour, milk, and melted butter. They can be deep fried, shallow fried, baked, and may be served with jam, fruit, honey, or cream. They may also be made with creamed corn, baked, and served with maple syrup. Corn fritters can be made to have a similar appearance to, and thus be mistaken for, johnnycake.\n\nIndonesian corn fritters are not sweet but savoury. They have a more granulated texture, as the corn kernels are not finely ground and blended into the dough, so they retain their kernel shapes. The fritter is made from fresh corn kernels, wheat flour, rice flour, celery, scallion, eggs, shallots, garlic, salt and pepper, and deep fried in coconut oil. They are a popular snack and are often served as an appetizer.\n"}

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.\n\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.\n\nFruits that are commonly candied include dates, cherries, pineapple, and a root, ginger. The principal candied peels are orange and citron; these with candied lemon peel are the usual ingredients of mixed chopped peel (which may also include glacé cherries).\n\nRecipes vary from region to region, but the general principle is to boil the fruit, steep it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks, and then dry off any remaining water.\n\nFood preservation methods using sugar (palm syrup and honey) were known to the ancient cultures of China and Mesopotamia. However, the precursors of modern candying were the Arabs, who served candied citrus and roses at the important moments of their banquets . With the Arab domination of parts of southern Europe, candied fruit made its way to the West. In Italy, they became a key ingredient of some of the most famous sweets of its culinary tradition: among these, the Milanese panettone and Cassata Siciliana.\n\nCandied fruits such as cherries are commonly used in fruitcakes or pancakes.\n\n"}

{"id": "14409748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14409748", "title": "Finnish bread", "text": "Finnish bread\n\nIn Finland, bread is a very important food, served with almost every meal with many different types produced domestically.\n\nIn the Swedish-speaking region of Åland, there are other varieties of bread, the majority of which owe much to Swedish cuisine.\n\nRye bread (Ruisleipä or hapanleipä (lit. \"sour bread\") in Finnish) is a dark, sour bread produced in quantity in Finland, where it is the most popular type of bread. Compared with the more internationally popular German style, Finnish rye-breads tend to be less oily or moist in texture. The most common types of Finnish rye breads are not sweet nor contain spices like caraway, unlike Swedish rye breads. As well as traditional breads more modern, softer breads exist as well these days. Rye bread is notable for its resistance to spoiling; it may store for weeks or months without developing mold. Additionally, if left on the table, it quickly dries into a crisp that stores indefinitely.\n\nTraditional Eastern Finnish rye bread is called \"limppu\". The closest translation to English would be loaf, but that does not actually describe the round, bulbous bread that is actually known as limppu, and could cause confusion as rectangular loaves are also available and are not called limppu. This bread is dark, sour in taste, dense, heavy and comparatively dryish. Its mouthfeel still remains soft enough to be bitten off easily, and leavening is easily discernible even by eye. This kind of bread was usually produced at steady intervals throughout the year, whereas Western Finnish tradition stressed rare baking sessions combined with long-term storage.\n\nLimppu is common in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan due to high levels of Finnish immigration and may be found in many pubs and diners across the peninsula.\n\nTraditional Western Finnish rye bread (reikäleipä lit. \"hole bread\") was dried near the kitchen ceiling and preserved over the long winter into its many forms. Nowadays this kind of bread is available in all its forms and stages of aging throughout the whole of Finland, regardless of season.\n\n\"Vaasan Ruispala\", (lit. \"rye piece\") a brand of rye bread by Vaasan, is Finland's \"most popular bread\" according to the company. It is otherwise similar to \"reikäleipä\", but is more consumer-oriented. It comes in single portion size, it mixes condensed rye bread taste with zero-day delivery, it borrows from the German rye bread tradition in keeping a more humid, greasier texture than is traditional in Finland, and it makes the best of the humidity preserving qualities of traditional rye bread by serving each piece of bread as a pre-cut pair of two halves, which protect each other but can still be easily separated.\n\nThe brand is not without competitors. Two of them are Fazer's \"Ruispuikulat\" (a newer competitor), which are oblong in shape instead, and Oululainen's \"Reissumies\" (preceding Vaasa's formulation by about a decade), which are round. Both competitors are distinctly more traditional in formulation than Ruispala, mainly changing the size and shape of the traditional rye bread. As rye bread is the staple one in Finland, the competition among the brands remains fierce to this day.\n\nThe old tradition was that all bread in the house for the year was baked in a few days, in a large oven that took a long time to cool after being fired. Thus, \"jälkiuunileipä\" (lit. \"after-oven bread\") could still be baked in the residual heat. The longer baking time in the lower temperature gives it a darker color, higher density and hardness than regular rye bread, comparable to a fruit cake. In addition to the traditional \"reikäleipä\" shape, there are also rectangular \"ruispala\"-type pieces available.\n\nCrispbread (näkkileipä in Finnish) are leavened rye breads that are dried into thin crisp. They are sometimes made using sour dough. Crispbread are very common throughout the Nordic countries and if stored properly will not spoil for a long time. Variants of crisp bread are thicker (½ cm), air-containing crisps (called just \"näkkileipä\") and thinner sour crisps (\"hapankorppu\"). The most common type, often stereotypically associated with schools and other institutions, is rectangular in shape, e.g. \"Koulunäkki\" and \"Kunto\" brands. A round shape is another variant. \"Hapankorppu\" is rectangular.\n\nBecause traditionally wheat was not as abundant as rye or barley, wheat is mainly used for baking of pastry, scones, pulla and nowadays is often combined with other types of flour to make things like Karelian pasties and meat pies. There are a few wheat breads in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread.\n\nVesirinkeli (\"water ring\") are small rings of yeast leavened wheat bread; which resemble bagels. They are available in several different varieties in supermarkets.\n\nThere are countless varieties of breads throughout Finland and it would be impossible to catalogue them all, however there are some important types which do not fit in other areas, and they are mentioned below.\n\nOats (kaura) are the most commonly produced grain in Finland so it makes sense that bread based on oats will be very popular, although not as popular as rye breads. The most common use in bread is in rolls or buns (sämpylä) or in flat soft bread pieces similar to ruispalat or reissumies rye breads.\n\nThe potato, although a late introduction to Finland, features heavily in the diet and has found its way into many kinds of breads. Usually dough made with potato will be very soft and the bread will be moister and fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread.\n\nThere are several varieties of Christmas breads, however most are made in a similar way to a basic ruislimppu bread however they typically include molasses and other Christmas time flavours like orange, cinnamon, fennel, aniseed and caraway.\n\nKorppu (rusk in English) are hard and crisp, resembling small bread rolls but usually halved and much harder. The sweet versions are often sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. There are also variations of korppu which are totally flat and unleavened, usually made of either rye or oats. The flat ones are called hapankorppu In Finland.\n\nRieska (pronounced ['ries.ka]) is unleavened, usually barley-based, soft flat bread. They are often served warm and buttered and consumed with milk. The most simple rieskas contain only flour, salt, and water, but industrial bakeries usually use yeast as well. Rieskas are baked in the oven but they may be baked on a frying pan (like pancake) or even on a heated stone as well. The most common kinds of rieska are:\n\n\nBarley rieska is a local speciality in northern parts of Finland, especially in Lapland and North Ostrobothnia, but some rieskas are manufactured by major bakery companies and therefore commonly available in grocery stores all around the country.\n\nPulla is a cardamom flavoured, yeast-leavened sweetened bread, often served with coffee. The usual recipe is based on milk, sugar, wheat flour, butter, with yeast and a very small amount of salt as additives, and cardamom or saffron as spices. Pulla is similar, but drier than a brioche, as eggs are not added into the dough. In contrast to other nationalities' sweetened breads, these are not buttered. Pulla, when made into a roll with cinnamon and sugar and cut into spirals before baking, becomes \"korvapuusti\" (cinnamon roll).\n\nA korppu (rusk, see above) is sweetened with sugar and spiced with cinnamon.\n\n\n"}

The Pimp Juice team was driven by Nelly himself and organized by former Fillmore Street Brewery President, Demetrius Denham.\n\nPimp Juice started as a mostly regional product, with distribution limited to the Midwest (Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois and Michigan), but expanded nationally quickly to meet the demand created by national media coverage.\n\nSince 2003, Pimp Juice has expanded internationally into Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South Africa.\n\nPimp Juice made national headlines when several cultural groups and women's organizations, including Project Islamic H.O.P.E., the National Alliance For Positive Action, the National Black Anti-Defamation League and the Messianic Afrikan Nation, called for a national boycott of Pimp Juice Energy Drink and all stores that carried the product. \n\nNaji Ali, the director of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., one of the leaders of the boycott, stated that the drink \"Contributes to negative and demeaning stereotypes of African-Americans\", while others said that the name \"degrades women and glorifies a pimp lifestyle\". Paul Scott of the Afrikan Nation has also expressed concerns that the drink promotes the wrong leadership and lifestyle that is required in the black community.\nDemetrius Denham, co-founder of Fillmore Street Brewery, was one of the first to speak out publicly in defense of Pimp Juice when he told BET.com \"the term \"pimp\" has changed meaning over the years and doesn't have the same connotation to youth. I think it's a word that has changed significance over the last 10 to 15 years\".\n\nNelly defended the product as \"Pimp Juice is anything that attracts the opposite sex; it could be money, fame, or straight intellect; it don't matter! Pimp Juice is color blind; you find it works on all colors, creeds and kinds; from ages 50 right down to nine.\" He noted that a portion of the proceeds from the drink will go to his philanthropic organization, 4Sho4Kids.\n\nWhile these protests created a storm of negative media coverage, they did little to slow the sales of Pimp Juice. A company spokeswoman said the company sold over one million cans of Pimp Juice in the first 3 months of operations.\n\n\n"}

This is then cut and rolled into thin strips of about half a centimetre thickness which are formed into rings, briefly cooked in boiling sugar water, then baked in an oven. The rings are generally about 3 to 5 cm in size. Sushki are sometimes topped with poppy seeds.\n\nTraditionally, sushki were strung on a string for selling on the street or at regional markets. Nowadays, industrially produced pre-packaged sushki are sold in food shops all over the countries of the former Soviet Union. In other countries, packaged sushki can be found in markets that sell Russian foods.\n\nSushki belong to a class of Eastern European ring-shaped bread products which are briefly boiled before baking. Belarusian and Russian baranki are larger and softer, but still rather dense such that they are often dipped into tea like sushki. Ukrainian bubliki and Polish obwarzanki are even larger and softer, but not as soft as Jewish bagels. All such products are also commonly referred to as \"bubliki\" in Russian and Ukrainian. Alternatively, they are called generically \"baranki\" in Russian, \"obarinki\" in Ukrainian and \"abaranki\" in Belarusian. \"Baranka-type products\" () is a formal designation of the product class. \"Bublitchki\", a diminutive of bubliki, is sometimes used to denote small-size products of this class, in particular, sushki.\n\nTaralli are similar Italian bread rings.\n\n"}

{"id": "14443478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14443478", "title": "Javanese cuisine", "text": "Javanese cuisine\n\nJavanese cuisine is the cuisine of Javanese people, a major ethnic group in Indonesia, more precisely the province of Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java. Though the cuisine of Sumatra is known for its spiciness with notable Indian and Arabic influences, Javanese cuisine is more indigenously developed and noted for its simplicity. Some of Javanese dishes demonstrate foreign influences, most notably Chinese. \n\nSome Indonesians perceive Javanese cuisine as sweeter compared to other Indonesian dishes, because of the liberal use of \"gula jawa\" (palm sugar) or \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce). Javanese food is categorized into Central and East Javanese food; both simple and non-spicy food, though Central Javanese food tends to be sweeter.\n\nIn a wider sense, Javanese cuisine might also refer to the cuisine of the whole people of Java Island, Indonesia; which also include Sundanese in West Java, Betawi people in Jakarta and Madurese on Madura Island off East Java. These ethnic groups have their own distinctive cuisines.\n\nJavanese cuisine is largely divided into three major groups:\n\nThere are similarities in these cuisines but the main differences lie in the flavors. Central Javanese cuisine tend to be sweeter and less spicy, while East Javanese cuisine uses less sugar and more chili, possibly influenced by Madurese cuisine or Indian cuisine.\n\nJavanese cooking tradition has a long history, derived from Javanese indigenous elements, and along its history, was enrichen by foreign influences — including Indian, Chinese and European influences. Ancient dishes and recipes was mentioned in numbers of Javanese \"prasasti\" (inscription) and modern historians has been succeed on deciphered some of them. The inscriptions from Medang Mataram era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are \"Hadangan Harang\" (water buffalo minced meat satay, similar with today Balinese \"sate lilit\"), \"Hadangan Madura\" (water buffalo meat with sweet palm sugar), and \"Dundu Puyengan\" (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Ancient beverages include \"Nalaka Rasa\" (sugarcane juice), \"Jati Wangi\" (jasmine beverage), and \"Kinca\" (tamarind juice). Also various \"Kuluban\" (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today \"urab\") and \"Phalamula\" (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar).\n\nRice is an important food crop in Java, dating back to ancient times. The Javanese are known to revere Dewi Sri as the Rice Goddess. Steamed rice is the common staple food, and is served at every meal. \"Tumpeng\", a cone-shaped yellow rice is essential in slametan, Javanese traditional ceremonies. Rice can be processed into \"lontong\" or \"ketupat\", or cooked in coconut milk as \"nasi liwet\" or colored with turmeric as \"nasi kuning\" (yellow rice). Other sources of carbohydrate such as \"gaplek\" (dried cassava) is sometimes mixed into rice or replaces rice. \"Gaplek\" is usually consumed by poor commoners during hard times when rice is scarce. Tubers such as yam, taro, and sweet potato are consumed as snacks in between meals. Bread and grains other than rice are uncommon, although noodles and potatoes are often served as accompaniments to rice. Potatoes are often boiled then mashed, shaped into discs, spiced, coated in beaten eggs and fried into \"perkedel\". Wheat noodles, \"bihun\" (rice vermicelli), and \"kwetiau\" are influences of Chinese cuisine. The Javanese adopted these ingredients and made them their own by adding \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce) and local spices to create \"bakmi Jawa\", \"bakmi rebus\", and \"bihun goreng\". Vegetables feature heavily in Javanese cuisine, notably in vegetable-heavy dishes such as \"pecel\", \"lotek\", and \"urap\".\n\nCoconut milk, peanut sauce, \"gula jawa\" (palm sugar), \"asem jawa\" (tamarind), \"petis\", \"terasi\" (shrimp paste), shallot, garlic, turmeric, galangal, ginger, and chili \"sambal\" are common ingredients and spices that can be found in Javanese cuisine. Freshwater fishes such as carp, tilapia, gourami and catfish are popular, while seafood such as tuna, red snapper, wahoo, ray, anchovy, shrimp, squid, and various salted fish are popular in coastal Javanese cities. Chicken, goat meat, mutton and beef are popular meats in Javanese cuisine. Next to common farmed chicken, the \"ayam kampung\" or free-range chicken, is popular and valued for its leaner, more natural flavors. Almost 90% of Javanese are Muslim, and consequently, much of Javanese cuisine omits pork. However, in small enclaves of Catholic Javanese population around Muntilan, Magelang, Yogyakarta, and Klaten, pork might be consumed. Few ethnic groups in Indonesia use pork and other sources of protein considered \"haram\" under Muslim dietary laws in their cuisine, most prominently Balinese cuisine, Indonesian Chinese cuisine, and Manado cuisine.\n\nCompared to the spicy and curry-like cuisine of Sumatra that is heavily influenced by Indian cuisine, Javanese cuisine is most notably Chinese and European with a some local touch. Javanese cuisine in different areas show different foreign influences. For example, Chinese influences in Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Cirebon; Indian and Arabic influences in Surabaya, Lamongan, and Gresik; and European influences in Solo and Malang.\n\nJavanese cuisine may also have contributed and influenced foreign cuisines. Javanese \"botok\", for example, has influenced the South African bobotie dish. Because of the dispersion of Javanese people outside of Indonesia, the Javanese cuisine has influenced the cuisine of Johor in Malaysia, Singapore and the cuisine of Suriname. The influence of Javanese cuisine has contributed significantly to the food of Johor. Malaysian-Javanese dishes such as \"nasi ambeng\", \"soto ayam\", \"pecel\", \"tempe\", and \"sambal tempe\" are popular in Malaysia.\n\nJavanese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Javanese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and \"warung\"s, to fancy restaurants in five-star hotels. Small family-run \"warung\"s are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods. The popular simple Javanese cuisine establishments are the budget food of \"Warung Tegal,\" which are mainly established by Javanese from Tegal city, and the \"Angkringan\" street side carts in Yogyakarta and Solo that sold cheap \"sego kucing\" and various \"wedang\" (hot beverages).\nIn Javanese tradition, it is common to dine in \"lesehan\" style, which is sitting cross-legged on the mat while dining in front of short-legged table. It was started as a \"warung\" lesehan street food dining popular among tourists along Malioboro street in Yogyakarta. Today, Javanese \"lesehan\" foodstalls can be found in several cities, including Surakarta, Semarang and Jakarta.\n\nThe food in Central Java is influenced by the two ancient kingdoms of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (also commonly known as Solo). Most of Central Javanese dishes are indigenously developed, however in coastal cities such as Semarang and Pekalongan, notable Chinese influences can be seen, such as \"lumpia\" (spring roll) and \"bakmi Jawa\". While in royal court of Surakarta, the European influences can be seen, such as \"bistik Jawa\" and \"selat Solo\". Many of Central Java-specific dishes contain the names of the area where the food first became popular, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefers to Javanese cultural region of Western Central Java bordering West Java, including Banyumas, Tegal, Brebes, Cilacap, Kebumen, and Purwokerto regencies.\n\n\nThe East Javanese cuisine is largely influenced by Madurese cuisine - Madura being a major producer of salt, hence the omission of sugar in many dishes. Many of the East Javanese dishes are also typically Madurese, such as \"soto\" Madura and \"sate\" Madura, usually sold by Madurese settlers. Notable Arabic and Indian cuisine influence also can be found such in the coastal cities of Tuban, Gresik, Surabaya, Lamongan, and Sidoarjo, due to the large number of Arabic descendants in these cities. Although there are many dishes with town names attached to them, local versions of these are available in every town. The most popular town-associated dishes are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the common Javanese dishes, which can be found throughout Java regardless of the location.\n"}

{"id": "14449632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14449632", "title": "Dental public health", "text": "Dental public health\n\nDental Public Health (DPH) is a non-clinical specialty of dentistry that deals with the prevention of oral disease and promotion of oral health. Dental public health is involved in the assessment of key dental health needs and coming up with effective solutions to improve the dental health of populations rather than individuals.\n\nPrevention is becoming increasingly important. Dental related diseases are largely preventable and there is a growing burden on health care systems for cure. Dental public health looks beyond the role of a dental practitioner in treating dental disease, and seeks to reduce demand on health care systems by redirection of resources to priority areas. Countries around the world all face similar issues in relation to dental disease. Implementation of policies and principles vary due to available of resources. Similar to public health, an understanding of the many factors that influence health will assist the implementation of effective strategies.\n\nPublic health dentistry, is practiced generally through government sponsored programs, which are for the most part directed toward public-school children in the belief that their education in oral hygiene is the best way to reach the general public. The pattern for such programs in the past was a dental practitioners annual visit to a school to lecture and to demonstrate proper tooth-brushing techniques. The 1970s saw the emergence of a more elaborate program that included a week of one-hour sessions of instruction, demonstration, and questions and answers, conducted by a dentist and a dental assistant and aided by a teacher who had previously been given several hours of instruction. Use was also made of televised dental health education programs, which parents were encouraged to observe.\n\nThere seems to be a lot more that can be done to help individuals prevent tooth decay and gum disease based on what is already known.\n\nEven with fluoridation and oral hygiene, tooth decay is still the most common diet–related disease affecting many people. Tooth decay has the economic impact of heart disease, obesity and diabetes.\n\nDental decay is however easily prevented by reducing acid demineralisation caused by the remaining dental plaque left on teeth after brushing. Risk factors for tooth decay include physical, biological, environmental, behavioural, and lifestyle-related factors such as high numbers of cariogenic bacteria, inadequate salivary flow, insufficient fluoride exposure, poor oral hygiene, inappropriate methods of feeding infants, and poverty.' Neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with fluoridated toothpaste will assist prevention.\n\nCavities can develop on any surface of a tooth, but are most common inside the pits and fissures in grooves on chewing surfaces. This is where the toothbrush bristles and fluoride toothpaste cannot reach effectively.\n\nGum diseases gingivitis and periodontitis are caused by certain types of bacteria that accumulate in remaining dental plaque. The extent of gum disease depends a lot on host susceptibility.\n\nDaily brushing must include brushing of both the teeth and gums. Effective brushing itself, will prevent progression of both dental decay and gum diseases. Neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with fluoridated toothpaste will assist preventing dental decay. Stimulating saliva flow assists in the remineralisation process of teeth, this can be done by chewing sugar free gum. Using an interdental device once daily will assist prevention of gum diseases.\n\nFissure sealants applied over the chewing surfaces of teeth, block plaque from being trapped inside pits and fissures. The sealants make brushing more effective and prevent acid demineralisation and tooth decay. A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates will reduce the buildup of plaque on teeth.\n\nThe American Board of Dental Public Health (ABDPH) have devised a list of competencies for dental public health specialists to follow. Dental public health specialists are a select group of certified dentists. The 10 competencies allow for growth and learning of individuals and set expectations for the future. An advantage of the design is that they are implementable on a global level. The list is updated periodically.\n\nMajor areas of dental public health activity include:\n\nNational Oral Health Surveillance system (NOHSS) is designed to monitor the effects of oral disease on the population, as well as monitor how the oral care is delivered. Additionally the status of water fluoridation on both a state and a national level is continually supervised \n\nDental health is concerned with promoting health of an entire population and focuses on an action at a community level, rather than at an individual clinical approach. Dental public health is a broad subject that seeks to expand the range of factors that influences peoples oral health and the most effective means of preventing and treating these oral health problems.\n\nTo allow a health problem to be properly managed, it is important that there is a set of rules or criteria to follow which determines what is defined as a public health problem and what is the best way to manage health problems in communities. The following are questions should be considered when addressing public health problems:\n\nOnce these questions have been answered, the way a public health problem is acted upon to protect a population can be determined.\n\nWater fluoridation is the implementation of artificial fluoride in public water supplies with the intentions to halt the progression of dental diseases. Fluoride has the ability to interfere with the demineralisation and remineralisation process that occurs on the tooth surface and improves the mineral intake when the pH level may reduce below the neutral pH level.\n\nThis achievement was implemented through the public health development in the 19th, 20th century and led into the 21st century. Research into the effects of fluoride on teeth began due to the concern about the presence of dental fluorosis.\n\nMany clinical case trials occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. However, the very first clinical trial to have occurred dates back to the 19th century when Denninger conducted a trial prescribing children and pregnant women with calcium fluoride. From this trial it was recognised fluoride’s significance on tooth tissue and from this point, many clinical trials were conducted \nFollowing these studies, the recognition of the positive outcome on dental tissues became clear and projects in water fluoridation became of significant importance.\n\nThe development of artificial water fluoridation began in 1945 in the Grand rapid Michigan followed by Newburgh, New York and Evanston, Illinois. In 1955 three towns Watford, Kilmarnock and Anglesey trialled the water fluoridation implementation scheme. In 1960 the Republic of Ireland implemented all public water supplies with artificial fluoridated water and four years later extending this into the main cities of Dublin and Cork.\n\nCurrently, 40 countries have fluoridated water schemes implemented. Fluoride is still yet to be completely implemented across the full population however, progress is slowly improving and access is becoming more common.\n\nPrevention methods such as oral health promotion began with the education of clinicians and the population in the health promotion strategies. Since the mid 19th century oral health practice has revolved more around prevention and education rather than treatment of disease. This education can be focused towards dental practitioners and to the wider population who may interested.\n\nThere has been a change in focus in the education of developing clinicians all over the world. The first dental school was developed in 1828 and was followed by an ever-growing field of practice. The dental practice began with its main focus on the treatment of oral disease and branched into a wide scope of practice with many dental occupations involved.\n\nThe most common form of dental clinicians are either general dentists, oral health therapists, dental therapists and dental hygienist. When desired, some of these clinicians may seek further experience in projects that may assist the dental public system in bringing further awareness to prevention of dental diseases.\n\nOral health prevention is the current form of practice of many clinicians. As education in oral care to the population is now believed to be the superior solution rather than the treatment of disease. Dental university education now develops clinicians to focus on the education of patients, education of the community and a wider population using different approaches.\n\nOral Health Promotion outlines the strategies for improving and educating the general public about how they can better take improve and maintain their current oral health. Oral health promotion is part of both government and private incentives to create a healthier and better educated generation of individuals.\n\nThese are the nine key principles involved for oral health promotion: \n\nThere are three important way in achieving oral health promotion, which is done by addressing the determinants of oral health, community participation, and implementing a strategy approach that involves a range of complementary actions.\n\nDeterminants of oral health\n\nOral health promotion focuses on individual behaviour, the Socioeconomic status and environmental factors. Underlying determinants that can also impact oral health, including non-milk extrinsic sugars consumption, alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour.\n\nThe ability to remove dental plaque, exposure to fluoride and access to quality dental care can affect the ways the aforementioned underlying factors are and can be modified to the needs of the individual to obtain optimum oral health. Ways in which oral health promotion can minimise the effects of these determinants;\n\nIt is also important to note that these factors are also influenced by socio-political considerations that are outside the control of most individuals.\n\nCommunity participation is a key factor in oral health promotion. Inter-sectoral collaboration is where relevant agencies and sectors are involved in partnership to identify key oral health issues and to implement new methods to improve oral health.\n\nThe World Health Organization has agreed on a health promotion approach as the foundation for oral health improvement strategies and policies for the population. Oral health promotion is based on the principles of the framework, Ottawa Charter. There are five areas of action outlined to achieve oral health promotion; building Health public policy, creating supportive environment, strengthening community action, developing personal skills, re-orienting healthcare services.\n\nA study investigating the efficacy of staff workers' oral care education on improving the oral health of care home residents found that despite the education and training of care workers, certain ongoing barriers prevented them from conducting the necessary daily oral hygiene care for the residents. The most frequently listed obstacles to care included the residents' bad breath, inadequate time to perform oral care and uncooperative residents who do not perceive the need for oral care.\n\n\nTo find out if a child is eligible, families can contact the Department of Human Services \n\n\nFor information and eligibility criteria on each state or territory’s public dental services, visit your State Health Department website\n\n\nIn 1985 three dentists with the sponsorship of Colonel Joy Wheeler Dow, Jr., implemented an Oral Health Program in the Autonomous Region of Madeira with the aid of five assistants.\n\nThe four-year program reached 15,000 children around the main island and Porto Santo and it included Oral Hygiene Instruction classes, informative literature including films, fortnightly fluoride mouth-rinse and daily fluoride tables with the collaboration of the school teachers.\n\nDuring this period a study was undertaken using the World Health Organization (WHO) Combined Oral Health Assessment (CPTIN) plan resulting in the final report where it was found that there had been a decrease of 44% in the need for fillings, 40% decrease in the need for extractions, whilst the caries free children population grew from the initial 1% to 5%.\n\nNational Health Service (NHS) is the name of the public health services of England, Scotland and Wales and is directly funded from taxation. The dentistry services are available to all, regardless of wealth. In order to find a NHS dentist search NHS Dentist Near You Some clinics may not have the capacity to take on new patients so waiting lists may occur.\n\nAll treatment deemed necessary to maintain optimal oral health will be provided by the dentist, however not all treatments will be funded by the Dentistry NHS and will incur private fees.\n\nDentistry performed under the Dentistry NHS will involve fees, however are heavily subsidized by the government, below is some information which explains how the fee’s system works, only one charge is required per treatment course of care, regardless of the amount of appointments needed \n\nNepalese population is at a greater disadvantage than westernized societies in terms of oral health. The benefit of implementing health insurance is to assist a large number of people with similar risks by sharing funding. In Nepal, implementing health insurance is difficult due to limited supply of finances. To assist families with accessing health care “elimination of direct payments is necessary but is not sufficient alone; costs of transportation and loss of income can have more impact than direct payment of services” must be considered.\n\n\nFor more information, you can access the Around Good People fact sheet\n\nThe earliest known person identified as a dental practitioner dates back to 2600BC, an Egyptian scribe states that he was ‘the greatest of those who deal with teeth ad of physicians’\n\n\n"}

The pastry is a light and flaky dough filled with a variety of sweet and savory fillings such as apricot, raspberry, prune, sweet cheese, poppy seed or even a nut mixture. Variants of the traditional Slavic pastry have found entrance into many Central and Eastern European cuisines, e.g. the Czech leven yeast dough called kolache (\"koláč\"). When the dough and filling mixture is rolled it is also known as a \"makowiec\", \"makownik\", \"poteca\", \"strucla z makiem\" (poppy seed strusel), \"strucla orzechowa\" (walnut strusel), \"strucla z migdałami\" (almonds strusel). In Hungarian this is called, Diós-mákos Beigli or Bejgli. Some sprinkle the roll with poppy seeds or powdered sugar on top and can be baked in a circular pan or long-ways in a jelly pan like a log.\n\nThe Polish pastry is made from a special dough that combines cream cheese with butter and flour. This ingredient mixture gives it a unique flakey quality similar to a pie crust. For individual servings, the dough is rolled thin and then cut into squares. A thin line of the filling is spread along the diagonal of the square. Then two opposing corners are folded over each other to create the unique shape of the pastry. When made in a large batch or in a roll, servings are sliced off like bread.\n\n\n"}

A particular variant, Ezekiel bread, is often said to be baked with the sins of the baker. In biblical times, this is why sprouted bread was avoided. There are a few different types of sprouted grain bread. Some are made with additional added flour, some are made with added gluten, and some, such as Essene bread, are made with very few additional ingredients.\n\nThese are breads that contain the whole grain (or kernel, or berry) of various seeds after they have been sprouted. They are different from “white” bread inasmuch as “white” breads are made from ground wheat endosperm (after removal of the bran and germ). Whole grain breads include the bran, germ, and endosperm, therefore providing more fiber, and naturally occurring vitamins and proteins. Sprouted (or germinated) grain breads have roughly the same amount of vitamins per gram. Sprouted grain bread has 47% less gluten than regular bread.\n\nA comparison of nutritional analyses shows that sprouted grains contain about 75% of the energy (carbohydrates), slightly higher protein and about 40% of the fat when compared to whole grains.\n\nWheat is not the only grain used in sprouted breads. Grains and legumes such as millet, barley, oat, lentil and soy may be used. Bread that is made from an array of grains and legumes can provide a complete set of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Sprouted breads may contain slightly more trace minerals and nutrients than non-sprouted breads. Other than that, they supply much the same advantages as whole grain breads over refined grain breads, such as lowered risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nEssene bread is a very primitive form of sprouted grain bread made from sprouted wheat and prepared at a low temperature. It is often eaten uncooked, or slightly heated, by proponents of raw foods. The Essenes, a Jewish religious group that flourished from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD, are credited with the technique and basic recipes for Essene bread, although no scholarly evidence exists for this claim. Sprouting and low-temperature preparation ensure the maximum possible vitamin content for this foodstuff. Sprouting also breaks down the lectins and other substances that some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to.\n\n"}

They too sited their brewery on the River Liffey, a few hundred yards east of the Guinness site.\n\nCaffrey’s Irish Ale was re-launched in 1994 and marketed as a beer which combined features from other types of beer: it could be served as cold as lager, its texture would be as smooth as stout, while its taste was that of an ale. Though launched with little advertising, it was priced at the top end of the market and was made available in over 7500 pubs. Sales of Caffrey's for the first year were higher than expected for a new product, at around 150 000 barrels in its first year. It was designed to appeal to \"the ageing lager drinker...looking for a mature pint.\"\n\nCoors Brewing Company acquired the US distribution rights to Caffrey's in December, 2001 when they purchased UK based Carling Brewers who owned the rights previously. Sometime in 2002, after Coors purchased Caffrey's from Interbrew, it ceased importation of the beer into the United States market. Coors decided that continued sale of Caffrey's in the US would interfere with the branding of Killian's as Coors's premier Irish brew. Many Irish bars around the US still have Caffrey's paraphernalia, but no longer sell the beer.\n\nCoors's decision to sell Killian's over the nitrogen charged Caffrey's in the US market allowed Diageo, makers of Guinness, to gain market share with its Smithwick's brew in Irish bars throughout the US. Caffrey's is still available in the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nIn 2011 Caffrey's sold around 35,000 barrels in the UK, down from 200,000 in 2002.\n\nAt its launch Caffrey's was brewed to 5.2% ABV. In 2001 it was reduced to 4.2% and to 3.8% in 2010 in an attempt to halt declining sales. It is based on an 1897 recipe and is designed to be served between 4 and 6 degrees Celsius.\n\nCaffrey's was later launched in 14.9 oz cans, featuring a nitrogen pocket that agitates the beer when you open it giving it a characteristic closer to a draught beer. Nitrogen is less soluble than carbon dioxide, which allows the beer to be put under high pressure without making it fizzy. The high pressure of dissolved gas is required to enable very small bubbles to be formed by forcing the draught beer through fine holes in a plate in the tap, which causes the characteristic \"surge\" (the widget in cans and bottles achieves the same effect). The perceived smoothness of Caffrey's is due to its low level of carbon dioxide and the creaminess of the head caused by the very fine bubbles that arise from the use of nitrogen and the dispensing method described above.\n\nThomas Caffrey first established the Ulster Brewery in Queen Street, Belfast, in 1897. The brewery was sold to the Ulster Brewing Company in 1950. The last member of the family to have been active in the business, Nicholas James Caffrey, died in 1984, survived by two daughters, Virginia and Bridget (since deceased) and one son, Nicholas Philip Caffrey. The brewery was acquired by Charringtons (later Bass Charrington) in 1964 and then by Interbrew in 2000. On July 6, 2004, the owners of the former Caffrey's brewery, Interbrew, announced their intention to dispose of the site of the brewery. Having no takers, they closed the brewery in 2005.\nThe Caffrey's Ulster Brewery, established in Belfast in 1897 and taken over by Bass in 1974, closed in 2004, so ending big company brewing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n"}

Because of its popularity at least in the eastern part of Batangas, there are as many styles of cooking lomi as there are eateries, \"panciterias\" or restaurants offering the dish. Variations in recipes and quality are therefore very common.\n\nSmall pieces of meat (usually pork, sometimes chicken) and pork liver, are thinly sliced then sauteed with garlic and shallots. It is then cooked until tender. Next, salt, finely ground black pepper and other seasonings are added at this point. Then soup stock is added to prepare the broth. Next the lomi noodle and chopped cabbage is added. While waiting for the noodles to cook, a mixture of cornstarch flour blended with a small amount of water is added to thicken the soup. Finally, just before the whole mixture is transferred to individual bowls, a beaten egg is added as the cook continuously stirs to complete the basic dish. Toppings include slices of \"kikiam\" (\"que-kiam\"), fish balls, sliced chives, cooked shrimp, and some meatballs. Sometimes stir-fried ground meat (pork or chicken), as well as coarsely ground garlic roasted to golden brown are also available.\n\nLomi is typically cooked using a deep wok on LPG gas stove. About 9–10 minutes is the cooking time for a single serving of lomi.\n\nLomi is best eaten while steaming hot. It is a challenge to be able to finish eating before the bowl gets cold. To spice up the taste, depending on one's preference, a mixture of soy sauce, kalamansi juice and crushed fresh red chili peppers can be added to the dish as a condiment. The same soy sauce mixture can also be used as a dipping sauce for the meatballs, Other lomi patrons request a small amount of finely chopped fresh red onions to be eaten with the dish for extra pungency.\n\n\"Lomi haus\" or \"lomián\", \"panciteria\", \"eatery\", \"carinderia\", \"restaurant\" or their combination (e.g. lomi haus and eatery) are the most common terms used in Batangas to refer to a food establishment where lomi is served or eaten.\n\nA \"lomi haus\" specializes in lomi and other pancit dishes made of fresh egg noodles called \"miki\".

The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval. Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.\n\nAfter independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands. Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning. While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar Rossy authored his 1995 song \"Lera.\" The song was critical of the Zafy regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment. The most famous troupe is Ramilison Fenoarivo, Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.\n\nThe performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar. Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching lamba cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the Imperial period); and which instruments are used. Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned. Instead, the most common instruments are violins, trumpets, and snare and bass drums; the sodina, accordion, kabosy or clarinet may occasionally make an appearance.\n\nHiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of kabary. \n1. The Sasitehaka: Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm. The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.\n2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary): One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle. He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (\"indray miditra\") of the show through \"kabary\" - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating ohabolana (proverbs). \n3. The Renihira (Queen Song): The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them. This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions. \n4. The Dihy (Dance): The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes. A kabary (\"kabarindihy\") is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it. There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed. The true \"Dihy\" is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts. The \"Tsikandihy\" or \"Dihy Irery\" is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer. The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.\n5.

When the dough has risen, it can be braided to make it more decorative and festive. Some variations are topping it with chopped walnuts and vanilla icing, raisins added to the dough, cinnamon rolls, butter and sugar buns called voisilmäpulla, berry toppings and curd filled buns called rahkapulla.\n\nCardamom-flavored bread and buns (Finnish: \"pulla\" or \"nisu\"; , \"kardemummabullar\") are commonly eaten in Finland and Sweden.

Braided loaves (pitko) are formed from three or more strands of dough. The loaves may also be formed into a ring. They are typically coated with egg wash and then sprinkled with white sugar or almonds. Other types of pulla include small round ones that resemble English scones but have a sugar and butter topping, and larger cinnamon rolls called korvapuusti. The outside typically has a shiny brown glaze, formed by a coating of egg white, milk or a mixture of sugar and brewed coffee.\n\nPitko is typically served in slices. Round pulla is served as a whole. Pulla is often served with coffee in Finland.\n\nPulla is also common in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Northern Ontario, areas in the United States and Canada which have large Finnish populations. There it is also commonly known as nisu, an old Finnish word still in use with the same meaning in some dialects, despite originally simply meaning \"wheat\". \"Korppu\" is used instead to refer to a biscotti-like double-baked bread stick for dunking in coffee that is often made from leftover \"nisu\".\n\n\n"}

It is made from grain and is bottled at 120, 151 and 190 U.S. proof (60%, 75.5% and 95% alcohol by volume). Due to its market prevalence and high alcohol content, the product has become iconic, with a \"notorious reputation\" in popular culture. Sale of the 190-proof variation is prohibited in some states.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, Everclear \"should be viewed as an unfinished ingredient\", not consumed directly in undiluted form, and the company acknowledges that the product \"has a rather notorious reputation\" due to its high alcohol content. Rather than consuming Everclear directly, the company says it should be diluted by mixing it with water (to make vodka) or other ingredients until the alcohol strength of the drink is \"no more dangerous than other spirits or liqueurs on the shelf\". For example, ordinary vodka and gin have an alcohol concentration typically around 40% alcohol by volume (80 proof), and liqueurs are typically around 20% alcohol (40 proof).\n\nEverclear can also be used for extracting flavor from other ingredients to make infusions and tinctures. The company says that Everclear has \"an extremely neutral flavor profile\" and is \"virtually unbeaten in the realm of infusions\".\n\nLuxco also manufactures two other brands, Golden Grain alcohol and Crystal Clear alcohol, as essentially the same spirit with a different brand name. Several other brands of grain neutral spirits are also available on the market from other companies.\n\nEthanol cannot be concentrated by ordinary distillation to greater than 97.2% by volume (95.6% by weight), because at that concentration, the vapor has the same ratio of water to alcohol as the liquid, a phenomenon known as azeotropy. The 190-proof variation of Everclear is 92.4% ethanol by weight and is thus produced at approximately the practical limit of distillation purity.\n\nSome U.S. states impose limits on maximum alcohol content, or have other restrictions that prohibit the sale of the 190-proof variation of Everclear, and several of those also effectively prohibit lower-proof Everclear.\n\n\n"}

AD 800, resulting in a modern \"segnen\" \"to bless\". The noun \"Segen\" \"blessing\" was derived from the verb at an early time, attested in the 9th century as \"segan\".\nOld English hat the corresponding \"sægnan\", which survives as the dialectal (esp. Scottish) \"sain\" (popularized by Scott, \"Heart of Mid-Lothian\" \"God sain us\").\nThe concept of \"Segen\", understood magically, was very productive in the folklore, folk religion and superstition of German-speaking Europe, studied in great detail by the German philologists and folklorists of the 19th century.\n\nThe medieval church used the \"Segen\" (the sign of the cross with a spoken formula) liberally, intended as an act with protective effect, putting the person or thing blessed under the protection of God. Nor was the action reserved for priests or clerics, but any Christian was permitted to make the sign of the cross and invoke the protection of God. Thus the \"Segen\" came to be seen as the inverse of the curse (\"Fluch\"), magical acts with the power to either protect or harm. \nThe concept of \"Segen\" thus became the continuant of the incantation formulas of the pre-Christian period (the only surviving samples of which are the Merseburg Incantations).\n\nUse of such formulas was partly encouraged by the Church, as they did superficially involve an expression of piety by the invocation of God, Christ or the Virgin Mary, but at the same time their magical use was viewed with scepticism and was sometimes repressed.\nBy the time of the Early Modern witch-hunts, the term \"segen\" had become ambiguous, and depending on context could refer to a harmless farewell, to a pious invocation of God, or to a Satanic or superstitious spell (\"pro incantamento et adjuratione magica\" Stieler 1669; e.g. \"Wolfssegen\" \"contra lupos\").\nThis early modern usage survives in dialectal variation throughout the rural parts of German-speaking Europe.\nFor German-speaking Switzerland, the \"Schweizerisches Idiotikon\" 7,444 \"Sëgeⁿ\" \nrecords some two dozen compounds in \"-sëgeⁿ\", in some of which \"Segen\" takes the meaning \"prayer\" and in others \"spell, charm\".\n\nA notable concept in Swiss folklore is the \"Alpsegen\" (\"Alpe(n)sëgeⁿ, Alpsëgeⁿ\" 7,451), a folk religious custom in Alpine Switzerland where every night \na prayer must be sung over each Alpine pasture. This combined the function of an apotropaic charm with a practical aspect of communicating between remote pastures; if the \"Alpsegen\" was not heard from a neighbouring site, it would be a sign that a misfortune or accident had befallen and the neighbours would come to aid.\n"}

Its use in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine dates back to hospitality and holiday customs in ancient Rus. Round korovai is a common element of the bread and salt ceremony.\n\nThe bread has ancient origins, and comes from the pagan belief in the magical properties of grain. Korovai was a large round braided bread, traditionally baked from wheat flour and decorated with symbolic flags and figurines, such as suns, moons, birds, animals, and pine cones. Wheat stalks, herbs, nuts, flowers and fruit were used to embellish the korovai. The bread has no set design, and the style and ornamentation of the korovai varies by region, although colors red, gold and silver were most commonly employed in decoration.\n\nThe bread was traditionally prepared in the home of the bride by women who sang traditional songs to guide them through the making. These women were called the \"korovainytsi\" (pol. \"korowajnice\"), and were most often invited in odd numbers to do the job of making the bread, usually seven.\n\nThe embellishments served a symbolic function. Two birds, made out of dough, represent the couple, and other birds represent family and friends. The entire arrangement is surrounded by a wreath of periwinkle, a symbol of love and purity. The korovai receives blessings before it is placed in the oven for baking.\n\nThe bride and groom were given the korovai as a blessing before the wedding ceremony. The korovai was shared by all the wedding guests, and this was considered the culmination of the wedding. During times of hardship, when a wedding was impossible, the blessing and sharing of bread was often considered enough to constitute a marriage in the eyes of the community.\n\nThe top part of the korovai symbolizes the Moon; it is divided in half and belongs to the marrying couple, the next slice goes to the mother and father of the bride, and so on. In eastern Ukraine, the mother receives a pair of shoes made out of dough, while the father is given an owl, out of those decorating the korovai.\n\nThe bottom section of the korovai called the \"pidoshva\" can be shared with the guests and the band as a symbol of good luck and future prosperity.\n\n"}

They may be components or systems which are intended to operate cooperatively or independently. Software compatibility is a characteristic of software components or systems which can operate satisfactorily together on the same computer, or on different computers linked by a computer network. It is possible that some software components or systems may be compatible in one environment and incompatible in another.\n\nConsider sequential programs of the form:\n\nA particular program might use a printer (resource A) and a file (resource B) in order to print the file.\n\nIf several such programs P1,P2,P3 ... operate at the same time, then the first one to execute will block the others until the resources are released, and the programs will execute in turn. There will be no problem. It makes no difference whether a uni-processor or a multi-processor system is used, as it's the allocation of the resources which determines the order of execution.\n\nNote, however, that programmers are, in general, not constrained to write programs in a particular way, or even if there are guidelines, then some may differ from the guidelines. A variant of the previous program may be:\n\nThe resources A and B are the same as in the previous example – not simply dummy variables, as otherwise the programs are identical.\n\nAs before, if there are several such programs, Q1,Q2,Q3 which run at the same time using resources as before, there will be no problem.\n\nHowever, if several of the Ps are set to run at the same time as several of the Qs, then a deadlock condition can arise.

The incompatibility could be as simple as a change in the order of parameters between the software component requesting service, and the component providing the service. This would be a kind of interface incompatibility. This might be considered a bug, but could be very hard to detect in some systems. Some interface incompatibilities can easily be detected during the build stage, particularly for strongly typed systems, others may be hard to find and may only be detected at run time, while others may be almost impossible to detect without a detailed program analysis.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nA variant of Q, Q<nowiki>'</nowiki> has similar behaviour, with the following differences:\n\nIf P never calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q<nowiki>'</nowiki> instead is a compatible computation.\nHowever if P calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q<nowiki>'</nowiki> instead will lead to a non-terminating computation. \n\nIf we assume further that f(x) has a numeric value, then component Q<nowiki>\"</nowiki> defined as:\n\nmay cause problem behaviour. If P now calls Q<nowiki>\"</nowiki> with = 101, then the results of the computation will be incorrect, but may not cause a program failure. If P calls Q<nowiki>\"</nowiki> with y = 102 then the results are unpredictable, and failure may arise, possibly due to divide by zero or other errors such as arithmetic overflow.\nIf P calls Q<nowiki>\"</nowiki> with y= 103 then in the event that P uses the result in a division operation, then a divide by zero failure may occur.\n\nThis example shows how one program P1 may be always compatible with another Q1, but that there can be constructed other programs Q1' and Q1<nowiki>\"</nowiki> such that P1 and Q' are sometimes incompatible, and P1 and Q1<nowiki>\"</nowiki> are always incompatible.\n\nSometimes programs P and Q can be running on the same computer, and the presence of one will inhibit the performance of the other. This can particularly happen where the computer uses virtual memory. The result may be that disk thrashing occurs, and one or both programs will have significantly reduced performance. This form of incompatibility can occur if P and Q are intended to cooperate, but can also occur if P and Q are completely unrelated but just happen to run at the same time. An example might be if P is a program which produces large output files, which happen to be stored in main memory, and Q is an anti-virus program which scans many files on the hard disk. If a memory cache is used for virtual memory, then it is possible for the two programs to interact adversely and the performance of each will be drastically reduced.\n\nFor some programs P and Q their performance compatibility may depend on the environment in which they are run. They may be substantially incompatible if they are run on a computer with limited main memory, yet it may be possible to run them satisfactorily on a machine with more memory. Some programs may be performance incompatible in almost any environment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14789170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14789170", "title": "Akan chieftaincy", "text": "Akan chieftaincy\n\nIn many parts of West Africa, there is an old chieftaincy tradition, and the Akan people have developed their own hierarchy, which exists alongside the democratic structure of the country. The Akan word for the ruler or one of his various courtiers is \"Nana\" (). In colonial times, Europeans translated it as \"chief\", but that is not an exact equivalent. Other sources speak of \"kings\" which is also not entirely correct, especially in the case of the said courtiers. The term \"chief\" has become common even among modern Ghanaians, though it would be more correct to use the expression \"Nana\" without translation wherever possible.\n\nThe roots of Akan chieftaincy are unknown. Written sources are scarce. When the Akan were settling in the Tekyiman Region, in the period before 1300, they had already long used the chieftaincy system. The paramount chief held a position that can be compared to that of an absolutist king.\n\nWhen the Republic of Ghana was founded in 1957, it was agreed that the chieftaincy system should be respected.\n\nChieftaincy is officially accepted. Politicians ask chiefs for advice because usually they are closer to the people. The highest committee is the National House of Chiefs in Kumasi. There are also Regional Houses of Chiefs. In case of problems between the chiefs, the House of Chiefs has a legal function to adjudicate in such matters.\n\nThe highest rank is that of a paramount chief. Within the Akan ethnic group there are different tribes, such as the Ashanti, Akyem, Kwahu, Akwapim, Assin, or the Fante.\n\nRanked below the paramount chiefs, there are chiefs and sub-chiefs. A sub-chief can be compared to the mayor of a town, except that his office is hereditary as opposed to elective. The chiefs have their own territories, and apart from overseeing them, they have a function at the courts of their paramount chiefs as their ministers. Most of the functions are traditional, while some have been created recently:\n\nA chief arbitrates and decides political and economic questions in his area. When he is installed, he receives a stool name. Usually, all chiefs who belong to a reigning lineage have the same name – an ordinal being added to distinguish between all of them.\n\nThe English translation of the title Omanhene is \"paramount chief\". In rare cases, Queen mothers themselves would be kings, a prime example being Okyenhene Nana Afia Dokuaa. This and the position of Obaatan or Queen mother are the only ones that are obtained through descent from the ruling clan.\n\nThe Krontihene is caretaker of the land and second-in-command after the Omanhene.\n\n\"Ankobea\" means one who stays at home or does not go anywhere. The Ankobeahene is the caretaker of the palace.\n\nObaatan means \"parent\" and is a female role. Her symbol is the egg, out of which all other chiefs came. She is Omanhene's counsellor. When Omanhene's stool is vacant, Obaatan suggests the next incumbent. She is expected to consider all factors such as the character of the available candidates, their royal descent and their contribution to the royal family. Mostly the lineage and order of birth is given a paramount consideration in the selection process.\nAlthough found in other traditions, the position of Obaatan does not fit into the Akan chieftaincy structure proper. The one who suggests and nominates the Omanhene amongst the Akans is the Obaahemaa (or Queen mother).\n\nThe \"warlord\" is the head of all the Asafo companies (or head of the gunners). Tufohene translates loosely in Akan as 'the chief of the gunners', .\n\nThe Asafohene is the head of a single Asafo company.\n\nThe head of the interior.\n\nThe head of the treasury.\n\nThere are four positions describing military flanks. The Adontehene is the one who goes in front of the army.\n\nThe Nkyidom is in the last position. He collects the soldiers who are left behind and sends them back to the army. During Odambea, the Nkyidom always sits in the last palanquin.\n\nThe Nifahene holds the right flank of the army's formation.\n\nThe Benkumhene holds the left flank of the army's formation (also in modern governance known as the left wing).\n\nIf there is anything to distribute or to share, the Akyempimhene (or vice-king) has to do it. He is the first son of the king. He also protects the king, his father, with each king deciding whether to give the title to his literal son or to a close favourite. He also enjoys the authority of arriving in a palanquin after the Asantehene is seated; he alone has that authority to do so. He is also the head of all the Kumasi royals. Otumfuo Opoku Ware (Katakyie) created this title. Usually the first sons of the kings are the ones that ascend this stool. He is also the head of the Kyidom clan (Fekuo). It should be noted here that due to the matrilineal system of inheritance, sons do not automatically succeed their fathers as kings. Kings are by and large selected from among the sons of the deceased king's close female relations. This title is therefore a convenient means of ennobling a king's son without upsetting the royal succession.\n\nThe Mankrado's function is purification. He puts leaves into water, then sprinkles it over the Omanhene. He also always has salt in his pocket so that he can make things taste better for the Omanhene.\n\nThe title of the Guantuahene is a comparatively recent innovation. The Guantoahene is the one to whom people can turn for shelter and mercy.\n\nThe Nsumankwahene watches the oracle. This title is also a relatively recent creation.\nThe Nsumankwahene is a spiritual head of the community/communities. In the past it was chief Priest who performed that role\n\nThe Nkosuohene is responsible for the development of the region. The title is a new one and was adopted from the Ashanti, who had made it up earlier. This title was created to honour someone who does not have to be a member of a royal family. There are some foreigners who have been honoured with this title. It was created to appreciate the contribution of non-royals.\n\nThe most important person in the chief's entourage is the priest or priestess (\"Okomfo\"). Traditionally, the priest tells the chief when it is time to start a war or to marry, for example.\n\nThere is also a stool wife. No matter whether a chief is married or not, when installed, he will be married to a very young girl. Nowadays, it is obligatory, and polygamy is still legal. Today, the symbolic act is sufficient: During parades, a stool wife sits in front of the chief.\n\nA chief has one or more linguists (\"Okyeame\"). A chief never talks in public, but conveys messages through his linguist, who is also responsible for the pouring of libations.\n\nThe title of Queen mother can relate to the rank of a paramount queen, a queen or a sub-queen. The Akan honorific is the same as for the men, \"Nana\". When using English, Ghanaians often say \"queen mother\". This woman is not necessarily the respective chief's mother, although she is usually related to him. Her role in the system is to have an eye on the social conditions, and a personally capable Queen mother has been known to equal or even surpass a reigning chief in terms of power and prestige. A good example of this happening is the case of Queen Yaa Asantewa.\nThe Queen mother (Ohenmaa)suppose to nominate some for the position of the chief incase it become vacant however in some areas it is done by \"Abusuapanyin\" (head of the clan) in consultation with other family members\n\nOn special occasions, chiefs wear the traditional cloth, which is a six-yard-long piece of fabric, wrapped around the body and worn as a toga. Female chiefs wear two pieces of fabric that can be of different designs.\n\nThe jewellery is very ample and used to be made of gold. Nowadays, most chiefs wear imitation gold. The head-dress usually takes the form of a crown. It can be made of metal or of black velvet, ornamented with metal. Chiefs have traditional sandals, and the wearing of sandals is symbolic for them. When a chief abdicates, he takes off his sandals.\n\nWhen riding in a palanquin, chiefs hold a fly-whisk in one hand and a ceremonial sword in the other. The fly-whisk is made of animal hair.\n\nThe ceremonial short sword is used for animal sacrifice. The chief touches the animal's throat symbolically with his sword before someone else cuts it with a sharp knife.\n\nDuring a durbar, which is a special parade, some chiefs are carried in a palanquin. Subchiefs have to walk. The palanquins can have the form of a chair or of a bed.\n\nInstead of a throne, Akan chiefs traditionally sit on a stool. When they die, their stools are painted black and stored in a sacred room.\nThis sacred room is called \"Nkonwafie\" (stool house). If the deceased chief was the first to have sat on that stool, the person's name becomes the first I. Whoever sits on that stool in the future would be called by the first chief's name but would have II attached. The name becomes the new chief's stool name.\n\nVery large umbrellas made of silk and other rich fabrics are used to shade a chief and show from afar that a chief is approaching.\n\nAs there is not much written information, oral sources have to be quoted:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14810479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14810479", "title": "Selah", "text": "Selah\n\nSelah (; , also transliterated as \"selāh\") is a word used 74 times in the Hebrew Bible—seventy-one times in the Psalms and three times in the Book of Habakkuk. The meaning of the word is not known, though various interpretations are given below. (It should not be confused with the Hebrew word \"sela`\" () which means \"rock\", or in an adjectival form, \"like a rock\", i.e.: firm, hard, heavy) It is probably either a liturgico-musical mark or an instruction on the reading of the text, something like \"stop and listen.\" Another proposal is that \"Selah\" can be used to indicate that there is to be a musical interlude at that point in the Psalm. The Amplified Bible translates \"selah\" as \"pause, and think of that.\" It can also be interpreted as a form of underlining in preparation for the next paragraph.\n\nAt least some of the Psalms were sung accompanied by musical instruments and there are references to this in many chapters. Thirty-one of the thirty-nine psalms with the caption \"To the choir-master\" include the word \"selah\". \"Selah\" may indicate a break in the song whose purpose is similar to that of Amen (Hebrew: \"so be it\") in that it stresses the truth and importance of the preceding passage; this interpretation is consistent with the meaning of the Semitic root \"ṣ-l-ḥ\" also reflected in Arabic cognate \"salih\" (variously \"valid\" [in the logical sense of \"truth-preserving\"], \"honest,\" and \"righteous\"). Alternatively, \"selah\" may mean \"forever,\" as it does in some places in the liturgy (notably the second to last blessing of the Amidah). Another interpretation claims that \"selah\" comes from the primary Hebrew root word \"salah\" () which means \"to hang,\" and by implication to measure (weigh).\n\nIts etymology and precise meaning are unknown. This word occurs seventy-one times in thirty-nine of the Psalms and three times in Habakkuk 3: altogether 74 times in the Bible. It is found at the end of Psalms 3, 24, and 46, and in most other cases at the end of a verse, the exceptions being Psalms 55:19, 57:3, and Hab. 3:3, 9, 13.\n\nThe significance of this term was apparently not known even by ancient Biblical commentators. This can be seen by the variety of renderings given to it. The Septuagint, Symmachus, and Theodotion translate διάψαλμα (diapsalma, or \"apart from psalm\") — a word as enigmatic in Greek as is \"selah\" in Hebrew. The Hexapla simply transliterates σελ. Aquila, Jerome, and the Targum translate it as \"always.\" According to Hippolytus (De Lagarde, \"Novæ Psalterii Græci Editionis Specimen\" 10), the Greek term διάψαλμα signified a change in rhythm or melody at the places marked by the term, or a change in thought and theme. Against this explanation Baethgen (\"Psalmen,\" p. 15, 1st ed. Göttingen, 1892) notes that \"selah\" also occurs at the \"end\" of some psalms.\n\nOne proposed meaning is given by assigning it to the root, as an imperative that should not properly have been vocalized, \"Sollah\" (Ewald, \"Kritische Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache,\"p. 554; König, \"Historisch-Kritisches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache,\" ii., part i., p. 539). The meaning of this imperative is given as \"Lift up,\" equivalent to \"loud\" or \"fortissimo,\" a direction to the accompanying musicians to break in at the place marked with crash of cymbals and blare of trumpets, the orchestra playing an interlude while the singers' voices were hushed. The effect, as far as the singer was concerned, was to mark a pause. This significance, too, has been read into the expression or sign, \"selah\" being held to be a variant of \"shelah\" (=\"pause\"). But as the interchange of \"shin\" ש and \"samek\" ס is not usual in Biblical Hebrew, and as the meaning \"pause\" is not held to be applicable in the middle of a verse, or where a pause would interrupt the sequence of thought, this proposition has met with little favor.\n\nGrätz argues that \"selah\" introduces a new paragraph, and also in some instances a quotation (e.g., Psalms 57:8 et seq. from 108:2 et seq.) The fact that the term occurs four times at the end of a Psalm would not weigh against this theory. The Psalms were meant to be read in sequence, and, moreover, many of them are fragments; indeed, Psalm 9 is reckoned one with Psalm 10 in the Septuagint, which omits διάψαλμα (diapsalma) also at the end of Psalms 3, 24, 46 and 68 B. Jacob (l.c.) concludes (1) that since no etymological explanation is possible, \"selah\" signifies a pause in or for the Temple song; and (2) that its meaning was concealed lest the Temple privileges should be obtained by the synagogues or perhaps even by the churches.\n\n\"The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon\" shows that the main derivation of the Hebrew word \"selah\" is found through the fientive verb root סֶ֜לָה which means \"to lift up (voices)\" or \"to exalt,\" and also carries a close connotational relationship to the verb סָלַל, which is similar in meaning: \"to lift up\" or \"to cast up.\" The word סֶלָה, which shifts the accent back to the last syllable of the verb form, indicates that in this context, the verb is being used in the imperative mood as somewhat of a directive to the reader. As such, perhaps the most instructive way to view the use of this word, particularly in the context of the Psalms, would be as the writer's instruction to the reader to pause and exalt the Lord.\n\nGonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson commonly used the word to end articles and personal letters.\n\nJournalist, author and screenwriter George MacDonald Fraser used \"selah\" occasionally in The Flashman Papers, a celebrated historical fiction series published between 1969 and 2005.\n\n\"Selah\" is used in Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can be heard at the end of spoken-word segments of some reggae songs. Its usage here, again, is to accentuate the magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).\n\nFurman Bisher, the former sports editor and columnist for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", for decades signed off his columns with \"Selah.\" The same is often done by political columnist and blogger Ed Kilgore at the close of a day's postings.\n\nIn \"Predator 2\", just before being killed by the predator, the Jamaican drug lord King Willie says, \"His foundation lie in the holy mountain\" before pausing and adding \"Selah.\"\n\nU2 frontman Bono during a Jimmy Kimmel Live performance announced \"Take you to church, Selah,\" right before the choir started singing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ylSoAxpcKk\n\n\"Selah\" is the name of both a sculpture and a 2017 exhibition by artist Sanford Biggers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The cross has three horizontal crossbeams and the lower one is slanted. Nowadays it is a symbol of the Russian Orthodox Church and a distinctive feature of the cultural landscape of Russia. Other names: Byzantine, Russian, Slavonic or Suppedaneum cross.\n\nIt was introduced in the 6th century before the break between Catholic and Orthodox churches. It was used in Byzantine frescoes, arts and crafts. In 1551 during the canonical isolation of the Russian Orthodox Church the Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan the Terrible for the first time in history started to use this cross on the domes of churches. In addition from this time it started to be depicted on Russian state coat of arms and military banners. In the second half of 19th century this cross was promoted by the government of Russian Empire in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a part of Russification politics.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox cross of the Russian origin has only two horizontal crossbeams and the lower one is slanted. Some Russian sources distinguish the Russian Orthodox cross and the Orthodox cross. In Unicode the symbol (☦) is denoted as \"Orthodox cross\". The same USVA headstone emblem is called \"Russian Orthodox cross\".\n\nAccording to many sources the name of the three beam slanted cross is Russian (Orthodox) cross (). \n\nSometimes it is also called Byzantine cross. At the same time the Byzantine cross is also the name for a Latin cross with outwardly spreading ends. It was the most common cruciform in the Byzantine Empire. Other crosses (patriarchal cross, Russian Orthodox cross, etc.) are sometimes misunderstood as \"Byzantine cross\" when they are from the Byzantine culture.\n\nSometimes it is also called just Orthodox cross. At the same time the Orthodox churches use different crosses and any of them is called \"Orthodox cross\". Moreover, there are no such crosses like just \"Orthodox\" or \"Catholic\", each type of cross is a feature of local tradition.\n\nthe cross has three horizontal crossbeams — the top one represents the plate which in the older Greek tradition is inscribed with a phrase based on John's Gospel \"The King of Glory\", but in later images it represents , and the bottom one, a footrest. In many depictions, the side to Christ's right is higher. This is because the footrest slants upward toward the penitent thief St. Dismas, who was (according to Russian tradition) crucified on Jesus' right, and downward toward impenitent thief Gestas. It is also a common perception that the foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ’s right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ’s left. \n\nIn Russia, the top crossbeam can be absent; however, in the Russian North it can be attached on top of the vertical beam.\n\nA variation is a monastic \"Calvary Cross\", in which the cross is situated atop the hill of Calvary, its slopes symbolized by steps. To the viewer's left is the Holy Lance, with which Jesus was wounded in his side, and to the right, a pole topped by a vinegared hyssop sponge. Under Calvary are Adam's skull and bones; the right-arm bone is usually above the left one, and believers fold their arms across their chests in this way during Orthodox communion. Around the cross are abbreviations in Church Slavonic. This type of cross is usually embroidered on a schema-monk's robe.\n\nThe Russian (Orthodox) cross (☦) is traditionally widely used by Russian Orthodox Church. Now it's also widely used by Polish Orthodox Church and Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church, which received their autocephaly from Patriarch of Moscow in 1948 and 1951 respectively. Sometimes this cross is used by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (e.g. in American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese).\n\nThough commonly associated with the Russian Orthodox Church, this version is found also in the Byzantine frescos of churches, which now belong to Greek and Serbian Orthodox churches.\n\nAccording to documentary evidence, the slanted cross with three horizontal crossbeams existed already in the 6th century, long before the Great Schism. However, it was used only in church paintings, arts and crafts, and never on the church domes. There are old frescoes depicting this type of cross on the territory of modern Greece and Serbia.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century this cross started to widely used in Muscovy when its authorities have declared themselves \"Third Rome\" and defenders of the purity of Orthodoxy. In 1551 at the council of canonically isolated Russian Orthodox Church the Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan the Terrible decided to unify the shape of a cross on the Russian church domes to protect Muscovy from the \"Lithuanian, Polack cross\". From this time the Russian Orthodox Cross for the first time in history started to be used on the domes of churches. Between 1577–1625, the Russian Orthodox cross was depicted between the heads of a double-headed eagle in the coat of arms of Russia. It was drawn on military banners until the end of the 17th century.\n\nIn 1654, the Moscow council removed from the liturgical practice of the Russian Orthodox Church the divergence from other Orthodox churches, which were formed during the time of its canonical isolation (1448-1589) as the Russian national features. At this council Patriarch Nikon ordered to use Greek cross instead of Russian Orthodox cross, which, combined with other changes caused Raskol. Replacement of Russian Orthodox cross by Greek cross was caused by disrespectful attitude in Russia to the second one. Soon, however, Russian Orthodox Church began to use the Russian Orthodox cross again. Thus, according to the Metropolitan of Ryazan and Murom Stefan the Russian Orthodox cross was wearing by Peter I (1672-1725), who transformed the Moscow Patriarchate in the Most Holy Synod.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries the Russian Orthodox cross was promoted by the government of Russian Empire and USSR on the territory of modern Belarus, Poland and Ukraine as a part of Russification politics.

It serves as a major precursor to and was reinterpreted by the Hermetic Renaissance magical traditions, particularly the work of Marsilio Ficino.\n\nThe term astrological image first appears in the \"Speculum astronomiae\" and refers to talismans created under specific astrological signs in order to draw down influence from astral spirits (i.e. the planets and stars embodied as the Aristotelian Intelligences, and later the Neoplatonic planetary demons) for magical operation.\n\nImage magic stands in contrast to medieval ritual magic and theurgy, particularly of the Solomonic tradition descending ultimately from the Testament of Solomon. The two competing traditions remained separate in manuscripts until the early Renaissance at which point they were often combined into single codexes.\n\nAs they originated from Arabic sources, image magic was often treated as a natural science manipulating the occult powers of nature rather that the invocation and necromancy associated with Solomonic ritual magic.\n\n"}

The next year, at a meeting with farmers, Morgado and Asagi first barbecued chicken in a teriyaki-like sauce, Morgado's grandmother's recipe. After seeing its popularity, Morgado began cooking huli-huli chicken at fundraisers. Millions of dollars have been raised over the years for charities by selling huli-huli chicken, according to Morgado's stepson. Fundraisers at churches and schools selling huli-huli chicken were common around Hawaii for many years.\n\n\"Huli\" is the Hawaiian word for \"turn.\" As the dish was originally made on a grill with a make-shift spit, onlookers shouted \"huli\" when the chickens were to be rotated, cooking and basting the other side. Morgado, through the Pacific Poultry Company, trademarked \"huli-huli\" in 1967.\n\nMorgado became famous with his huli-huli chicken recipe.

{"id": "14896981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14896981", "title": "Kroeung", "text": "Kroeung\n\nKroeung (, ) is the generic Cambodian word for a number of spice/herb pastes that make up the base flavors of many Khmer dishes. Such dishes are often dubbed with the \"-kroeung\" suffix. Kroeung is traditionally made by finely chopping the ingredients and grinding them together using a heavy mortar and pestle although mechanical food processors can be used in modern kitchens. The resulting paste is similar in form and function to Thai curry pastes. Various ingredients, depending on the dish and the taste of the cook, can be pounded into kroeung. The eight most commonly used are lemongrass, magrut lime zest and leaves, galangal, turmeric, garlic, shallots, dried red chillies and various rhizomes (lesser galangal, \"Boesenbergia rotunda\" (), \"Kaempferia galanga\", etc.).\nThis herbal paste is essential for preparing Khmer dishes in order to create the authentic flavour.\n\nKroeung has two main categories: \"Individual Kroeung\" and \"Royal Kroeung\". Individual Kroeung are dishes which may call for extra ingredients specific to the dish, resulting in a unique-use kroeung. Royal Kroeung on the other hand is fairly standardized. The various types of kroeung can be further distinguished by their colors, specifically, yellow, green and red. The Color Kroeung are commonly used to make stuffings, soup, and stir-fry.\n\nKroeung that are pounded for specific single dishes or have only one unique use falls into this category. Individual Kroeung also consists of extra ingredients not found in its base recipe. \"Somlar Kako\"(សម្លកកូរ), for example, requires roasted ground rice for the smoky flavor of the soup. The Kroeung in Amok(អាម៉ុកត្រី) is considered an Individual Kroeung since it uses the red kroeung base but omits Turmeric in favor of Kaffir lime leaves. Traditionally, kroeung recipes, specifically for curries, requires whole spices to be ground with the herb paste. However, curry powder can also be used in place of the whole spices, in which case the kroeung would also be considered Individual Kroeung.\n\nRoyal Kroeung is based on the kroeung used for royal dishes. The difference between Royal and Individual Kroeung is the extra ingredients sometimes used to make the paste, coriander and Kaffir Lime leaves (instead of zest). Not every Royal Kroeung makes use of the two extra ingredients, but they are the only additions or substitutions in the original recipe.\n\nCambodians living abroad use Kaffir lime leaves instead of Kaffir lime zest, which is actually the whole lime rind that has been sun-dried, as Kaffir limes are not widely available outside of Cambodia, and by extension the South East Asian region.\n\nThere are three distinct color groups into which all kroeung can be categorized: red, green, and yellow. The dominant herb or spice present in the spice-blend paste tints the three different color kroeung. Uncooked kroeung will often change color as it cooks.\n\nThe list of ingredients in these Color Kroeung will vary by recipe, and there are some ingredients included purely for their coloring ability.\n\n\"Kroeung Kraharm\" (), Red Kroeung, receives its deep color from a type of dehydrated chili pod which contributes very little flavor to the kroeung and is added solely for the natural red color, although as the dish is meant to be spicy, hotter chilli peppers may also be used in the spice paste. Lemongrass stalks are used in this paste, rather than lemongrass leaves which would impart a green to the dish when cooked. The lemongrass stalk is a pale beige color, so it easily takes on the dominant red hues from the red peppers. The ingredients of Red Kroeung are:\n\n\nThese ingredients require some advance preparation prior to pounding into this specific kroeung. The dried chili pod must be soaked, seeded, and then drained of excess water.\nThe lemongrass stalks need to be thinly sliced and fresh galangal should be diced. If fresh or brine-soaked turmeric is used, it must be diced as well. Kaffir lime zest must be sliced into thin strips and Kaffir lime leaves require deveining and thinly chopping. The ingredients are then added to the mortar and pounded, usually lime zest/leaves first until smooth, then chili, lemongrass, galangal, and turmeric, until a deep red color is achieved. Lastly, the garlic and shallots are added.\n\nThe usual ingredients for a green kroeung are lemongrass (about a three to one ratio of leaves to stalks), rhizome, cinnamon, galangal and turmeric. Prahok can also be added depending on the dish to be made. A version with prahok, minus the cinnamon, is called \"teuk krueng\" and used as a dipping condiment for fresh or slightly blanched vegetables eaten with rice either as a side dish or as a meal in itself.\n\nThe yellow kroeungs are used often in common everyday dishes, a primary example being the ubiquitous \"samlor machu kroeung\", a stew made with a yellow kroeung base that becomes greenish when cooked, fatty pieces of pork (usually ribs), \"tralach\" (wintermelon), papaya or tamarind for sourness and \"trakuon\" (waterspinach). The primary coloring ingredient for yellow kroeung is turmeric. To this is added lemongrass stalks, garlic, shallot and galangal.\n"}

In Japanese, \"ma\", the word for space, suggests interval. It is best described as a consciousness of place, not in the sense of an enclosed three-dimensional entity, but rather the simultaneous awareness of form and non-form deriving from an intensification of vision.\n\nMa is not something that is created by compositional elements; it takes place in the imagination of the human who experiences these elements. Therefore, ma can be defined as experiential place understood with emphasis on interval.\n\nMa has also been described as \"an emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled\", and as \"the silence between the notes which make the music\" (cf. Isaac Stern's comment below).\nOther illustrations appear in this old poem:\n\n\"Thirty spokes meet in the hub,\"\n\"though the space between them is the essence of the wheel;\"\n\n\"Pots are formed from clay,\"\n\"though the space inside them is the essence of the pot;\"\n\n\"Walls with windows and doors form the house,\"\n\"though the space within them is the essence of the house\".\n\nAmong English loanwords of Japanese origin, both \"Ma (negative space)\" and \"Ken (architecture)\" are written with the same character 間.\n\nThis Japanese \"kanji\" \"Chinese character\" 間 graphically combines 門 \"door\" and 日 \"sun\". The earlier variant character 閒 was written with 月 \"moon\" rather than \"sun\", depicting \"A 門 door through the crevice of which the 月 moonshine peeps in\".\n\nThe diverse Japanese pronunciations of 間 include \"on'yomi\" Sino-Chinese readings (from \"jian\" 間 or 间 \"room; between; gap; interval\") of \"kan\" \"interval; space; between; among; discord; favorable opportunity\" or \"ken\" \"six feet\"; and \"kun'yomi\" native Japanese readings of \"ai\" \"interval; between; medium; crossbred\", \"aida\" or \"awai\" \"space; interval; gap; between; among; midway; on the way; distance; time; period; relationship\", or \"ma\" \"space; room; interval; pause; rest (in music); time; a while; leisure; luck; timing; harmony\".\n\nIn his 2001 book \"The Art of Looking Sideways\", Alan Fletcher discusses the importance of exemplifying \"space\" as a substance:\nDerrick de Kerckhove described Ma as: “the complex network of relationships between people and objects”\n\n\n"}

Some regional variants also add \"gatâ\" (coconut milk), sugar, or even soft drinks to reduce the sourness.\n\nPopular kinds of fish used in \"kinilaw\" include \"tanigue\" or \"tangigue\" (Spanish mackerels, king mackerel, or wahoo), \"malasugi\" (marlins or swordfish), \"tambakol\" (yellowfin tuna), \"bangus\" (milkfish), and anchovies.\n\nVariants predominantly from the northern Philippines use meat (usually called \"kilawin\" to distinguish them from other \"kinilaw\"), including goat meat, beef, carabao, pork, and chicken. Unlike fish \"kinilaw\", meat \"kilawin\" are not eaten raw but are cooked by boiling or grilling or both. They are usually done rare to medium rare, though in some cases the meat are fully cooked. Meat-based \"kilawin\" are also traditionally eaten with \"papaít\" (literally \"bittering agent\"), usually the bile extracted from the gall bladder or by squishing the chewed grass in an animal's stomach.\n\nIngredients used in seafood and meat \"kinilaw\" must be fresh and properly cleaned, as there are health hazards involved with consuming raw seafood and partly cooked meat.\n\nOther ingredients used in \"kinilaw\" include shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin roe, seaweed, jellyfish, shipworms (\"tamilok\") or even beetle larvae (grubs), among others. They vary in terms of preparation, depending on the ingredients, from raw to fully cooked. For example, shrimp are prepared raw, while squid needs to be blanched first to tenderize the flesh.\n\n\"Kinilaw\" also refers to dishes using raw fruits and vegetables marinated in vinegar and spices, in which case the dishes are sometimes referred to by the Spanish term \"ensalada\" (\"salad\"). Examples include cucumbers (\"pepino\"), bitter melons (\"ampalaya\"), young sweet potato (\"camote\") leaves, young papaya, vegetable ferns (\"pako\"), and banana flowers.\n\n\"Kinilaw\" is native to the Philippines. The Balangay archeological excavation site in Butuan (dated c. 10th to 13th century AD) has uncovered remains of halved \"tabon-tabon\" fruits and fish bones cut in a manner suggesting that they were cubed, thus indicating that the cooking process is at least a thousand years old. It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" (1613) as \"cqinicqilao\" and \"cquilao\", a Hispanicized spelling of the Visayan verb \"kilaw\" (\"to eat raw\"), and a cognate of the adjective \"hilaw\" (\"raw\", \"uncooked\", or \"unripe\"). Other sources that mention it include the \"Vocabulario de la lengua Pampanga en romance\" (1732) as \"quilao\"; and in the 1754 edition of \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" as \"quilauin\".\n\nUnlike Latin American ceviches, which exclusively use citrus juices, \"kinilaw\" instead primarily uses vinegar and other acidic fruit juices.\n\nSome of the oldest surviving \"kinilaw\" variants are from the southern Visayas and Northern Mindanao: Cagayan de Oro's \"kinilaw\" (sometimes stylized as \"kinilaw de Oro\") and Dumaguete's \"binakhaw\". Both are direct descendants of ancient Visayan preparation methods as displayed in the Butuan archeological finds. These are the original versions that use \"tabon-tabon\" and \"dungon\" fruits respectively.\n\nSeveral regions of the Philippines have local specialties or names of \"kinilaw\" dishes. In the northern Philippines, the Ivatan people of the Batanes islands refer to \"kinilaw\" as \"lataven\". Ivatan fish \"kinilaw\" is known as \"lataven a among\" (also spelled \"lataven a amung\"). In Ilocos, the Ilocano \"kilawin kalding\" or \"kilawen\" specifically refers to lightly grilled goat meat \"kinilaw\". Among the Kapampangan people of Pampanga, \"quilain\" (also spelled \"kilayen\" or \"kilayin\") or \"quilain babi\" refers to \"kinilaw\" that use fully cooked pork, heart, liver, and tripe. A similar dish among the Caviteño Tagalogs uses fully boiled pork ears, and is known as \"kulao\" or \"kilawin na tainga ng baboy\". When mixed with fried \"tokwa\" (tofu) cubes, \"kulao\" becomes the more familiar dish \"tokwa't baboy\". Modern variants of this dish use soy sauce in addition to the other ingredients.\n\nIn the southern Philippines, the Tausug people of the Sulu islands refer to fish \"kinilaw\" as \"lawal\". Unlike other \"kinilaw\" dishes, \"lawal\" only uses vinegar to wash the fish, and primarily relies on citrus fruits and other souring agents to denature the fish meat. Among the Maranao people of southwestern Mindanao, \"biyaring\" is a type of \"kinilaw\" made with tiny shrimp. It is a regional favorite and is notable because it is ideally prepared while the shrimp are still alive.\n\n"}

Stranahan's was the first modern microdistillery to legally make whiskey in Colorado, and an early craft whiskey distiller in the United States. \n\nStranahan's was founded by Jess Graber and George Stranahan, after whom the whiskey is named, in Colorado in 2004. In 1998, Graber, a volunteer firefighter, met Stranahan, the founder and owner of Flying Dog Brewery, while fighting a fire at Stranahan's barn. They struck up a conversation about whiskey, and were soon in business together. One of the first craft whiskey distillers in the US, Stranahan's is said to have \"kicked off the Colorado distilling craze\" with its whiskey and the designation it invented, Rocky Mountain Whiskey. It was Colorado's first microdistillery, and the state's first legal distillery since Prohibition.\n\nThe first batch of Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey was distilled in 2004 and bottled in 2006. Stranahan's was sold to New Jersey-based Proximo Spirits in 2010, with operations remaining in Colorado. By 2012, Proximo had increased whiskey production from around 12 barrels per week to 30, with plans to grow into the high forties. Stranahan's was sold in 38 states and 7 countries until 2010, when Proximo decided to scale down sales to mostly the Colorado area, maintaining the whiskey's availability in its home state.\n\nSince 2011, Rob Dietrich has served as Stranahan's head distiller, after taking over from original head distiller Jake Norris.\n\nStranahan's is a straight whiskey, aged in new charred oak barrels, like bourbon, with the final whiskey a blend of 2, 3 and 5 year-old whiskeys. It is distilled from a 100% malt barley base grain, with four barleys sourced from the Colorado area, and water sourced from the Eldorado spring outside Boulder. Stranahan's initially used wash from Flying Dog Brewery, before moving to a larger facility and making their own wash beginning in 2009.\n\nEach barrel is bottled by hand, with each label hand-signed by the distiller, often including a note about, for instance, the music listened to during the whiskey's production. The bottling process is done by volunteers, who receive a free tour and a bottle of Stranahan's for their efforts. Volunteers can sign up online on the Stranahan's website - a random lottery picks volunteers from this list for each bottling crew. Current estimates show the waiting list to be 20,000+ people long. The bottle features a metal cap, inspired by the old barroom practice of covering bottles with tin cups when the corks dry out.\n\nOnce a year, Stranahan's creates a limited Snowflake Series, available for purchase only at the Denver distillery, and so called because each batch is unique, like a snowflake. In the Snowflake Series, the standard Stranahan's whiskey is finished in oak casks previously filled with wine from local wineries or other spirits, sitting in the casks for roughly 18 months. When new bottles of Snowflake are set to be released, Stranahan's makes an announcement on their Facebook and Twitter accounts, and people typically camp outside by the distillery the night before the release to secure a bottle.\n\nIn 2012, Stranahan's began collaborating with Colorado's Breckenridge Brewery to create Stranahan's Well Built E.S.B., a Scottish ale-style 7.8% abv beer brewed by Breckenridge and aged in Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey barrels for three months.\n\nStranahan's was featured in \"Whiskey\", an episode of the History Channel's \"Modern Marvels\" that originally aired on March 17, 2008.\n\nStranahan's appears to be the whiskey of choice for character Marty Kaan in the Showtime series \"House of Lies\".\n\nStranahan's is consumed by Morgan Freeman's character \"Monty Wildhorn\" in the 2012 film \"The Magic of Belle Isle\".\n\n\n"}

Founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909, the company began to manufacture its own products in 1912. Originally a family-owned company, Pearson's experienced changes in ownership, acquisitions and product alterations in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, before its most recent sale in November of 2018 to Spell Capital, a Minneapolis private equity firm.\n\nPearson's products are produced on five production lines in the company’s Saint Paul plant. The company sells its Mint Patties, Salted Nut Roll, and Bit-O-Honey nationally and its Nut Goodie and Bun Bars products in several Midwestern states. As of 2018, Pearson's was estimated to be the 42nd largest confectionery company in North America by revenue.\n\nPearson's Candy Company was founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909 by P. Edward Pearson and his brothers, John and Oscar. Two more brothers, Waldemar and C. Fritz, joined the company several years later. By 1935, W. G. Pearson was president of the firm. The five brothers determined manufacturing would be more profitable than distribution and, in 1912, introduced their first confection, the Nut Goodie.\n\nPearson's grew and began manufacturing for other companies, including Whitmans and Planters. Pearson's introduced the Salted Nut Roll in 1933, at the height of The Great Depression. The success of the Salted Nut Roll prompted other manufacturers to mimic the confection. Pearson's subsequently changed the roll's name to the Choo Choo Bar, to distinguish the product. The Choo Choo name, however, was not as successful, and the original name was restored with the Pearson's logo more prominently displayed.\n\nBy the end of World War II, the Pearson brothers had dropped the distribution aspect of the business. The youngest brother, William Pearson, joined the family business in 1944, as did George Pearson, son of founder P. Edward Pearson. In 1951, Pearson's acquired the Trudeau Candy Company, which brought Mint Patties and the Seven Up bar to Pearson's product line. The company moved to a new manufacturing plant at its current address in 1959. In 1962, Pearson’s acquired Milwaukee-based Sperry Candy Company, a company known for its Chicken Dinner Bar. Pearson's, however, sold Sperry Candy to the Schuler Chocolate Factory of Winona, Minnesota five years later.\n\nThe Pearson family sold the company in 1968 to ITT/Continental Baking, a New York firm. ITT/Continental Baking sold the company to an out-of-state confectionery partnership in 1979. During this time, sales declined due to problems with availability and product changes, such as a wrapper redesign and recipe change of the Nut Goodie.\n\nIn 1985, the company was purchased by Larry Hassler and Judith Johnston. The company’s previous owners had split up, causing the bank to offer the company in the leveraged buyout. The Nut Goodie's original wrapper and recipe were restored and, despite the loss of a label contract with General Mills to produce Nature Valley granola bars, which accounted for 1.4 million bars daily and 85 percent of the company's total tonnage, Pearson's became profitable again in December 1992. In early 1998, Pearson's acquired the Bun Bar trademark from Clark Bar America. Pearson's introduced Flurries in 2004.\n\nIn August 2011, Pearson's was acquired by Brynwood Partners IV, who sold their interest in Pearson's Candy to Spell Capital of Minneapolis, in November of 2018.\n\nSalted Nut Rolls are the company's best selling product, and together with Mint Patties account for approximately 80 percent of the company’s sales. Mint Patties are sold nationally and Salted Nut Rolls are available in approximately 60 percent of the company's outlets. In late 2013, Pearson's acquired the Bit-O-Honey brand from Nestle USA, Inc. Although the company sells its products primarily in the United States, it has ranked among the largest confectionery companies in the world, and as of 2018, was estimated to be the 42nd largest confectionery company in North America by revenue.\n\nPearson's utilizes 200 tons of peanuts, 400 tons of sugar, 100 tons of chocolate and 350 tons of corn syrup per month. Products are produced in the company’s plant on five production lines. Current products include:\n\nThe Seven Up Bar was a candy bar comprising seven different chocolate \"pillows\", each filled with a different flavor. Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, brazil nut, buttercream, butterscotch, caramel, cherry, coconut, fudge, mint, nougat and orange. The high manufacturing costs and trademark issues with a soda manufacturer (The American Bottling Company, today Cadbury Schweppes), caused the bar to be retired in 1979.\n\nThe Chicken Dinner Bar had been a product of the Sperry Candy Company, which was acquired by Pearson’s in 1962. The bar, introduced during The Great Depression, was so called in reference to President Herbert Hoover’s promise of “a chicken in every pot”. The bar did not contain chicken or other poultry products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered nut roll. Pearson’s discontinued the bar’s production after the acquisition. Early TV commercials sang \"Chick - Chick - Chick - Chick - Chicken Dinner\" similar to, and in the cadence of a rooster crowing.\n\n\n"}

It is usually made using only chocolate (one-half to two-thirds) and coconut oil (one-third to one-half).\n\nThe reference to ice in the name relates to the fact that it melts very easily in the mouth and is perceived to have a cooling effect as the heat energy is absorbed. This effect is due to the melting point of coconut oil lying between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius, around 10 degrees lower than chocolate. In some recipes, menthol is added, and in industrial production, urea is often added, which both increase the cooling sensation. \nIschoklad is a popular Swedish Christmas treat.

The beverage has antioxidant effects because of the flavonoids.\n\nIts name was taken from the Greek myth of Hesperides.\n\nThis alcoholic drink was invented in 1864 by an American immigrant, Melville Sewell Bagley, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bagley was a native of the state of Maine. He had been involved in the dry goods business in New Orleans before the outbreak of the American Civil War. After the outbreak he emigrated to Buenos Aires where he worked at \"La Estrella\" pharmacy, sited on Defensa and Alsina streets. Bagley started to try with different formulas to create a digestive beverage, using oranges as its main ingredient. The Hesperidina would be born from those tests.\n\nPrior to the official launching of the drink, Bagley made an extensive public campaign with posters spread in the city of Buenos Aires. Those posters only had the word \"Hesperidina\", without images or further explanations about the subject in question.\n\nThe poster campaign lasted three months until Hesperidina was finally launched on December 24, 1864, with an advertisement published in \"La Tribuna\" newspaper. The advertisement stated Hesperidina was a \"stomach digestive, prepared with bitter oranges.\" The immediate success of the apéritif led to the appearance of imitations and other counterfeiting of the product. Alarmed by the situation, Bagley convinced president of Argentina, Nicolás Avellaneda to create a patent and trademark office in order to protect his product. The office was created in 1876, being Hesperidina the first product to register as a trademark in Argentina on October 27. Soon after, Bagley began to print the Hesperidina labels at the New York Bank Note Company to strengthen controls over the product.\n\nDuring the Triple Alliance War (1864–1870) Hesperidina was distributed among the soldiers \"to revitalize the wounded\" because of its therapeutic effects that could solve stomach problems, derived from the non-potable water drank by the combatants.\n\nBeverages, indeed, opened the door to a whole new sector of advertisement driven by the Hesperidina campaign and the arrival to the country of worldwide \"food and beverage\" names such as Real Hollands, Nestlé, Domecq and Bols among others.\n\nThe Hesperidina is mentioned in three short tales by Julio Cortázar: \"Casa Tomada\", \"Tía en Apuros\" and \"Circe\". Another writer, Juan Carlos Casas, also included Hesperidina in his book \"Fraile Muerto\". Hesperidina also appeared in the short tale \"Perdido\" by Haroldo Conti.\n\nTango singer Roberto Goyeneche referred Hesperidina as his favorite beverage, which he used to drink at \"La Sirena\", a bar in Saavedra, Buenos Aires. The Hesperidina also appeared in several calendars painted by Gauchesco artist Florencio Molina Campos. Other famous person that adopted Hesperidina as his favorite drink was explorer Francisco Moreno, who used to drink it during his trips to the harsher regions of the south of Argentina.\n\nFrench musician José de Wravrin (mostly known artistic name, Juan Nirvassed) composed \"Hesperidina: Tango de Moda\" in 1915., which would later won first prize at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina. Hesperidina is also mentioned in the film \"Juan Moreira\" directed by Leonardo Favio in 1973.\n\n\n"}

Certainly, the moist soil, rich in humus, and the climate in the Spreewald also contribute to the good growth in the cucumber fields. The actual reason for the taste, which is considered by connoisseurs to be delicate, is found in their processing. While the process of fermentation in large barrels formerly took several weeks, gherkins today are ready for sale after only one day of processing—whether for mustard gherkins (\"Senfgurke\"), gherkins or dill pickles (\"Gewürzgurke\") or pickled cucumbers (\"Salzgurke\"). This enormous time saving is achieved by heating to with the addition of caustic soda. The composition of the additional ingredients, however, still remains a well-guarded secret of the approximately twenty picklers.

Almost any kind of fruit can be used, like wild strawberry, blueberry, plum and cherry. Traditionally, all guests in Serbian and Bulgarian homes are greeted with a spoonful of \"slatko\" and a cup of water as soon as seated. Particularly honoured guests are offered twice, although any guest can ask for another taste, to honour the housekeeper. For the second taste another spoon must be used. To ask for the third time, if not offered, is regarded as an improper behaviour, although usually granted. Alternatively, in the same manner, the guests may be offered honey (or asked to choose).\n\nSlatko is used as a topping for ice cream and waffle shortcakes, and as a filling in pancakes.\n\nThe most usual types of slatko are those made of whole strawberries, slightly unripe skinned plums or sour cherries. Other fresh fruits like raspberries, sweet cherries, watermelon cubes, rose petals, quinces, grapes, figs, skinned apricot halves or quarters, peaches, blueberries, blackberries or redcurrants can also be used. If a plum slatko is prepared, walnut halves or almonds may be added to the mixture or even inserted into the plums themselves to replace the pits. Some fruits and vegetables (like rhubarb and physalis) rarely grown in Serbia have also been demonstrated to be well suited for slatko. Frozen berries and fruits may be used as well, but the amount of water and the cooking time should be adjusted accordingly.\n"}

They are a kind of pork 'crisps', with fat thermally extracted from the lard.\n\nČvarci are mostly a rustic countryside specialty, common to Serbian cuisine, Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine, continental Croatian cuisine, Ukrainian cuisine and Slovenian cuisine (called 'ocvirki'), though they can also be found in some other countries of throughout Eastern Europe. They are usually homemade, with industrial production not as pronounced. In larger cities they can be obtained on farmer markets or in supermarkets.\n\nPreparation of čvarci involves melting the lard. Lard is cut in blocks of about one inch (2 cm) in size and slowly fried in their own fat. Milk may be added at this point in order to obtain caramel colour. Process lasts until all fat melts away and only a kind of tough crispy pork rind remains. Onion or garlic may be added as a spice and salt is always used as condiment. Pieces of skin may or may not be attached. In most common varieties of čvarci, some percentage of pork fat remains.\n\nA special variety of čvarci known as Duvan Čvarci are mostly produced in the Western Serbia region and especially around the town of Valjevo. In case of duvan čvarci, the process of slow fat frying/cooking is prolonged until all the fat has been extracted. The remainder is a mass of delicate fibers which resembles finely chopped tobacco, thus giving the name to the variety: 'Duvan' is a Serbian word for tobacco.\n\nIndications for 'Duvan čvarci' had been registered and protected in the Serbian intellectual property office by Slavoljub Batoćanin.\n\nA similar process is used to the same effect in Hrvatsko Zagorje, where čvarci are pressed in a potato press to achieve better fat extraction.\n\nAs with most traditional pork products, they are considered to be winter food. Traditional time for pork processing in the Balkans is late autumn, and čvarci are consumed throughout the winter. They can be eaten on their own as a snack, served with heated fruit brandy common to the same region, called rakija, or they can be used as an ingredient in other food recipes (such as proja baked with čvarci). In Croatia, they are most often eaten with bread and onions. If consumed as a snack, they are very often combined with beer.\n\nRecipes with čvarci include various sorts of pastry.\n\n"}

It meant one involved in a poster's production and distribution, not its design: in particular, for producing handbills, setting up type and coordinating flyposting on walls, giving news on local and national events on a range of subjects. Usually anonymous, these people are rarely considered artists, nor their products works of art.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, poster art became a respectable art form, with the invention of large-scale colour lithography. (Chromolithography made its début around 1870.) Artists such as Jules Chéret and Alfons Mucha became famous within the art world, working almost exclusively on advertisements. Almost simultaneously, all Western countries had their own nascent movements: in Britain, the Arts and Crafts movement, and then the Glasgow School of Art (built by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), and in Chicago, where artist William H. Bradley had worked for an advertising agency.\n\nIn France, several famous painters such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec also worked on poster advertising for products or entertainments. Many illustrators also worked in advertising in addition to their work for illustrated newspapers.\n\nAround 1900, posters in the art nouveau style started to appear, notably those by Leonetto Cappiello. The first dedicated street furniture for displaying posters appeared: in particular, the advertising column or \"Morris column\" (), together with large billboards, murals on buildings, and so on.\n\nLittle by little, these new media were considered to be within the realm of the artist and the designer, leading to the notion of the graphic designer as a creator of images and new forms, with a greater understanding of the possibilities of the new graphic forms and the possibilities that the poster gave for expression. It was rare at this time for someone to be known as an \"affichiste\" or \"poster designer\" specifically. The names are still unknown of some prolific poster designers working in the 1910s in Anglo-Saxon countries.\n\nArt Déco and more generally Modern Art, let many poster designers come to greater attention and to express their talents in this medium.\n\nCharles Gesmar, a protégé of Mistinguett since 1916, raised posters to high art, and his posters became enormously famous afterwards.\n\nIn the 1920s, poster art became a cornerstone of graphic art, with works by artists such as Paul Iribe and Cassandre, who established Raymond Savignac. Around this time, photomontage also came to the fore, allowing poster artists to combine photography and typography.\n\nIn the 1950s, techniques of xerography led to a new school of art which came to influence pop art.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Polish artist Roman Cieslewicz brought an important school of \"affichiste\" to the fore, mostly on films, theatre works, and propaganda for the Polish Communist Party) with a nihilism bent, in the context of state censorship. Artists Raymond Hains and Jacques Villeglé, meanwhile, took the name of \"affichistes\" for their photomontage work with collages of torn-up poster fragments. An exhibit of their works in 1957 termed their works (\"Torn Posters\").\n\nIn the last three decades of the twentieth century, techniques of offset printing and digital image processing became more widely used, but these new methods and media led to a great deal of innovation in poster design with new modes of expression.\n\n\n\n"}

It is popular in the Arab world, particularly the Levant and Egypt, Yemen and especially in Palestine. In addition, variants are found in Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans, as well as in the Caucasus.\n\nIn Arabic, \"kanafeh\" (also \"knafeh\", \"kunafa\" or similar spellings) may refer to the string pastry itself, or to the entire dessert dish. In Turkish, the string pastry is known as \"tel kadayıf\", and the cheese-based dessert that uses it as \"künefe\". In the Balkans, the shredded dough is similarly known as \"kadaif\", and in Greece as \"kataifi\", and is the basis of various dishes rolled or layered with it, including dessert pastries with nuts and sweet syrups.\n\nOne of the most well-known preparations of \"kanafeh\" is \"knafeh nabulsiyeh\", which originated in the Palestinian city of Nablus, and is the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. \"Knafeh nabilsiyeh\" uses a white-brine cheese called Nabulsi. It is prepared in a large round shallow dish, the pastry is colored with orange food coloring, and sometimes topped with crushed pistachio nuts.\n\nThe Arabic word \"kunāfah\" () comes from the Coptic Egyptian word \"kenephiten\", a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in \"Alf laylaẗ wa-laylaẗ\", the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of \"side\" or \"wing\", from the Arabic \"kanafa\", to flank or enclose. According to etymologist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word \"tel kadayıfı\" (string-pancake or string-crêpe), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word \"qatayif\" (a pancake or crêpe), and appears at the latest in 1501 in a Turkish-Persian dictionary.\n\nA common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh.\n\nIbn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century \"Kitab al-Tabikh\" (\"Book of Dishes\"), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word \"kunāfah\", nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related \"qatāyif\", meaning crêpes, from which the Turkish word \"kadayıf\" and Greek word \"kataïfi\" derive. In one recipe, \"qatāyif\" are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin crêpes resembling fabric, called \"ruqāq\", cooked on a round sheet of metal called a \"tābaq\", layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar.\n\nThe 13th-century anonymous \"Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus\" (\"Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus\") uses the word \"kunāfa\" to describe a crêpe made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \"mirror\" (the \"tābaq\"), and says it is equivalent to \"ruqāq\". It also gives a recipe for \"Abbasid Qatāyif\" (the crêpes being called \"musahhada\" in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the \"kunāfa\" is made thinner, \"like a fine tissue\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for \"kunāfa\", where the crêpes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater.\n\nIbn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of \"kunāfa\", \"qatā'if\", and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period.\n\nIn the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th-century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's \"Kitab al-Tabikh\" added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this \"kadayif\", though it does not specify where it originated. This became the basis for the modern \"kunafa/kanafeh\". It is fried together with butter and fillings or toppings such as nuts, sweetened cheese, or clotted cream, and mixed with rosewater and sugar. The pastry spread from the Arab lands to neighboring countries including Iran and Greece, and to Turkey where the string pastry itself is known as \"tel kadayıf\" (\"string crêpes\"), also used in related pastries such as \"dolma kadayif\".\n\nThere are many types of Kanafeh pastry:\n\nThe pastry is heated in butter, margarine, palm oil, or traditionally semneh and then spread with soft white cheese, such as Nabulsi cheese, and topped with more pastry. In \"khishnah kanafeh\" the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and a few drops of rose water or orange blossom water is poured on the pastry during the final minutes of cooking. Often the top layer of pastry is tinted with red food coloring (a modern shortcut, instead of baking it for long periods of time). Crushed pistachios are sprinkled on top as a garnish.\n\n\"Kanafeh Nabulsieh\" originated in the Palestinian city of Nablus, hence the name \"Nabulsieh\". Nablus is still renowned for its kanafeh, which consists of mild white cheese and shredded wheat surface, which is covered by sugar syrup. In the Levant and Egypt, this variant of \"kanafeh\" is the most common.\n\nIn the Hatay region of Turkey, which was formerly part of Syria and has a large Arab population, the pastry is called \"künefe\" and the wiry shreds are called \"tel kadayıf\". A semi-soft cheese such as \"Urfa peyniri\" (cheese of Urfa) or \"Hatay peyniri\" (cheese of Hatay), made of raw milk, is used in the filling. In making the \"künefe,\" the \"kadayıf\" is not rolled around the cheese; instead, cheese is put in between two layers of wiry \"kadayıf\". It is cooked in small copper plates, and then served very hot in syrup with clotted cream (\"kaymak\") and topped with pistachios or walnuts. In the Turkish cuisine, there is also yassı kadayıf and ekmek kadayıfı, none of which is made of wiry shreds.\n\nThis type of Azerbaijani variant is prepared in Tabriz, Iran. \"Riştə Xətayi\" consists of meshed shreds, and is typically cooked in Ramadan in the world's biggest covered Bazaar of Tabriz. It is made of chopped walnuts, cinnamon, ginger, powder of rose, sugar, water, rose water and olive oil.\n\nIn this variant, called also (\"kataïfi\") or (\"kadaïfi\") in Greek, the threads are used to make various forms of pastries, such as tubes or birds' nests, often with a filling of chopped nuts as in baklava.\n\nThe world's largest plate of the dessert was made in Antakya, Turkey, in 2017. The tray of \"künefe\" measured 78 meters long, and weighed 1550 kilograms. A previous record attempt was made by rival Nablus in 2009, with a 75-meter tray, weighing 1,350 kilograms. Neither attempt was officially listed as breaking the record; according to the website of the Guinness World Records, there is no current record holder for the title.\n\n"}

The red algae genera are also consumed in Japanese cuisine, where it is known as \"nori\", and in Wales and Ireland, where it is known as laverbread.\n\nAlong with \"miyeok\" (brown seaweed) and \"dasima\" (kelp), \"gim\" is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed types of seaweed in Korea. It is commonly eaten as a \"banchan\" (side dish) and used to make seaweed rice rolls known as gimbap.\n\nThe earliest mention of \"gim\" is recorded in the \"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\"; this text, created during the Goryeo era, documents the history of the Three Kingdoms Period of Korean history between 57 BCE to 668 CE. The book contains passages that say the Silla dynasty would use \"gim\" for part of their dowries. It is conjectured that the \"gim\" of this period was harvested from rocks and driftwood rather than being cultivated.\n\n\"Gim\" cultivation is the oldest aquaculture in Korea and there are several stories from oral tradition about its origins. One version tells the story of an old lady in Hadong, South Gyeongsang Province who discovered a log covered in \"gim\" floating down the Seomjin River. This inspired her to cultivate the \"gim\" on upright support poles made of bamboo. Another legend says \"gim\" was named after Gim Yeoik―the first person to have cultivated \"gim\" after seeing a drifting oak branch covered in it. Yeoik's story takes place on Taein island which is located in the mouth of Seomjin River in Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province, during the reign of King Injo.\n\nProduction of \"gim\" in Jeolla and Gyeongsang Provinces is reported in books from 15th century, including \"Revised and Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea\" and \"Geography of Gyeongsang Province\". In these books, \"gim\" is mentioned as a regional delicacy.\n\nEarly cultivation methods used bamboo or oak sticks. These were eventually replaced by newer methods that utilized nets. The method of using nets was first developed in the 19th century by a fish harvester who was inspired by \"gim\" that grew naturally on fish fences installed in the tidal waters of Wando, South Jeolla Province. \"Gim\" cultivation continued to expand and spread throughout the southern coastlands of Korean Empire (1897‒1910). Floating rafts have been used for mass production since the 1920s.\n\nAround 19,500 tonnes of dried \"gim\" are produced annually in South Korea. Since naturally grown \"gim\" is insufficient to meet market demand, most of the \"gim\" produced for commercial markets is cultivated. \"Pyropia\" is a widely cultivated species.\n\nMany naturally growing \"Porphyra\" species, often clinging to rocks, are collected by hand: \"P. suborbiculata\" can be found along the coasts of the East Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the South Sea; \"P. pseudolinearis\" is found along the coasts of the Sea of Japan (East Sea); \"P. dentata\" along the coasts of Yellow Sea; and \"P. seriata\" grows in the South Sea area.\n\n\"P. yezoensis\" is the most commonly cultivated species of \"gim\", followed by \"P. tenera\". Wando, South Jeolla Province is the main production area for cultivated \"gim\". \"Gim\" cultivation is traditional to the Southern parts Korean peninsula—the Honam, Yeongnam regions, and Jeju Island—as the algae only grow in the oceans around the southern part of Korean Peninsula. However, due to increases in sea temperature, \"gim\" can now be cultivated further north and has spread to the Hoseo region in central South Korea.\n\n\"Gim\" produced during the winter in estuaries or the brackish water zone, with 1.024 ‰ salinity, is said to be the most delicious. Seeding begins in autumn—between September and October—and multiple harvests can be taken from a single seeding throughout the winter months. The algae are known to grow well in sea water when temperatures are between . \"Gim\" that has been grown for 50 days is considered best for consumption, as the color and flavor are at their peak.\n\nTwo main cultivation methods are used in contemporary \"gim\" farming: traditional \"racks\" method used for high quality \"gim\" that is similar to naturally grown laver, and the \"floating rafts\" method used for mass production. Racks type \"gim\", similar in quality to naturally occurring laver, is currently produced in some areas of Wando, Sinan, Gangjin, and Jangheung; however this type of \"gim\" is grown in fewer than 100 farms across the country. The number of farms that use the rack method has been declining due to high production costs, low cultivation yields, increasing water temperatures caused by global warming and aging fishing village populations.\n\nRacks type cultivation starts with planting bamboo sticks in the seabed. Nets, to which the laver seeds can stick, are tied to the bamboo posts. Several nets may be connected together. Seeds are planted on the nets in September, often helped by the process of installing nets in multiple layers to facilitate the clinging of the seeds to the net; the layers of nets are separated and re-installed once the seeds are well attached. The nets are subsequently moved to a farming area. The rack type nets installed at \"gim\" farms are submerged during high tide and exposed to the sun at low tide; this limited exposure to the sun allows for a certain amount of photosynthesis that's helps maintain the original flavor of the \"gim\". Farming \"gim\" using the rack technique is an eco-friendly cultivation method.\n\n\"Gim\" cultivation with floating rafts is the most suitable for mass-production because it is less labor-intensive than rack cultivation. This method keeps the laver submerged in the water during both the high and low tides.\n\n\"Gim\" is known to be abundant in protein, thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamins A, B6, and B12. It is also known to have a high content of mineral salts, particularly iodine and iron, and essential amino acids. It is considered a very healthy food.\n\nWhen eaten as a \"banchan\" (side dish), dried sheets of \"gim\" are toasted with sesame oil or perilla oil, sprinkled with fine salt and cut into squares. It may also be deep-fried to make coated fritters called \"bugak\". For use in \"gimbap\", the sheets are not toasted, but are instead used in their original dried state.\n\n"}

An enoteca is often run in collaboration with growers or growers' or tourism organisations in the village or region. The reason such establishments were named to connote ”wine libraries” was that they were intended as a hands-on source of information on local wines rather than as regular outlets for larger quantities of each wine, or primarily intended for established customers. Often, an enoteca stocks rather small amounts of each wine, and customers who wish to purchase large quantities after tasting are referred directly to the producers. In some cases, an enoteca will also sell other local foodstuff and/or serve small snacks to go with the wines.\n\nA long-standing tradition that precedes the new coinage, is the wine shop in Palazzo Antinori, Florence, where Antinori wines have been available by the glass for more than a century.\n\nEnoteche have spread north of the Alps to Austria under the German name \"Vinothek\" and from Austria to Germany.\n\nBeing associated with an enoteca is likely more beneficial to smaller, not too well-known producers than to large or well-established ones. Casual visitors will have an easier time discovering an enoteca, and the producer will not have to keep an outlet open in his winery just in case someone passes by to purchase a few bottles. On the other hand, having many wines are available side-by-side for tasting, comparison and competition, will be better for well-performing wineries.\n\nBecause of the popularity of the enoteca concept in some locations, \"regular high-end\" wine shops sometimes also call themselves enoteca or \"Vinothek\", without focusing on local wines or catering to visitor's information need. A quality wine shop is most often called enoteca in Italian now. In the past \"Bottiglieria\" was commonly used, but is now falling into disuse and doesn't have the same connotation of quality.\n\nSince some enoteche serve snacks with the wine, enoteca has also been used as the name of some wine bars or restaurants, especially bistro-style restaurants with Italian food.\n\nEnoteca, \"Vinothek\" or \"Oenothèque\" (the corresponding French term) may also be used to denote \"wine libraries\" in two additional meanings of the word:\n\n"}
{"id": "15178198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15178198", "title": "Istishhad", "text": "Istishhad\n\nIstishhad () is the Arabic word for \"martyrdom\", \"death of a martyr\", or \"heroic death\". In recent years the term has been said to \"emphasize... heroism in the act of sacrifice\" rather than \"victimization\", and has \"developed...into a military and political strategy\", often called \"martyrdom operations\". One who martyrs themselves is given the honorific \"shahid\".\n\nMuslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed suicide attacks known as \"Parang-sabil\" against Dutch invaders during the Aceh War. It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it \"Atjèh-moord\", which literally translates to \"Aceh murder\". The Acehnese work of literature, the \"Hikayat Perang Sabil\" provided the background and reasoning for the \"Aceh-mord\" – Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch, The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are Aceh bodoh (Aceh pungo) or Aceh gila (Aceh mord).\n\n\"Atjèh-moord\" was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars' Association ( PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village's religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.\n\nThe original Jawi script Acehnese language work Hikayat Perang Sabil (w:ace:Hikayat Prang Sabi, w:id:Hikayat Prang Sabi) has been transliterated into the Latin alphabet and annotated by Ibrahim Alfian (Teuku.) published in Jakarta. Perang sabi was the Acehnese word for jihad, a holy war and Acehnese language literary works on perang sabi were distributed by Islamic clerics ('ulama) such as Teungku di Tiro to help the resistance against the Dutch in the Aceh War. The recompense awarded by in paradise detailed in Islamic Arabic texts and Dutch atrocities were expounded on in the Hikayat Perang Sabil which was communally read by small cabals of Ulama and Acehnese who swore an oath before going to achieve the desired status of \"martyr\" by launching suicide attacks on the Dutch. Perang sabil was the Malay equivalent to other terms like Jihad, Ghazawat for \"Holy war\", the text was also spelled \"Hikayat perang sabi\". Fiction novels like Sayf Muhammad Isa's \"Sabil: Prahara di Bumi Rencong\" on the war by Aceh against the Dutch include references ro Hikayat Perang Sabil. Mualimbunsu Syam Muhammad wrote the work called \"Motives for Perang Sabil in Nusantara\", \"Motivasi perang sabil di Nusantara: kajian kitab Ramalan Joyoboyo, Dalailul-Khairat, dan Hikayat Perang Sabil\" on Indonesia's history of Islamic holy war (Jihad). Children and women were inspired to do suicide attacks by the Hikayat Perang Sabil against the Dutch. Hikayat Perang Sabil is also known as \"Hikayat Prang Sabi\". Hikayat Perang Sabil is considered as part of 19th century Malay literature. In Dutch occupied Aceh, Hikayat Perang Sabil was confiscated from Sabi's house during a Police raid on September 27, 1917.\n\nIn the Philippines the Moro Muslims are reported to have engaged in suicide attacks against enemies as early as the 16th century. Those who performed suicide attacks were called \"mag-sabil\", and the suicide attacks were known as \"Parang-sabil\". The Spanish called them \"juramentado\". The idea of the juramentado was considered part of jihad in the Moros' Islamic religion. During an attack, a Juramentado would throw himself at his targets and kill them with bladed weapons such as barongs and kris until he himself was killed. The Moros performed juramentado suicide attacks against the Spanish in the Spanish–Moro conflict of the 16th to the 19th centuries, against the Americans in the Moro Rebellion (1899–1913), and against the Japanese in World War II. The Moro Juramentados aimed their attacks specifically against their enemies, and not against non-Muslims in general. They launched suicide attacks on the Japanese, Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not attack the non-Muslim Chinese as the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all the relatives of the attacker.\n\nThe origins of modern Istishhadi attacks lie among the Shia in Iran during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988. Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh, a 13-year-old boy who fought in the war, is said to be the first Muslim to have participated in such an attack in contemporary history. He strapped rocket-propelled grenades to his chest and blew himself up under an Iraqi tank in November 1980. Ayatollah Khomeini declared Fahmideh a national hero and inspiration for further volunteers for martyrdom. Other Iranian basij volunteers ran through minefields to detonate buried landmines and clear a safe battlefield path for following soldiers.\n\nShia usually refer to the martyrdom of Hussain ibn Ali and his companions and family members in the Battle of Karbala as role models and inspiration for martyrdom as a glorious and noble death.\n\nWhen the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas first carried out suicide attacks – involved strapping the body of the mission carrier with explosives – in the Israeli-inhabited towns of Afula and Khidara in the spring of 1994, it \"described these operations as \"`amaliyat istishhadiya\" (martyrdom operations)\" rather than the more secular \"a'maliyat fida'iyah\" (self-sacrifice operations). The term 'amaliyat istishhadiya has caught on and \"today, istishhad is the most frequently used term to refer to acts of sacrifice in the Palestinian resistance and is used by Islamic, secular, and Marxist groups alike\".\n\nAccording to one scholar, Noah Feldman: \"The vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice, the formal videotaped preconfession of faith, the technological tinkering to increase deadliness—all are now instantly recognizable to every Muslim.\" Feldman sees a worrying trend in the steady expansion of the targets of Istishhad since its debut in 1983 when successful bombing of barracks and embassy buildings drove the U.S. military out of Lebanon.\n\nFirst the targets were American soldiers, then mostly Israelis, including women and children. From Lebanon and Israel, the technique of suicide bombing moved to Iraq, where the targets have included mosques and shrines, and the intended victims have mostly been Shiite Iraqis. The newest testing ground is Afghanistan, where both the perpetrators and the targets are orthodox Sunni Muslims. Not long ago, a bombing in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, killed Muslims, including women, who were applying to go on pilgrimage to Mecca. Overall, the trend is definitively in the direction of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. By a conservative accounting, more than three times as many Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombings in the last 3 years as have Israelis in the last 10. Suicide bombing has become the archetype of Muslim violence—not just to frightened Westerners but also to Muslims themselves.\n\nMilitant groups term attacks on military or civilian targets in which the attacker is expected to die, most frequently by detonation of a bomb, as \"martyrdom operations\". The term is usually used by Muslim militants, although non-Muslim groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have also engaged in suicide attacks. Islamist militants prefer the term \"martyrdom operation\" to \"suicide attack\", as suicide is forbidden under classical Islamic law. While combat inherently involves a risk of death, a \"martyrdom operation\" implies a deliberate act leading to death as part of the attack.\n\nActs of istishhad are governed by Islamic legal rules associated with armed warfare or military jihad. The rules governing jihad, literally meaning struggle but often called \"holy war\" by non-Muslims, are covered in exquisite detail in the classical texts of Islamic jurisprudence. In orthodox Islamic law, jihad is a collective religious obligation on the Muslim community, when the community is endangered or Muslims are subjected to oppression and subjugation. The rules governing such conflicts include not killing women, children or non-combatants, and leaving cultivated or residential areas undamaged.\n\nFor more than a millennium, these tenets were accepted by Sunnis and Shiites; however, since the 1980s militant Islamists have challenged the traditional Islamic rules of warfare in an attempt to justify suicide attacks despite clear contradictions to established Islamic laws.\n\nSome Western and Muslim scholars of Islam find suicide attacks to be a clear violation of classical Islamic law. Nevertheless, the militant groups that carry out \"martyrdom operations\" believe that their actions fulfill the obligation of jihad, and some clerics support this view.\n\nSuicide bombings as acts of terrorism have spurred some Muslims to provide scholastic refutations of suicide bombings and to condemn them. For example, Ihsanic Intelligence, a London-based Islamic think tank, published a study on suicide bombings that concluded, \"suicide bombing is anathema, antithetical and abhorrent to Sunni Islam. It is considered legally forbidden, constituting a reprehensible innovation in the Islamic tradition, morally an enormity of sin combining suicide and murder and theologically an act which has consequences of eternal damnation\".\n\nOxford-based Malaysian jurist Shaykh Afifi al-Akiti, issued his fatwa forbidding suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians: \"If the attack involves a bomb placed on the body or placed so close to the bomber that when the bomber detonates it the bomber is certain [yaqin] to die, then the More Correct Position according to us is that it does constitute suicide. This is because the bomber, being also the Maqtul [the one killed], is unquestionably the same Qatil [the immediate/active agent that kills] = Qatil Nafsahu [killing oneself, i.e., suicide].\"\n\nIn January 2006, a Shiite marja cleric, Ayatollah al-Udhma Yousof al-Sanei decreed a fatwa against suicide bombing declaring it as a \"terrorist act\" and the Saudi grand mufti as well as other Sunni scholars similarly denounced suicide attacks regardless of their offensive or defensive characterization.\n\nScholar Bernard Lewis states, \"At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays\". Similarly, Noah Feldman writes that the Islamic reasoning of suicide attackers is not convincing as martyrdom in Islam typically refers to another person killing a Muslim warrior, not the warrior pushing \"the button himself\". In addition, \"The killing of women and children has proved harder to explain away as a permissible exercise of jihad.\" This \"illustrates the nature of the difficulty of reconciling suicide bombing with Islamic law\".\n\nAs Charles Kimball, the University of Oklahoma's Director of Religious Studies, pointed out that Islam \"clearly prohibits suicide\" by citing \"the hadith materials, which are the authoritative sayings and actions of the prophet, Muhammad, includes many unambiguous statements about suicide: one who 'throws himself off a mountain' or 'drinks poison' or 'kills himself with a sharp instrument' will be in the fire of Hell. Suicide is not allowed even to those in extreme conditions such as painful illness or a serious wound\". Other Islamic groups such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research cite the Quran'ic verse Al-An'am 6:151 as a prohibition against suicide: \"And take not life, which Allah has made sacred, except by way of justice and law\". Dr. Hassan Ali El-Najjar says that the \"hadith\" unambiguously forbid suicide.\n\nIslamist militant organisations (including Al-Qaeda, ISIL, Hamas and Islamic Jihad) continue to argue that suicide operations are justified according to Islamic law, despite Islam's strict prohibition of suicide and murder. Irshad Manji, in a conversation with one leader of Islamic Jihad noted their ideology.\n\n\"What's the difference between suicide, which the Koran condemns, and martyrdom?\" I asked. \"Suicide,\" he replied, \"is done out of despair. But remember: most of our martyrs today were very successful in their earthly lives.\" In short, there was a future to live for—and they detonated it anyway.\n\nAnother rationale provided for why istishhad is not against Islamic law is that the civilians caught in the crossfire \"were destined to die\". The Saudi exile Muhammad al-Massari explains that any civilian killed in an attack on the enemy \"won't suffer [but instead]…becomes a martyr himself\". During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah apologized for an attack on Nazareth that killed two Israeli-Arab children—but said the two children should be considered \"martyrs\".\n\nFurther justifications have been given by Iranian cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, \"when protecting Islam and the Muslim community depends on martyrdom operations, it not only is allowed, but even is an obligation as many of the Shi'ah great scholars and Maraje', including Ayatullah Safi Golpayegani and Ayatullah Fazel Lankarani, have clearly announced in their fatwas\". Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran showered those who performed martyrdom operations during the Iran–Iraq War and against Israel with accolades. Indeed, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, the second Secretary General of Hezbollah and student of Khomeini, created a supplication that became popular among the Hezbollah youths and fighters.\n\nOther clerics have supported suicide attacks largely in connection with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Sunni cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi has supported such attacks by Palestinians in perceived defense of their homeland as heroic and an act of resistance. Shiite Lebanese cleric Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual authority recognized by Hezbollah, is reported to have similar views.\n\nAfter the 7 July 2005 London bombings, journalist Mona Eltahawy published an op-ed in the \"Washington Post\" noting the fact that there were \"22 imams and scholars who met at London's largest mosque to condemn the bombings but who would not criticize all suicide attacks\", such as Sayed Mohammed Musawi, the head of the World Islamic League, who said \"there should be a clear distinction between the suicide bombing of those who are trying to defend themselves from occupiers, which is something different from those who kill civilians, which is a big crime\". After the knighting of Salman Rushdie in June 2007, Pakistan's acting Minister of Religious Affairs Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq publicly justified and called for a suicide attack against him.\nThere have been conflicting reports about the stances of Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy (who was then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar- he is now deceased) and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb (who was then the Grand Mufti of Egypt and is now the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar). Shortly after the September 11 attacks Sheikh Tantawy issued a statement opposing suicide attacks. However, a translation from Al Azhar website quotes him as supporting suicide attacks on Jews in Israel as part of the Palestinian struggle \"to strike horror into the hearts of the enemies of Islam\". Yet, in 2003 he was quoted again as saying \"groups which carried out suicide bombings were the enemies of Islam\", and that all suicide attacks were sinful including those against Israelis. His comments condemning all suicide attacks were echoed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Lebanese cleric Husam Qaraqirah.\n\nIn addition to the views of Muslim theologians, conflicting viewpoints are apparent among the public in Muslim-majority countries. As a reporter for \"The Guardian\" notes in an article written during the second intifada in August 2001, the Muslim world celebrates \"martyr-bombers\" as heroes defending the things held sacred. Polls in the Middle East in August 2001 showed that 75% of people had been in favor of martyr-bombings.\n\nHowever, the Pew Research Center has found decreases in Muslim support for suicide attacks. In 2011 surveys, less than 15% of Pakistanis, Jordanians, Turks, and Indonesians thought that suicide bombings were sometimes/often justified. Approximately 28% of Egyptians and 35% of Lebanese felt that suicide bombings were sometimes/often justified. However, 68% of Palestinians reported that suicide attacks were sometimes/often justified. In 2013, Pew found that \"clear majorities of Muslims oppose violence in the name of Islam\"; 89% in Pakistan, 81% in Indonesia, 78% in Nigeria, and 77% in Tunisia said that \"suicide bombings or other acts of violence that target civilians are never justified\".\n\n\n"}

The term goes back to the plantation days when the home owners would buy houses designed to move from one property to another. The word \"chattel\" means movable property so the name was appropriate. Chattel houses are set on blocks or a groundsill rather than being anchored into the ground. In addition, they are built entirely out of wood and assembled without nails. This allowed them to be disassembled (along with the blocks) and moved from place to place. This system was necessary historically because home \"owners\" typically did not own the land that their house was set on. Instead, their employer often owned the land. In case of a landlord tenant (or employer/employee) dispute, the house could be quickly moved to a new property.\n\nIt has been customary for people in Barbados to build additions onto their chattel houses. As such, the house may look as though different sections are at slightly different heights or in a different pattern due to each part being constructed at different stages.\n\nModern chattel houses tend to have a greater degree of permanence, as they are often connected to the electricity mains, and may either have a permanent septic tank or be connected to a public sewer system.\n\nTimbers were in pre-cut in standard lengths of 12 to 20 feet (even numbers). The front façades tend to be symmetrical, with the door in centre flanked by a window (equally spaced), on each side. As the financial situation changed additions would be made. \nThe roofs were often made of corrugated metal made of iron.\nAs the dimensions changed the style of roofs also changed. These earlier styles gave way to the four-sided roof called the 'hip'. or the steep two-sided gable'. Since then many homes have also transitioned to a more 'flat top' roof with a minimal slope.\n\nAlthough the term is strongly associated with Barbados, it is also used as a legal term in other countries including Trinidad (e.g. CHAPTER 59:54 LAND TENANTS ACT and Maharaj v. Constance 1981), the British Virgin Islands (see section 6(3) of the Small Tenements Act (Cap 73)), and other islands.\n\nChattel houses are still in use on several West Indian islands, although they have become much less common in areas still affected by seasonal hurricanes (Barbados and Trinidad lie outside of the Caribbean hurricane belt).\n\n\n"}

Burford is the first Republican to represent DeSoto Parish in the state legislature since Reconstruction. \n\nIn 2015, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Louisiana State Senate in District 38 to succeed the term-limited Republican Sherri Smith Cheek Buffington. A second Republican defeated in the Senate race was the conservative Cloyce Clark, who had vowed \"New Conservative Leadership\" had he been elected.\n\nPrior to his legislative service, which began on January 14, 2008, Burford was one of eleven members of the DeSoto Parish Police Jury (the parish governing council), having represented District 3 since 1996. He is a member of the DeSoto Parish Chamber of Commerce.\nAs a legislator, Burford pledged to support Blueprint Louisiana, a group which proposes reforms in the way Louisiana conducts its state government and promotes high technology and economic development. It is chaired by former State Representative Sean Reilly, an officer of Lamar Advertising Company in Baton Rouge.\n\nIn the general election held on November 17, 2007, Burford defeated Democrat Kenny Ray Cox of Mansfield, 4,993 (63 percent) to 2,990 (37 percent) to win the House seat. In October 20 jungle primary, Burford and Cox led three other candidates, Republican Dennis Freeman, the since deceased mayor of Logansport in DeSoto Parish, and Democrats Hilda Fair Rives and John G. Russell, a bank executive. Burford succeeded term-limited Democrat Beverly G. Bruce, who was first elected in District 7 in 1995, when she defeated the Republican Tommy Gene Armstrong, 7,027 (53 percent) to 62,35 (47 percent). Bruce ran without opposition in both 1999 and 2003.\nIn an interview with the \"Shreveport Times\", Burford cited ethics as among his legislative priorities: \"I am certainly interested in seeing a good ethics package passed [and] the completion of Interstate 49 [and] Highway 3276, a connector between U.S. Highway 171 and I-49 in the Stonewall area.

In 2012, he was rated 100 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 90 and 100 percent, respectively. Louisiana Right to Life has scored him 100 percent for every year that he has been a legislator.

Calcium alginate is also used for entrapment of enzymes and forming artificial seeds in plant tissue culture.\n\n\"Alginate\" is usually the salts of alginic acid, but it can also refer to derivatives of alginic acid and alginic acid itself; in some publications the term \"algin\" is used instead of alginate. Alginate is present in the cell walls of brown algae, as the calcium, magnesium and sodium salts of alginic acid.\n\nTo extract the alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred with a hot solution of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over a period of about two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away from the surface of the filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.\n\nThe goal of the extraction process is to obtain dry, powdered, sodium alginate. The calcium and magnesium salts do not dissolve in water; the sodium salt does. The rationale behind the extraction of alginate from the seaweed is to convert all the alginate salts to the sodium salt, dissolve this in water, and remove the seaweed residue by filtration. The alginate must then be recovered from the aqueous solution. The solution is very dilute and evaporation of the water is not economic. To the sodium alginate from the initial extraction solution, a calcium salt is added. This causes calcium alginate to form with a fibrous texture; it does not dissolve in water and can be separated from it with relative ease using a metal screen.\n\nUses of calcium alginate are:\n"}

Viennese cuisine is often treated as equivalent to Austrian cuisine, but while elements of Viennese cuisine have spread throughout Austria, other Austrian regions have their own unique variations. Viennese cuisine is best known for its pastries, but it includes a wide range of other unique dishes. \n\nVienna has been the capital of Austria for more than a thousand years. It became the cultural centre of the nation and developed its own regional cuisine; as such, Viennese cuisine bears the unique distinction of being the only kind of cooking named after a city.\n\nThe variety of ingredients sold on the Naschmarkt might lead to the thought of a broadly varied cooking culture. In fact, dishes heavily depending on meat make up typical Viennese cuisine: Wiener schnitzel (veal coated in breadcrumbs and fried), Tafelspitz (boiled beef), Beuschel (a ragout containing veal lungs and heart), and Selchfleisch (smoked meat) with sauerkraut and dumplings are typical of its cooking.\n\nSome sweet Viennese dishes include Apfelstrudel (strudel pastry filled with apples), Millirahmstrudel (milk-cream strudel), Kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancakes served with fruit compotes), and Sachertorte (cake of two layers of chocolate cake with apricot jam in the middle). These and many other desserts will be on offer at one of the many Konditorei of Vienna, where they are generally eaten with coffee in the afternoon.\n\nLiptauer as a spread, or Powidl also as spread or base for dumplings are also quite popular.\n\nThe Viennese cooking tradition developed from many different sources. Italian influence has been strong since roughly the early 17th Century. In the 18th Century, French cuisine became influential in Vienna, along with French etiquette and diplomatic language. The term \"Wiener Küche\" (Viennese cuisine) first appeared in German language cookbooks around the end of the 18th century, and it was mistakenly treated as equivalent to Austrian cuisine. In the second half of the 19th Century, cookbooks started to include Bohemian, Hungarian (particularly with Gulaschsuppe, originally a Hungarian stew), Italian, Jewish, Polish and Southern Slavic features in Viennese cuisine. The croissant is also thought to have originated in Vienna after the defeat of the Turks in the Siege of Vienna.\n\nIn modern Vienna, many chefs have begun to combine traditional Viennese dishes with the principles of nouvelle cuisine to create what is known as \"Neue Wiener Küche\" (\"New Viennese cuisine\"). Also, Turkish, Jewish, Middle Eastern, and Indian cuisine have influence on the city because of growing immigrant communities.\n\nTypical Viennese dishes include:\n\n\nThe Danish pastry is said to originate from Vienna and in Denmark is called \"wienerbrød\" (Viennese bread), probably because it uses a certain kind of dough consisting of butter and flour in the classic cuisine referred to as \"Viennese Dough\". This pastry is called \"Kolatsche\" (from the Czech \"koláč\") in Viennese.\n\n"}

However, the term is also occasionally applied to the peel, root, or even entire fruit or vegetable like parsley, fennel and cucurbita which have a bitter taste and are boiled with sugar to get a special \"sweet and sour\" outcome.\n\nFruits which are commonly candied also include dates, cherries, pineapple, ginger, and the rind of watermelon.\n\nThe word succade is most probably derived from the Latin \"succidus\", but according to others the name may have originated from the Hebrew word sukkah, the temporary booth that Jews build on the holiday of Sukkot. The citron, known in Hebrew as an \"etrog\", is one of the symbolic Four Species used on that holiday. After Sukkot, some Jews candy the \"etrog\" or make marmalade from it.\n\nWhile the word \"Succade\" was widely used in German, today it is usually called \"Zitronat\". The French called it \" fruit glacé \" or \" fruit confit \", and is also known as \"candied fruit\" or \"crystallized fruit\". It has been around since the 14th century.\n\nThe \"citron\" fruits are halved, depulped, immersed in seawater or ordinary salt water to ferment for about 40 days, the brine being changed every two weeks; rinsed, and put in denser brine in wooden barrels for storage and for export. After partial de-salting and boiling to soften the peel, it is candied in a strong sugar solution. The candied peel is sun-dried or put up in jars for future use. Candying is traditionally done in Livorno, Italy, where they gathered the Corsican citrons from Corsica, the Diamante citrons from Liguria, Naples, Calabria and Sicily, and the Greek citron from Greece through Trieste.\n\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, thereby preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms.\n\nIn the Eastern Bloc, ersatz succade and orangeat were prepared from unripe tomatoes and carrots respectively, as citrus fruits were scarce goods that could not be produced domestically.\n\nSuccade is sometimes used in cakes, as a filling for pound cake, oliebol, plum pudding, florentines, sfogliatelle, fruitcake or ontbijtkoek. It is also added to raisin bread. Succade is often combined with currants, raisins, cherries and hazelnuts. Candied citron peel is often coated in chocolate and eaten as confectionery. Chopped succade is also used in cannoli.\nRecipes vary from region to region, but the general principle is to boil the fruit, steep it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks, and then dry off any remaining water.\n\nThe high sugar content of finished glacé fruits inhibits the growth of microorganisms, and glacé fruits will keep for a number of years without any additional methods of preservation.\n\nFruits that hold up well to being preserved in this manner include cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, pears, starfruit, pineapple, apples, oranges, lemons, limes and clementines. Angelica is rarely seen in Western cooking except as a glacé fruit.\n\n\n"}

It is Scottish in origin, originally eaten on Twelfth Night but now enjoyed at Hogmanay. The cake mixture typically contains raisins, currants, almonds, citrus peel, allspice, ginger, cinnamon and black pepper. It had originally been introduced following the return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France, but its original use at Twelfth Night ended with the Scottish Reformation. It was subsequently used for first-footing over Hogmanay.\n\nBlack bun is a fruit cake wrapped in pastry. The cake itself is similar to a traditional Christmas cake or Christmas pudding mixture, including ingredients such as raisins and currants along with spices such as cinnamon, black pepper and allspice. It has been called a much bigger version of a Garibaldi biscuit, and it has been suggested that the origin of that biscuit may have been influenced by the black bun because the inventor of the biscuit, John Carr, was Scottish.\n\nOutside Scotland, the black bun is also eaten in the Appalachia region of the United States. In 2013, a recipe was demonstrated by Paul Hollywood on a Christmas special of \"The Great British Bake Off\".\n\nThe cake was originated as a Scottish King cake for use on Twelfth Night on 5 January – the eve of Epiphany, and the end of the Twelve Days of Christmas. It was introduced following the return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France, and the tradition was that a bean was hidden in the cake – whoever found it became the King for the evening. It has been recorded that Mary herself participated in such games, and in 1563 she dressed her childhood companion Mary Fleming in royal robes and jewellery after Fleming became Queen for the evening. This shocked the English Ambassador, who wrote \"The Queen of the Bean was that day in a gown of cloth of silver, her head, her neck, her shoulders, the rest of her whole body, so beset with stones, that more in our whole jewel house was not to be found.\" Following the Scottish Reformation in 1560, the celebration of Christmas was outlawed in Scotland and the use of a King cake at that time ended.\n\nThe black bun type of cake in its modern usage dates from the early nineteenth century, previously called Scotch bun and Scotch Christmas bun. The term \"black bun\" was first recorded in 1898, and may have been a result of Robert Louis Stevenson referring to the cake as \"a black substance inimical to life\".\n\nThe cake is now commonly used as a Hogmanay custom, where people visit their neighbours after midnight to celebrate the New Year. This is called first-foot, and the gift of a black bun was meant to symbolise that the receiving family would not go hungry during the forthcoming year. It was also used a traditional cake to serve to those visiting homes as part of Hogmanay, to be consumed with whisky.\n\n"}

According to scholars of Paraguayan social history, the popular Paraguayan diet evolved as a result of the Paraguayan War in the nineteenth century. In the aftermath of the war, food supplies were hard to find. As a result, Paraguayan cooking developed highly nutritious meals to make up for the scarcity of everyday meals.\n\nThe name \"mbejú\" (also written \"mbeyú\") means \"cake\" and comes from the Guarani language. Guarani is one of the two official languages of Paraguay, which defines itself as being bilingual and multi-cultural. The mbejú is bound to the Guarani mythology to be one of the most ancient recipes of this culture. Traditionally, there were about 16 ways to prepare it, although nowadays, 11 are recognized. Next to the chipá and the sopa paraguaya it is part of the so-called \"tyra\", a Guarani term for food consumed to accompany the \"mate cocido\", milk or coffee, or simply an addition to other dishes.\n\nTraditional mbejú require starch, corn flour, pork fat, thin salt, fresh cheese and milk. The variety called \"mbejú avevo\" (\"inflated cake\") uses the same ingredients but with the pork fat, the eggs and the cheese in larger quantities. Another variant, \"mbejú de fariña\" substitutes manioc flour for starch.\n\nThere are other recipes for the Mbeju, Mbeju cuatro quesos for example which means mbeju with extra cheese, that requires 250 grams of cassava starch, 75 grams of butter, 150 grams of Paraguayan cheese, 2 spoonful of milk, salt, 2 tomatoes perita,100 grams of cuartirolo cheese, 50 grams catupyry cheese, oregano, basil leaves, and black pepper.\n\nThe starch is sifted.

A layer of the mixture of about 1½ centimeters is put into the pan, squeezing the borders with the back of a spoon. It is cooked for a few minutes, moving the pan so it cooks evenly without burning the center.

Its taste is considered delicious by many and is often served in “asados” (social meetings where diverse cuts of grilled cow meat, pork and sausages are eaten, the Paraguayan version of the American barbecue).\n\nLike every meal of Paraguayan gastronomy, and also Northeastern Argentina, it contains, for reasons that are historically refuted, a high value in calories.\n\nThe “chipa guasu” owes its name to the conjunction of two words. The first, “chipa” refers generically to a diverse group of cakes that has corn as a base for its preparation and that is part of the “Tyra”, a Guaraní term that names every food consumed to accompany the \"mate cocido\", milk or coffee, or prepared just to be an addition to other dishes. The second word that intervenes in the composition of the name, “guasu”, means “big” by which it can be inferred that “chipa guasu”, is the biggest of all “chipas”.\n\nIn the preparation of “chipa guasu” are used: medium size onions, water, salt, eggs, Paraguay cheese (a very fresh cheese), Criollo cheese or Mar del Plata cheese, milk, and corn grains.\n\nChopped onions, water and salt, are boiled in a pot for about 10 minutes, and then let cool down. The pork fat is whipped until it turns creamy and a much lighter color, then the eggs are added one by one along pieces of fresh cheese, all without stop whipping. The boiled onions are added to this creamy preparation, and also the grains of corn (that have been previously mollified) and the milk.\n\nMix all together and the result is a paste that is put in a buttered or floured oven tray.\n\nIt’s cooked in the oven, at low heat (around 200°C) for about an hour and a half.\n\nA variant of “chipa guasu” may not contain eggs, in which case it requires more milk.\n\n“Chipa guasu” is prepared similar to sopa paraguaya, substituting corn grains for corn flour.\n\nAccording to some scholars in Paraguay, Paraguayan popular gastronomy established itself as a small family industry after the Paraguayan War, fought between 1864 and 1870 between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance composed of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Its high caloric content owes to the scarcity of food that plagued the country during and after the conflict. Basic foodstuffs were limited and groceries almost nonexistent, leading to hearty meals intended to provide a full day's nourishment. \n\n\n"}

They were formerly often made in the form of rings or rolls.\n\nJumbles were known by many variations on the basic name, including jambal, jemelloe, and gemmel. They were widespread, specifically because they travelled well, thanks to their very dense, hard nature. They could be stored for up to a year without becoming too stale. Because of their density, they were sometimes twisted into knots before baking, in order to make them easier to eat, generating knots as another common name.\n\nJumbals were traditionally shaped in intricate loop or knot patterns, usually of rolled out dough. Early flavouring agents were aniseed, coriander, caraway seeds and rosewater. Later, especially in the United States, jumbles referred to a thin crisp cake or cookie using lemon-peel as a flavoring agent.\n\nIn Australia, Arnotts manufactures a related product called \"Honey Jumbles\".\n\nJumbles were widespread in Europe by the 17th century, but possibly originated in Italy as the cimabetta. A very common cookie for travelers, they were probably brought to America on the Mayflower, if not Jamestown previously. There is even a famous recipe for this type of cookie that is credited to Martha Washington.\n\nOriginally, jumbles were twisted into various pretzel-like shapes and boiled. By the late 18th century, jumbles became rolled cookies that were baked, producing a cookie very similar to a modern sugar cookie, although without the baking powder or other leavening agents used in modern recipes.\n\nThe word \"jumble\" is derived from the French \"jumelle\", meaning \"twin\", because of their shape.\n\n"}

The jelling property of the seeds was discovered by the businessman as he drank from a creek in Chiayi. He found a clear yellowish jelly in the water he was drinking and was refreshed upon trying it.

After several minutes of massaging and washing, no more of the yellowish tea-coloured gel will be extracted, and the contents of the bag are discarded. The washed gel is then allowed to set into a jelly either in a cool location or in the refrigerator. One must keep in mind certain things when making aiyu jelly or else the gel may not set:\nWater will slowly seep out of the jelly some time after it sets, and it will turn back to a liquid over the course of several days.\n\nThe jelly is usually served with honey and lemon juice but can also be included in other sweetened beverages or shaved ice and is particularly popular as a cool drink in hot summers.

In Bilbao and Donostia it is an essential element at \"Saint Thomas\"' fair, celebrated annually on December 21. In the 1930s, workers would wrap foods within talo and take this to the fields. During the 1930s, miners also consumed talo, and it was also eaten by factory workers after this time.\n\nNowadays it is eaten with txistorra (a type of thin chorizo) while drinking txakoli. It is sometimes accompanied with milk, eaten with fried egg, fried pancetta (in Basque \"xingar\", in French \"Ventrêche\") or fried Bayonne Ham, cheese like Ossau-Iraty, chocolate or honey. In Bayonne, France, street vendors purvey talo during its annual Bayonne Ham Fair.\n\n\n"}

It is made from ordinary non-glutinous rice, and it is generally sold fresh rather than dried.\n\nThe processing of mixian in Yunnan is unique, involving a fermentation process. In many areas there are at least two distinct thicknesses produced, a thinner form (roughly 1.5mm diameter) and a thicker form (roughly 3.5-4mm diameter).\n\nMixian is served in various ways, either in broth or stir-fried.\n\nStir-fried preparation is rapid, most common in the evening, and is popular at road-side BBQ stands throughout Yunnan. Egg, tomato, meat, spring onion and chilli are frequently utilized.\n\nThe most famous prepared dish is \"guoqiao mixian\" (過橋米線/过桥米线; literally \"crossing the bridge noodles\").\n\nMore normally, when \"mixian\" is served in broth in Yunnanese restaurants, it is an extremely popular breakfast and day-time dish. Broths are generally chicken or beef, though others exist.\n\nIt is common for a range of individual condiments to be presented for the customer to add to their bowl themselves. Usually the noodles are first added to the broth (see copper pot image on the right), but sometimes the customer is presented the noodles in a separate bowl (see condiment image, below). In this latter case, condiments are generally added directly to the broth prior to adding the noodles.\n\nMeat is generally added to the broth and may be in the form of larger, chunkier pieces (even including bone) or thin-sliced fillets.\n\nCondiments vary significantly but may typically include some subset of the following:\n\nThe creation of a rich, personal broth is a quintessential part of the mixian experience.\n\nMixian is popular in Yunnan Province, where it can be found in many streets and villages, and is occasionally available in other mainland Chinese cities. It is generally very difficult to obtain outside of mainland China, probably since the fresh method of preparation could be seen to necessitate a certain minimum volume of consumption in order to be commercially viable. It is relatively similar to noodles consumed in neighbouring Laos (\"feu\") and Vietnam (\"phở\"), with the key difference that the base \"mixian\" broth is usually heavily personalized by the customer in Yunnanese tradition, and the establishment's own pre-made broth is less adulterated and more significantly appreciated/judged as a key factor of the in Vietnam (and perhaps to a lesser extent Laos). Dishes like \"nan gyi thohk\" and \"baik kut kyee kaik\" in various parts of Myanmar are similar dimension rice noodle based but different broadly in flavour profile (tending more toward flavours in Indian cuisine with ingredients such as chickpea flour) and preparatory method (far greater use of frying). It is more common in unadulterated Yunnanese form in commercial centers of Myanmar with growing Chinese populations, such as Mandalay. Dishes in Thailand such as \"pad thai\" also rely on rice noodles, though often they are flat and therefore more similar to Chinese \"juanfen\" or Yunnanese \"migan\". A Tibetan broth-based noodle dish using wheat-flour instead of rice-flour noodles, \"thukpa\", is thought to have originated in eastern Tibet (ie. closer to Yunnan) is made and enjoyed throughout Bhutan, northeast India, Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet.\n\n"}

The practice began predominantly Catholic, but is now practiced by all Christians as a blessing from the local priest and pastors that is meant to ensure a safe and bountiful season.\n\nIn most ports, the event was brought by immigrants who held strongly to their Christian religious beliefs. The events that are part of the ritual vary by community and range from a simple ceremony to a multi-day festival including a church service, Parades, Pageantry, Dancing, Feasting, and Contests.\n\nMost states of Australia have had ports and fishing community traditions of blessing the fleet \n\nThe tradition of the blessing of the fleet is spread along the eastern seaboard and the Great Lakes region.\n\nAnnual Blessing of the Fleet festivals are held throughout communities all along the Gulf Coast; each year boats parade down local waters to receive the blessing of the priest before the opening of the shrimp season. The shrimping industry has a long history in the area and has\nbecome intrinsically tied to local individual and community identities. 88th Annual Blessing of the Fleet\n\nPortuguese immigrants introduced the event to their new home in Brunswick, Georgia, around the time of World War II, more than sixty years ago. The blessing is held on Mother's Day to honor Our Lady of Fatima, the patron saint of Portugal, and mothers in the parish. The event begins with a morning mass and the ceremonial \"May crowning\" of the statue of Our Lady of Fatima, followed by a parishioners parade around Hanover Square, adjacent to the church. The procession is led by a Knights of Columbus honor guard and 8 men carrying the statue. The statue’s base is decorated with ferns and fresh red (for living mothers) and white (for deceased mothers) flowers. An anchor made of red and white flowers is also placed at the statue’s base.\nThe celebration then moves to the waterfront, where shrimp trawlers, freshly painted and decorated, circle the waterfront. The \"working\" boats are usually matched by an equal number of recreational watercraft.\n\nThe priest from St. Francis and the Knights of Columbus honor guard board one of the boats and the priest sprinkles Holy water and blesses each boat as it passes by. During the procession, the boats are judged on their decorations, with prizes awarded to the best.\nAfter the last boat has been blessed, the boats move up the East River to St. Simons Sound, where the flower anchor is laid upon the water in memory of the local fishermen who perished at sea.\n\nDarien, Georgia, has held an annual blessing since 1968. The blessing is held on the Darien River on a Sunday afternoon each spring, but the date varies. It is scheduled to coincide with a falling tide because a rising tide could drive the boats into the bridge—a reminder that they are always at the mercy of the weather. The celebration in Darien begins early in the week with activities that include an evening prayer service, a fishermen's fish fry, and a three-day festival with arts & crafts, food vendors, lots of families and kid-oriented events, live entertainment and fireworks on Saturday night. Local clerics of various denominations stand ready on the Darien bridge to bless the boats which then turnaround and move down the Darien River and back into the Atlantic to begin the Spring shrimping season.\n\nThe celebration in Jacksonville, Florida is a simple ceremony that was first held in 1985. While it is held on Palm Sunday, and an Orthodox priest does the blessings, it is a fun, festive boat parade. Some of the participants go overboard with their decorations. Typically, more than 150 vessels participate in the Blessing, ranging from ships to kayaks. This event has also been commemorated in St. Augustine, Florida since 1946.\n\nMcClellanville, SC has held The Lowcountry Shrimp Festival and Blessing of the Fleet annually since 1976. The event is held at the fishing community’s Municipal Landing on Jeremy Creek in McClellanville the first Saturday of May each year. The Blessing of the Fleet ceremony is an age-old tradition in which boats parade past the dock where the local clergy pray for a safe and bountiful season. As the clergy give their blessing a beautiful Magnolia Wreath covered with Red Roses is tossed into the water in memory of and to honor McClellanville fishermen. This is typically the time of year the boats are preparing for the opening of the season and are freshly painted, cleaned up and looking their best. The boats decorate for the festival and are usually loaded with people who love to ride in the parade, which is quite picturesque. The remainder of the day is filled with family entertainment, children’s games and local seafood dishes, such as boiled and fried shrimp dinners, shrimp kabobs, frog more stew, clam chowder, fish stew, barbecue and more.\n\nThe annual Blessing of the Fleet & Seafood Festival in Mount Pleasant, SC pays tribute to local shrimping and fishing industry, offering a boat parade, live music, craft show and lots of free activities with the picturesque Ravenel Bridge and Charleston Harbor for a backdrop! The festival is held on the last Sunday in April every year. Continuing the tradition begun by the Magwood family, local shrimpers who started the festival in 1988, every year the net proceeds from the festival have been donated to local nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe Blessing of the Fleet in Portage des Sioux, Missouri has a 50+ year history and is held each year on the Third Saturday of July in front of the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rivers.\n\nThe Blessing of the Fleet in the nation's capital is one of the premier events of the region's boating season. Held in the Spring along Washington, D.C.'s Southwest Waterfront, it is hosted by the Port of Washington Yacht Club and supported by several yacht clubs and marinas in the area. 2011 marked the 36th year that the Blessing has taken place. With activity on land as well as on the water, the event is an exciting display of pageantry and seamanship that draws up to 100 boats each year.\n\nThe first Blessing of the Fleet celebration is to be held on the eve of the two year anniversary of a large fire that threatened many boats as well as lives of some of the crew. The event is being advertised locally with signs as well as on Facebook. The event will feature a trout boil with a portion of the proceeds benefiting the Algoma Fire Department, and Paster Chris Jackson will be performing the ceremony. The Blessing of the Fleet is planned to be an annual kick off event, adding to the rich history of Lake Michigan trout and salmon fishing out of the historic port.\n\nThe city of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, commemorated its one hundreth anniversary of the Blessing of the Fleet, known locally as El Paseo del Virgen del Carmen, in July 2017. The tradition is an inheritance of Spanish colonialism; in Spain, the patron saint of the fleet is Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The parish of Saint Charles Bartholomew was established in Aguadilla in 1780, adorned by an image of the virgin. In 1917, the first Blessing was initiated by the Augustinian friar Juan de Gorostiza. Festivities include a celebratory mass and procession down the waterfront, followed by a passage of the boats from Aguadilla to a nearby beach.\n\n"}

The cakes, often simply referred to as souls, are given out to soulers (mainly consisting of children and the poor) who go from door to door during the days of Allhallowtide singing and saying prayers \"for the souls of the givers and their friends\". The practice in England dates to the medieval period, and was continued there until the 1930s, by both Protestant and Catholic Christians. In Sheffield and Cheshire, the custom has continued into modern times. In Lancashire and in the North-east of England soul cakes were known as Harcakes.\n\nThe practice of giving and eating soul cakes continues in some countries today, such as Portugal (where it is known as Pão-por-Deus and occurs on All Saint's Day and All Souls Day), as well as the Philippines (where it is known as Pangangaluwa and occurs on All Hallow's Eve). In other countries, souling is seen as the origin of the practice of trick-or-treating. In the United States, some churches, during Allhallowtide, have invited people to come receive sweets from them and have offered \"pray for the souls of their friends, relatives or even pets\" as they do so. Among Catholics and Lutherans, some parishioners have their soul cakes blessed by a priest before being distributed; in exchange, the children promise to pray for the souls of the deceased relatives of the giver during the month of November, which is a month dedicated especially to praying for the Holy Souls. Any leftover soul cakes are shared among the distributing family or given to the poor.\n\nThe tradition of giving soul cakes was celebrated in Britain or Ireland during the Middle Ages, although similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy.\n\nThe cakes are usually filled with allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger or other sweet spices, raisins or currants, and before baking are topped with the mark of a cross to signify that these were alms. They were traditionally set out with glasses of wine, an offering for the dead as in early Christian tradition, and either on All Hallows' Eve (Halloween), All Saints' Day or All Souls' Day, children would go \"souling\", or ritually begging for cakes door to door.\n\nSouling is a Christian practice carried out during Allhallowtide and Christmastide. The custom was popular in England and is still practised to a minor extent in Sheffield and Cheshire during Allhallowtide. The custom was also popular in Wales and has counterparts in the Philippines and Portugal that are practiced to this day.\n\nAccording to Morton (2013), Souling was once performed throughout the British Isles and the earliest activity was reported in 1511. However, by the end of the 19th century, the extent of the practice during Allhallowtide was limited to parts of England and Wales. \nSouling is an English festival. According to Gregory (2010), Souling involved a group of people visiting local farms and cottages. The merrymakers would sing a \"traditional request for apples, ale, and soul cakes. The songs were traditionally known as Souler's songs and were sung in a lamentable tone during the 1800s. Sometimes adult soulers would use a musical instrument, such as a Concertina. \n\nRogers (2003) believes Souling was traditionally practised in the counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, peak district of Derbyshire, Somerset and Herefordshire. However, Souling also was associated with other areas. Hutton (2001) believes Souling took place in Hertfordshire. Palmer (1976) states that Souling took place on All Saints day in Warwickshire. However, the custom of Souling ceased to be followed relatively early in the county of Warwickshire but the dole instituted by John Collet in Solihull (now within West Midlands) in 1565 was still being distributed in 1826 on All Souls day. The announcement for collection was made by ringing church bells. Further, soul-cakes were still made in Warwickshire (and other parts of Yorkshire) even though no one visited for them. \n\nAccording to Brown (1992) Souling was performed in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands; and according to Raven (1965) the tradition was also kept in parts of the Black Country. The prevalence of Souling was so localised in some parts of Staffordshire that it was observed in Penn but not in Bilston, both localities now in modern Wolverhampton. In Staffordshire, the \"custom of Souling was kept on All Saints' Eve\" (halloween). \n\nSimilarly in Shropshire, during the late 19th century, \"there was set upon the board at All Hallows Eve a high heap of Soul-cakes\" for visitors to take. The songs sung by people in Oswestry (Shropshire) contained some Welsh. \n\nAccording to Harrowven (1979), Souling is \"a fusion of pagan and Christian ritual\". The customs associated with Souling during Allhallowtide include or included consuming and/or distributing soul cakes, singing, carrying lanterns, dressing in disguise, bonfires, playing divination games, carrying a horse's head and performing plays. \n\nSoul cakes formed a key part of the Souling traditions. In Staffordshire, the cakes were also called Soul-mass or \"somas\" cakes. In East Yorkshire, \"somas loaves\" were traditionally distributed. In some counties, the Soul-mass cake was \"made on All Souls' Day, November 2nd, and always in a triangular shape\". Soul-mass cakes were often kept for good luck with one lady in Whitby being reported in the 1860s having a soul-mass loaf one hundred years old. According to Atkinson (1868), soul-mass loaves \"were sets of square farthing cakes with currants in the centre, commonly given by bakers to their customers\". Sometimes, oat cakes were given in Lancashire and Herefordshire. In Warwickshire, during the 1840s, it was traditional to consume seed cakes during All Hallows which coincided with \"the end of the wheat seed-time\".\n\nThe traditions associated with Souling included Soulers visiting houses with \"hollowed-out turnip lanterns\" with a candle inside which represented a soul trapped in purgatory. Smith (1989) notes that in parts of Yorkshire, \"children still appear on door steps with turnip lanterns and disguised as witches, ghosts and skeletons\". In Northern England, people sometimes went souling in disguise wearing long black cloaks. At times, children went out Souling in disguise. According to the Folk-lore Society publication of 1940, children went Souling in costume. Such masquerading in costume was either a tribute to saints or imitated spirits.\n\nBonfires were also lit on Halloween and during Hallowtide which Roud (2008) suggests may be related to the Purgation of souls by holy fire. Fires known as Tindle fires were made by children on All Souls night in Derbyshire. In Lancashire, bonfires were lit on Halloween which were known as Teanlay fires which were lit on many hills to observe the fast (feast) of All Souls and the night was called Teanlay Night (after which the Teanlowe Shopping Centre is named in Poulton-le-Fylde). \n\nAccording to Hardwick (1872), the burning of fires on Halloween may also be related to earlier practices. In the English countryside, people lit bonfires to ward off evil spirits. Glassie (1969) believes that fires on Halloween were lit into modern times in the Celtic areas of \"northern and western most counties of England\". During the 1850s, in Carleton, Lancashire, fires were lit to \"defend the corn from darnel\". \n\nAs an alternative to bonfires, in Lancashire, candles were carried between 11 pm and midnight on Halloween in a procession up the hills in a custom known as 'lating the witches'. If the candles continuously burnt then the witches powers would not affect the candle holder as \"it was firmly believed in Lancashire that the witches assembled on this night at their general rendezvous in the Forest of Pendle\" which relates to the 17th century Pendle witches. East of Pendle, candles were lit in every window an hour before midnight; if the candle burnt out before midnight, it was believed evil would follow. According to Frazer (1935) at Longridge Fell, during the early part of the 19th century, \"parties went from house to house in the evening collecting candles,one for each inmate, and offering their services to late or leet the witches\". Hampson (1841) notes that the words 'lating' and 'leeting' are derived from the Saxon word 'leoht' meaning light.\n\nGlassie (1969) suggests that long after 1 November was dedicated to All Saints' day, a Christian festival, people still continued to practice older pagan beliefs, such as playing divination games on All Saints' evening. The Chambers's Encyclopædia (1871) states that on Halloween in England, \"it was long customary to crack nuts, duck for apples in a tub of water, and perform other harmless fireside revelries\". According to Green (1859), \"in some parts of England, the Souling Customs have nuts connected with them, and All Souls' Eve is then named, Nut-crack Night\". Such games were also played on Halloween leading to Halloween being known as nut-crack night in the north of England. \n\nAnother game involved the use of apples and in some parts of England, Halloween was known as snap-apple night. In Staffordshire, one form of the game involved suspending a string from the ceiling, and attaching an apple at the end. The apple was then swung in a pendulum motion. The players would need to bite the apple with their hands behind their backs. At [Knowle, West Midlands|Knowle]] near Solihull, the winner of a game of apple bobbing peeled the apple and \"threw the parings over her shoulder. The shape of the peel on the ground could indicate the initials of a future spouse\". Apple bobbing is still played on Halloween. According to Green (1980), \"apples turn up in Hallowe'en games as an indication of immortality for you are trying to seize the magic fruit from under water, or from a string hung from the ceiling, as if you were snatching a fragment of life from the darkness\".\n\nPlaying of divination games with apples was also popular on other days dedicated to saints such as St Clement's day on 23 November which was known as Bite-Apple night in places such as Wednesbury (Sandwell) and Bilston (Wolverhampton) when people went \"Clementing\" in a similar manner to Souling. The Clementing custom was also observed in Aston, Sutton Coldfield, Curdworth, Minworth and Kingsbury. During the 19th century, St. Clement was a popular saint in West Bromwich and during the 1850s, children and others in neighbouring Oldbury also begged for apples on St. Clement's day and money on St. Thomas's day, which takes place on 21 December. In Walsall, apples and nuts were provided by the local council on St. Clement's day.\n\nIn some parts of Cheshire, during the 19th century, adults and children went Souling performing plays and carrying an Old Hob which consisted of a horse's head enveloped in a sheet. The head would be put on a pole and sometimes, a candle would be lit inside, in which case the pole bearer would be covered in a sheet. During the early 1900s, men in Warburton went out on All Saints day with lanterns at night with one of the men wearing a horse's skull called the \"Old Warb\" and visited farmer's houses for drink and money. Barber (1910) believes the use of an imitation of a horse's head by Soulers resulted in Souling \"being grafted on to the pagan custom of 'hodening'\".\n\nBy the latter half of the 19th century, states Simpson (1976), it was more usual for children to go out Souling. Further, by the 19th century, memories of begging for bread \"for the sake of souls departed\" had faded, \"leaving only the name soul-cake\". \n\nThe educational reforms of 1870 meant that children, other than very small children, went to school which was when Souling would be carried by children and this affected the extent of the practice. However, the custom persisted in \"rural Cheshire, northern Shropshire and adjoining part of Staffordshire\" up to the 1950s. Hole (1975) noted in her book \"English Traditional Customs\" that \"in Cheshire and Shropshire, small bands of children still go Souling through the villages on All Souls' Day (or on All Saints' Day which is its Eve). They visit the houses and sing one or other of the traditional Souling-songs, and are then rewarded with gifts of money, or cakes, or sweets\". Simpson (1976) also states that in some villages in Cheshire, children have maintained the Souling tradition and go out Souling either on Halloween or the first two days of November.\n\nHutton (2001) believes Souling is being observed in modern times in Sheffield. The custom on the outskirts of Sheffield is known as caking-night and traditionally took take place either on 30/31 October or 1/2 November where children \"said the traditional caking rhyme (\"Cake, cake, copper, copper\"), and received about ten pence from each householder\" as reported in Lore and Language, Volume 3, Issues 6-10 in 1982. Prior to the Second World War, children in Dungworth, Yorkshire, went 'caking' wearing masks and visiting houses in the village, \"asking the householder to guess their identity\". According to Sykes (1977), caking night is also known as caking neet which traditionally takes place on 1 November, or the first Monday if the first falls on a Saturday or a Sunday. According to Chainey (2018), soul caking is still very popular in Cheshire.\n\nIn the county of Cheshire, Souling plays were traditionally performed. This involved groups of soulers visiting farmhouses performing a death and resurrection play. One of the members would wear a horse-skull without which the play could not be performed. According to Whitmore (2010), the plays were presided by Beelzebub (the Devil) and if two Soulers' gangs met, they had to fight and smash the losers' horse skull. A link between Souling and the deceased was made by Wilfred Isherwood, leader of the Antrobus cast, when he said in 1954 that they believed in Souling and ghosts.\n\nSouling plays still take place in Cheshire where groups such as the Jones' Ale Soul Cakers perform annually. The villages of \nAntrobus and Comberbach are also noted for Souling plays in Cheshire. \n\nThe Antrobus’ troop perform annually in pubs around Cheshire between 31st October and 12th November. The characters include the Letter-in, Black Prince, King George, the Quack Doctor, and ‘Dick’ the Wild Horse and his Driver. The characters are believed to represent the souls of the dead. \n\nIn Lancashire, the evening before Halloween is known as Mischief Night. According to Sommerlad (2018), Mischief Night is \"known by different dialect names from one region to another – “Mizzy Night” in Liverpool, “Chievous Night” in Yorkshire – the occasion has been likened to a coming of age ritual for teenagers, emboldened to throw eggs, stick chewing gum into the locks of car doors and deck neighbours’ trees in rolls of toilet paper. The seasonal availability of fireworks also provides a popular addition to the arsenal\". According to Roud (2010), Mischief Night \"has proved a very strong pull in places like Liverpool\" on 30 October, the eve of Halloween.\nRogers (2003) believes Souling took place in Monmouth and Caenarvonshire in Wales. According to Ross (2001), in many parts of Wales, up to the eighteenth century, the Souling ceremony involved lighting candles in the parish Church. Parishioners donated the candles and \"when they were lit, the way in which the flame burned, faintly or brightly, would serve as a prognosis of the future\". The ceremony also involved preparing sole cakes which were known as pice rhanna. Sometimes, during the 19th century, upon receiving the soul cakes, people would \"pray to God to bless the next crop of wheat\".\n\nSouling was known as hel solod and hel bwyd cennady meirw, \"collecting the food of the messenger of the dead\". This custom took place in many parts of Wales on All Souls' Eve. In 1823, it was noted that there was a tradition in Wales for the messenger, known as cennad ymeirw, to knock on doors and say 'Deca, Deca, dowch i'r drws, a rhowch . . . igennady meirw'. [Deca, Deca, come to the door... and give to the messenger of death]. If nothing was received, the response would be 'Deca, Deca, o dan y drws, a phen, y wraig yn siwtrws ['Deca, Deca, under the door, and the wife's head in smithereens]. Food known as Bwyd Cennad y Meirw was also left outside and the hearth was prepared at night for the arrival of the dead relatives. According to Ellwood (1977), doors were left unbolted. Children went out on All Saints' day too in Denbighshire and Merionethshire asking for Bwyd Cennad y Meirw in the late 1800s. People in North Wales also distributed soul-cakes on All Souls' Day and lit a great fire called Coel Coeth on All Saints' Eve \"when every family about an hour in the night\" made a great fire near their house. \n\nIn Pembrokeshire, people went Souling for bread and cheese. In Gower, the dish associated with All Souls' day is souly cake which is a fruit/spice bun. According to Duncan (2010), bakers gave souly cakes (small loaves) to their customers which were kept by them in their homes to bring good luck. Such cakes, according to Duncan, are still baked in Wales.\n\nIn 1891, Rev. M. P. Holme of Tattenhall, Cheshire, collected the song traditionally sung during souling, from a little girl at the local school. Two years later, the text and tune were published by folklorist Lucy Broadwood, who commented that souling was still practised at that time in Cheshire and Shropshire. Further recordings of the traditional soul-cake song were collected in various parts of England until the 1950s. Versions collected later may have been influenced by folk revival recordings of the song by such groups as The Watersons.\n\nThe 1891 version contains a chorus and three verses:\n\n<poem>\n[Chorus]\nA soul! a soul! a soul-cake!\nPlease good Missis, a soul-cake!\nAn apple, a pear, a plum, or a cherry,\nAny good thing to make us all merry.\nOne for Peter, two for Paul\nThree for Him who made us all.\n\n[Verse 1]\nGod bless the master of this house, \nThe misteress also, \nAnd all the little children \nThat round your table grow. \nLikewise young men and maidens, \nYour cattle and your store ; \nAnd all that dwells within your gates, \nWe wish you ten times more.\n\n[Verse 2]\nDown into the cellar, \nAnd see what you can find, \nIf the barrels are not empty, \nWe hope you will prove kind. \nWe hope you will prove kind, \nWith your apples and strong beer, \nAnd we'll come no more a-souling \nTill this time next year.\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe lanes are very dirty, \nMy shoes are very thin, \nI've got a little pocket \nTo put a penny in. \nIf you haven't got a penny, \nA ha'penny will do ; \nIf you haven't get a ha'penny, \nIt's God bless you</poem>\nIn 1963, the American folk group Peter, Paul and Mary recorded this as \"A' Soalin\", including all the verses as well as parts of \"Hey, Ho, Nobody Home\" and \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\" (which are traditionally associated with Christmas). The musical arrangement (including the accompaniment, chords, and interpolations from the other traditional songs) is quite different from the published 1893 version and was copyrighted by members of the group.\n\nAmerican Hallowe'en composer Kristen Lawrence found two historical tunes associated with soul cakes as she was researching souling songs for her 2009 \"A Broom With A View\" album. As Lawrence heard the traditional Cheshire tune, she was struck that the beginning notes were the same as the mediaeval plainchant Dies Irae, \"Day of Judgment\", calling the people to repent and pray for the dead. It seemed plausible that the Cheshire tune could be a folk corruption of the chant as children and beggars asked for cakes in return for praying for the dead.\nThe song \"Soul Cake\" from British rock musician Sting's 2009 album \"If on a Winter's Night...\" seems to be an adaptation of the Peter, Paul, and Mary version, in that both depart from historical accuracy by referring to Christmas rather than All Saints' Day or All Souls' Day. But the 1893 version of the song already shares lines from similar Christmas carols: \"Here We Come A-Wassailing\" and \"Christmas is A-Coming\".\n\nIn the Philippines, the practice of souling is called Pangangaluwa and is practiced on All Hallow's Eve among children in rural areas. People drape themselves in white cloths to represent souls and then visit houses, where they sing in return for prayers and sweets. \n\nIn Portugal, groups of children go souling on All Hallow's Day, collecting \"Pão-por-Deus\" (bread for God's sake) from their neighbours.\n\n\n"}

This is opposed to K-Stock and A-Stock which use plug doors. They are currently operating primarily on the Tsuen Wan Line and Kwun Tong Line but are also operating on the Island Line and Tseung Kwan O Line alongside newer rolling stock. Each car is 3200 mm width over body panel, floor to rail is 1100 mm high and roof to rail is 3910 mm high.\n\nThe refurbishment process involved altering the fibreglass facade on the exterior ends to modernize their appearance, as well as the installation of the advanced digital voice announcement (DVA) and passenger information systems. United Goninan was subsequently awarded a contract to maintain the MTR rolling stock.

However, in July 2015, MTR announced that CSR Qingdao Sifang had won an order to build 93 trainsets that is set to replace all M-Trains by 2023, on grounds that it was \"better value for money\". In addition, the current Westinghouse signalling system will be phased out in favour of a communications-based train control (CBTC) system, similar to that of the West Rail Line and South Island Line. In the meantime, 36 of the M-Trains have been equipped with CBTC equipment, supplied by Thales, for use on the Tsuen Wan Line as an interim measure while their replacement trains are being delivered.\n\n\n"}

The dish was served on a big plate by restaurateurs along the Xinjiang highways as a quick fix for hungry truck drivers who often arrived at an odd time of the day. Its rich flavor and heartiness quickly made the dish a favorite of the region, and the dish then spread to the rest of China.\n\nThe main ingredients are chicken, bell peppers and potatoes, cooked with onions, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, ground cumin, star anise, ground Sichuan peppers, cooking oil, also optionally soy sauce and beer.\n\nThe chicken is cut into bite size pieces (usually unboned), sautéed with spices and coarsely chopped vegetables, and simmered in broth, providing a savory and spicy casserole-like dish. It is usually served with \"latiaozi\" (hand stretched noodles) or \"laghman\", and shared by family and friends in a communal manner.\n\nOther variations of the dish may be served with \"nan\" (馕包大盘鸡), a staple bread widely consumed in Xinjiang, usually served baked or roasted in Xinjiang restaurants and other places. With the sauce, the bread becomes very soft and moist, producing a melt-in-the-mouth savoury texture.\n\n"}

It is prepared in common ovens between midnight and dawn to be sold fresh and crunchy by vendors in the morning.\n\nThe Chilean marraqueta is, strictly speaking, a se-tenant pair of small rolls, baked with \"another\" pair attached, comprising four rolls in total; some confusion can be caused when ordering one marraqueta, as this may be interpreted as either two or four rolls.\n\nThe recipe arrived in La Paz in 1908 in the hands of the Greek immigrant Michel Jorge Callispieris, from Chios island. Bread in both locations share indeed the same characteristics: crunchiness and slightly salty flavor.\n\nThe marraqueta of La Paz was declared cultural patrimony in 2006.\n\nMany historians agree that the \"marraqueta\" originated in Valparaíso, Chile, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when major Chilean ports such as Valparaíso and Talcahuano received thousands of European immigrants. The story goes the bread was invented by two French baker brothers in Valparaíso whose last name was \"Teran-Marraquett\", and the bread went on to become very popular among Chileans in a very short time. This story would explain both the \"marraqueta\" and \"pan francés\" names. In Valparaíso itself, somewhat confusingly, marraqueta means the four small rolls while half of this is called \"pan batido\", the use of which is a shibboleth of the Port of Valparaíso (but is ignored by national supermarket chains). There is no clear agreement on what is considered one unit of marraqueta and while some bakers claim is the four pieces of bread, some others claim that a unit is only half (so they say that the four pieces are two marraquetas).\n\nAn alternative theory of the bread’s origin was proposed by French naturalist and botanist Claude Gay, who suggested that \"marraqueta\" was first eaten in Chile in the 18th century.\n\nCurrently marraqueta is the most widely consumed bread in Chile and is used as toast, in sandwiches and as a binder for certain recipes such as \"pastel de carne\" (meatloaf). It is widely considered the quintessential Chilean staple food.\n\n\"Marraqueta\" is made from flour, water, yeast and salt. It does not contain fat and the proofing process takes longer than other breads. The unusual form of the four buns allows it to be divided very easily.\n\n\n"}

They are a hard, white and chewy, rectangular mint-flavoured lolly, which on chewing become so sticky that they are notorious for causing fillings to come out. They were originally packaged in 5lb (around 2.2 kg) bulk tins or 3oz (around 85g) cardboard boxes, but now come in packs ranging from 150g - 1 kg. Minties are wrapped in waxed paper with a cartoon underneath the logo with the common caption \"It's moments like these you need Minties\".\n\nAbout 500 million are consumed each year.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Minties released 'Spearmint Minties', however, these were taken off the market for unknown reasons just before the end of 1999.\nIn 2013 Nestlé (Australia) introduced Allen's Minties \"Smooth Mints Choc & Vanilla\" which had choc-mint and vanilla-mint varieties in the one packet.\n\nMinties were invented in 1922 by James Noble Stedman (1860–1944), son of company founder (and Australia's first confectioner) James Stedman (1840–1913). Minties were patented in 1926, and were manufactured by James Stedman — Henderson Sweets Limited at the \"SweetAcres\" factory at Rosebery, New South Wales. Other well-known lines made at Sweetacres were \"Fantales\" and \"Talky Toffies\".\n\nIn 1968, Stedman-Henderson was taken over by Hoadleys, which was acquired in 1971 by Rowntree's which was taken over globally by Nestlé in 1981. They are now sold as \"Allens Minties\" (Nestlé acquired the Allens brand in 1985.)\n\nIn 1930 or 1931, a factory was set up in Auckland, New Zealand. Cadbury now manufacture the lollies as \"Pascall Minties\". In November 2009, Cadbury New Zealand announced they were moving production from Auckland to Thailand and changing to a softer formulation (less stressful on teeth and may be consumed more quickly). Curiously, the 200g packets sold in Australia as (Nestlé) Allens Minties in 2010 are clearly labelled \"Made in New Zealand\".\n\nNewspaper advertising appears to have dropped off considerably, both in quantity and quality, between 1931 and 1940.\n\nDuring World War II and until 1946, supply of confectionery was restricted; what output there was went to serving troops. Advertising resumed after cessation of hostilities, anticipating eventual availability. Rationing may have been on a state-by-state basis.\n\nMinties had been available in shops from 1923 or earlier, but became the subject of prominent advertising as \"The Universal Sweet\" in June 1926. Coincident with this launch, the SweetAcres company offered \"MINTIES Magic Drawing Book for your Girl or Boy\" for the price of return postage (one penny). This publication was a booklet of apparently blank pages whose pictures became evident when lightly rubbed with a soft pencil or crayon, in a similar manner to brass rubbing, and was last offered in September 1932.\n\nMinties' first cartoons, and the catchphrase \"It's moments like these ...\" appeared late in 1926; from then on providing an episodic documentation of an era.\n\nAt one stage in the 1940s Minties were using three different cartoons a week, appearing on every form of printed advertising: the 3oz (around 85g) boxes in which they were originally sold, newspapers and railway station hoardings.\n\nThe cartoons depict mishaps and unfortunate experiences, sometimes featuring recognisable sporting or political figures, but more often general comic situations, captioned \"It's moments like these\" or \"Another Minties moment\". The catchphrase \"It's moments like these\" has become part of the Australian language. The entry for \"Mintie\" in a major Australian dictionary defines the phrase as \"... widely current ... used allusively as an emblem of solace\".\n\nAt that time, the lolly wrappers (white waxed paper) were decorated only with the text \"Minties\" \"The Universal Sweet\" in red and green. Now the only artwork is on the wrappers; simple anonymous cartoons of people engaged in recognisable activities with no attempt at humour accompanied by the caption \"It's moments like these ...\".\n\nThe number of cartoonists to have drawn \"Minties moments\" is large.

{"id": "15991162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15991162", "title": "In vitro compartmentalization", "text": "In vitro compartmentalization\n\n\"In vitro\" compartmentalization (IVC) is an emulsion-based technology that generates cell-like compartments \"in vitro\". These compartments are designed such that each contains no more than one gene. When the gene is transcribed and/or translated, its products (RNAs and/or proteins) become 'trapped' with the encoding gene inside the compartment. By coupling the genotype (DNA) and phenotype (RNA, protein), compartmentalization allows the selection and evolution of phenotype.\n\nIn vitro compartmentalization method was first developed by Tawfik et al. Based on the idea that Darwinian evolution relies on the linkage of genotype to phenotype, Tawfik et al. designed aqueous compartments of water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions to mimic cellular compartments that can link genotype and phenotype. Emulsions of cell-like compartments were formed by adding \"in vitro\" transcription/translation reaction mixture to stirred mineral oil containing surfactants. The mean droplet diameter was measured to be 2.6 um by laser diffraction. As a proof of concept, Tawfik el al. designed an experiment that would transcribe and translate M. HaeIII gene in the presence of 107-fold excess of genes encoding another enzyme folA. 3’ of each gene is purposely designed to contain HaeIII R/M sequences, and when HaeIII methyltransferase was expressed from a M.HaeIII gene, it would methylate HaeIII R/M sequence and cause the gene to be resistant to restriction enzyme digestion. By selecting for DNA sequences that survive the endonuclease digestion, Tawfik el al. found there was enrichment for the M.HaeIII genes, i.e. 1000 fold in the first round of selection.\n\nWater-in-oil (w/o) emulsions are created by mixing aqueous and oil phases with the help of surfactants. A typical IVC emulsion is formed by first generating oil-surfactant mixture by stirring, and then gradually adding the aqueous phase to the oil-surfactant mixture. For stable emulsion formation, a mixture of HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) and low HLB surfactants are needed. Some combinations of surfactants used to generate oil-surfactant mixture are mineral oil / 0.5% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / sodium deoxycholate and a more heat stable version, light mineral oil / 0.4% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / 0.05% Triton X-100. The aqueous phase containing transcription and/or translation components is slowly added to the oil surfactants, and the formation of w/o is facilitated by homogenizing, stirring or using hand extruding device.\n\nThe emulsion quality can be determined by light microscopy and/or dynamic light scattering techniques. The emulsion is quite diverse, and greater homogenization speeds helps to produce smaller droplets with narrower size distribution. However, homogenization speeds has to be controlled, since speed over 13,500 r.p.m tends to result in a significant loss of enzyme activity on the level of transcription. The most widely used emulsion formation gives droplets with a mean diameter of 2-3μm, and an average volume of ~5 femtoliters, or 10 aqueous droplet per ml of emulsions. The ratio of genes to droplets is designed such that most of the droplets contains no more than a single gene statistically.\n\nIVC enables the miniaturization of large-scale techniques that can now be done on the micro scale including coupled \"in vitro\" transcription and translation (IVTT) experiments. Streamlining and integrating transcription and translation allows for fast and highly controllable experimental designs. IVTT can be done both in bulk emulsions and in microdroplets by utilizing droplet-based microfluidics. Microdroplets, droplets on the scale of pico to femtoliters, have been successfully used as single DNA molecule vessels. This droplet technology allows high throughput analysis with many different selection pressures in a single experimental setup. IVTT in microdroplets is preferred when overexpression of a desired protein would be toxic to a host cell minimizing the utility of the transcription and translation mechanisms.\n\nIVC has used bacterial cell, wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte (RRL) extracts for transcription and translation. It is also possible to use bacterial reconstituted translation system such as PURE in which translation components are individually purified and later combined. When expressing eukaryote or complex proteins, it is desirable to use eukaryotic translation systems such as wheat germ extract or more superior alternative, RRL extract. In order to use RRL for transcription and translation, traditional emulsion formulation cannot be used as it abolishes translation. Instead, a novel emulsion formulation: 4% Abil EM90 / light mineral oil was developed and demonstrated to be functional in expressing luciferase and human telomerase.\n\nOnce transcription and/or translation has completed in the droplets, emulsion will be broken by successive steps of removing mineral oil and surfactants to allow for subsequent selection. At this stage, it is crucial to have a method to ‘track’ each gene products to the encoding gene as they become free floating in a heterogeneous population of molecules. There are three major approaches to track down each phenotype to its genotype. The first method is to attach each DNA molecule with a biotin group and an additional coding sequence for streptavidin (STABLE display). All the newly formed proteins/peptides will be in fusion with streptavidin molecules and bind to their biotinylated coding sequence. An improved version attached two biotin molecules to the ends of a DNA molecule to increase the avidity between DNA molecule and streptavidin-fused peptides, and used a low GC content synthetic streptavidin gene to increase efficiency and specificity during PCR amplification. The second method is to covalently link DNA and protein. Two strategies have been demonstrated. The first is to form M.HaeIII fusion proteins. Each expressed protein/polypeptide will be in fusion with Hae III DNA methyltransferase domain, which is able to bind covalently to DNA fragments containing the sequence 5′-GGC*-3′, where C* is 5-fluoro-2 deoxycytidine. The second strategy is to use monomeric mutant of VirD2 enzyme. When a protein/peptide is expressed in fusion with Agrobacterium protein VirD2, it will bind to its DNA coding sequence that has a single-stranded overhang comprising VirD2 T-border recognition sequences. The third method is to link phenotype and genotype via beads. The beads used will be coated with streptavidin to allow for the binding of biotinylated DNA, in addition, the beads will also display cognate binding partner to the affinity tag that will be expressed in fusion with the protein/peptide.\n\nDepending on the phenotype to be selected, difference selection strategies will be used. Selection strategy can be divided into three major categories: selection for binding, selection for catalysis and selection for regulation. The phenotype to be selected can range from RNA to peptide to protein. By selecting for binding, the most commonly evolved phenotypes are peptide/proteins that have selective affinity to a specific antibody or DNA molecule. An example is the selection of proteins that have affinity to zinc finger DNA by Sepp et al. By selecting for catalytic proteins/RNAs, new variants with novel or improved enzymatic property are usually isolated. For example, new ribozyme variants with trans-ligase activity were selected and exhibited multiple turnovers. By selecting for regulation, inhibitors of DNA nucleases can be selected, such as protein inhibitors of the Colicin E7 DNase.\n\nComparing to other \"in vitro\" display technologies, IVC has two major advantages. The first advantage is its ability to control reactions within the droplets. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic components can be delivered to each droplet in a step-wise fashion without compromising the chemical integrity of the droplet, and thus by controlling what to be added and when to be added, the reaction in each droplet is controlled. In addition, depending on the nature of the reaction to be carried out, the pH of each droplet can also be changed. More recently, photocaged substrates were used and their participation in a reaction was regulated by photo-activation. The second advantage is that IVC allows the selection of catalytic molecules. As an example, Griffiths et al. was able to select for phosphotriesterase variants with higher K by detecting product formation and amount using anti-product antibody and flow cytometry respectively.\n\n"}

Founded in 1954, it occurs every two years at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. \n\nYoung women from all over the United States and from around the globe are brought together at the ball and the surrounding parties, including daughters of Presidents of the United States, billionaire businessmen, diplomats, nobility, ambassadors and governors. Over the years the ball has benefited numerous charities from the International Debutante Ball Foundation including the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard and Airmen's Club of New York, a social club for members of the United States Armed Services. \n\nThe International Debutante Ball is considered the most prestigious debutante ball in the world.\n\nThe International Debutante Ball is held biennially in the Grand Ballroom of the exclusive and historical Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City; although from 2016 it is held at The Pierre in New York City due to the billion dollar renovations and temporary three-year closure of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Each ball is preceded by a number of events, dinners and parties for the debutantes, including the Bachelor's Brunch, in private Manhattan members-only clubs such as the Colony Club, 21 Club or the University Club of New York.\n\nAt the ball, each debutante is escorted by two men: one United States Military Academy cadet and one American civilian. According to \"New York\" magazine, the current organizer of the International Debutante Ball stated that \"Every young lady should have two men.\"\nCivilian escorts of the debutantes are young men of distinction, who are often scions of distinguished families, e.g. the Rockefeller family. Each debutante represents her state or country at the International Debutante Ball and a song, e.g. a national anthem or a song associated with the country where the debutante is from, is played by the renowned Lester Lanin Orchestra for the debutante when she is presented on stage. The military escort of the debutante also carries the flag of the country or US state where the debutante comes from. Each debutante must also greet approximately one thousand or more guests, from a close-knit social world, individually in the receiving line. Due to the fact that there are debutantes representing their own US state or country, the International Debutante Ball has been dubbed by publications as 'The United Nations of Debutante Balls and the private world of polite society'.\nGold and pink are the main traditional colors of the ball. The Grand Ballroom is thus decorated with gold, silver (symbolising elegance) and pink (symbolising femininity) decorations, which Countess Bobrinskoy oversees at each ball biennially, and guests dine on edible gold leaves. The debutantes also receive flower bouquets containing pink roses and golden leaves.\n\nThe ball is considered the \"ultimate networking event\" where members of the world's elite, rich and powerful meet up and mingle and where their daughters are prepared to enter the world of high society and foster lifelong international friendship with each other. The pink invitation that the chosen debutantes receive is written with gold ink and is therefore sometimes jokingly called the \"Golden Ticket\".\nThe International Debutante Ball has been described as a ball which \"most young women nowadays will never attend\" and which has largely become a \"who’s who of the upper class\", with daughters of US Presidents, billionaire businessmen, European royalty, US governors, and diplomats receiving invitations. The scene at the International Debutante Ball has been described as a \"Gatsby-style splendour in Manhattan's Waldorf-Astoria\" (referring to F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\").\n\nIn order to be presented as a debutante at the International Debutante Ball, debutantes must be recommended by a previous debutante of the International Debutante Ball. Debutantes must also be accepted by the Chairmen of the Debutante Committee of the International Debutante Ball and be able to afford the debutante presentation fee. Once chosen, each debutante is required to pay at least $22,000. Additionally, many debutantes spend thousands more for their required white haute couture gowns, celebrity hairdressers and other related expenses. \nDebutantes who are usually accepted are \"women of distinction\" who are highly accomplished young ladies in athletics, community service, academics, philanthropy and charity and are from well-connected families. The debutantes are young women who maintain the standards of civility, chastity, manners, etiquette and gentility. Chosen debutantes are usually between the ages of 17 and 21 years old.\nAccording to the current organizer of the ball, the debutantes must be well-known with connections in the New York debutante and high society and as long as 'the debutante has the right connections, she has a chance of being invited'. \nAccording to the \"New York Times\", the organiser of the ball stated that the ball does not want any \"Tootsie\" to participate or join \"the club\". \nDebutantes of the International Debutante Ball have been referred to as \"members of a special and very select, elite, social group and of a carefully guarded social circle\" and they have also been dubbed as \"high profile\" and \"preppy\".\nIt has been reported that some guests have paid at least $100,000 for a table at the ball.\n\nThe debutantes include royalty, members of imperial families, heiresses, aristocrats and daughters of many political figures including Presidents of the United States, such as the daughters and granddaughters of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Richard Nixon, President Lyndon B. Johnson, President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Ivanka Trump (daughter of President Donald Trump) and Sasha and Malia Obama (daughters of President Barack Obama) have also been invited to be presented as debutantes at the International Debutante Ball in New York City.\nThe International Debutante Ball has therefore been referred to as \"the debutante ball with the strongest (and bipartisan) ties to the White House\".\nDebutantes of the International Debutante Ball also include daughters of billionaire businessmen from the Forbes 400 and many Wall Street financiers.\n\nThe International Debutante Ball was founded in 1954 by socialite, philanthropist and humanitarian Beatrice Dinsmore Joyce, who was dubbed as the 'Duchess of Debs' and the 'Grand dame of debutante balls'. Joyce was inspired to create an American debutante ball after hearing Consuelo Vanderbilt make an observation about debutante balls and how lucky girls are who travel to debutante balls in different countries.\nThe band leader Lester Lanin played the music from the start in 1954 until his last ball in the 1990s. Every guest was given a special \"lanin hat\". The first balls were held at the Plaza Hotel, with 35 girls from different countries and different states. As it grew with more girls participating, it moved to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\n\nChairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Debutante Committee of the International Debutante Ball include or have included: \n\nOver the years, the International Debutante Ball has had the honor of presenting many notable young women to society, including, but not limited to:\n\nOther debutantes of the International Debutante Ball have included members of prominent American and international families, including:\n\nDebutantes of the International Debutante Ball have been dubbed as 'Blue Blooded Socialites', 'the crème de la crème of young women' and 'the next it girls' by the media and 'The luckiest girls in the world' by the \"New York Observer\".

Chief among the beneficiaries is the Soldiers', Sailors', Coast Guards', Marines' and Airmen's Club of Manhattan, which provides a home away from home for men and women of the United States Armed Services.\nThe ball has also been called \"the prettiest sight in this fine pretty world where the privileged class enjoys its privileges\", referring to a quote from \"The Philadelphia Story\".\nWhen a young woman has been presented as a debutante at the International Debutante Ball, she is considered to have become part of an \"exclusive organization and club\" of \"post-debutantes of the International Debutante Ball ranging from royalty to billionaire heiresses from all over the world who all have this debutante ball in common\". The Ball has been called a \"female version of the elitist and exclusive Bullingdon Club, but with good manners and without the vandalising rituals\".\nThe International Debutante Ball is considered a \"rite of passage\" into high society for the \"crème de la crème of young womanhood\". The debutantes of the International Debutante Ball form lifelong lasting friendships and connections with each other.

In its organisation, it is very similar to British Traditional Wicca groups such as Gardnerian Wicca, however, it does not trace its initiatory line to one of the old English covens. \n\nThe name \"Georgian\" refers to its founder, George Patterson, who founded the tradition in 1970 in the United States.\n\nThe Georgian Tradition was founded in 1970 by George Eliott (Pat) Patterson III, when he began teaching his first students, two women called Zanoni Silverknife and Tanith. It began as a small coven in Patterson’s home, in Bakersfield, California.\n\nPatterson claimed to have received early teachings from members of a Celtic Coven in Boston. He told his early initiates when World War II began, he enlisted in the Armed Forces and served for four years. On his return to Boston, he found family members had destroyed his Book and ritual items. He could not find the family he'd studied with. Despite research into this history, there is no independent evidence any such coven existed. At other times, he told students and initiates that he had been initiated into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Tradition, and at one point also claimed to have been initiated into the Craft by his father. Investigation of the claims of initiation into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Traditions have demonstrated no verification in the records of either of those traditions; initiation by his father can neither be proved nor disproved.\n\nSoon after forming the group, Patterson applied to the State of California for legal status as an incorporated church and through the Universal Life Church had a charter (1971) and Ministerial credentials for himself and Silverknife.\n\nPatterson gathered information, lessons and lore from many helpful sources. These included Doris and Sylvester Stuart of England, Lady Gwen Thompson of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.E.C.T.W.), and others. The Georgian Tradition is based on Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca practices, incorporating Etruscan lore from Leland, using those rites and rituals shared by the Sylvestrians and N.E.C.T.W. as well as material from New York Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.Y.C.T.W); Lord Hermes (Edmund Buczynski) and Lady Siobhan (Order of the Silver Wheel) were most helpful. Many of the rituals are similar to those published in various books on what is sometimes called \"British Traditional Wicca\" (BTW), such as Janet and Stewart Farrar's \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\" and \"The Witches' Way\", as well as the privately distributed version of what was later published as Ed Fitch's \"Grimoire of the Shadows\".\n\nGeorgian Wicca is therefore similar to Alexandrian and Gardnerian Wiccan practice, in that it is an initiatory line and oath-bound. Georgian Wicca, however, is not a recognized member of the BTW, as it lacks an important requirement - initiatory lineage back to one of the BTW covens in England. Therefore, it is considered BTW-derived.\n\nBeginning in 1976, Patterson edited the \"Georgian Newsletter\", a chatty, informal correspondence that helped to build the community of Georgians and link them with one another. Following his death in 1984, the newsletter continued for a few years, and subsequently ceased publication. The newsletter contained bits of gossip, \"Helpful Hints\", book reviews, and the ever popular feature \"Being a Witch is ... \"\n\nFollowing a lengthy hiatus, the Georgian Newsletter was revived as a free publication in 2007 by members of the tradition, a current archive (as of May 2013) exists at The Georgian Wicca Tradition Newsletter.\n\nGeorgians are now worldwide and growing; many are in the Armed Forces, carrying the Tradition with them. Recently, there has been an upsurge in those interested in reconnecting with or learning about the Georgian Tradition.\n\nAt present, there are known Georgian Covens in British Columbia, California, Florida, Oregon, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Washington, Utah, and Oklahoma. There is also a current effort being made to reconnect members of the Tradition.\n\nIn S. M. Stirling's Emberverse series, the Singing Moon Coven, which forms the basis of the Wiccan Clan MacKenzie, is described as:\n\nan eclectic Georgian group who favor Celtic symbolism\n\nA number of aspects of Georgian Wiccan derived practice are portrayed in the series.\n\n\n"}

L'Etivaz cheese is very similar to Gruyère surchoix's taste.\n\nL'Etivaz is a hamlet in the southwestern Swiss Alps, just under the Col des Mosses in the canton of Vaud. It has about 150 inhabitants. The cheese is made in the communes of Château-d'Œx, Rougemont, Rossinière, Ormont-Dessous, Ormont-Dessus, Leysin, Corbeyrier, Villeneuve, Ollon and Bex.\n\nIn the 1930s, a group of 76 Gruyère producing families felt that government regulations were allowing cheesemakers to compromise the qualities that made good Gruyère so special. They withdrew from the government's Gruyère program, and \"created\" their own cheese - L'Etivaz - named for the village around which they all lived. They founded a cooperative in 1932, and the first cheese cellars were built in 1934.\n\nL'Etivaz is made essentially as Gruyère was 100 years ago. It is made only when the cows are doing their summer grazing in Alpine pastures. It must be made in traditional copper cauldrons, and only over old-style, open wood fires. The resulting cheese is a bit creamier and less sharp than Antique Gruyère, yet smooth and flavorful. L'Etivaz has a firm texture with a fruity, slightly nutty flavor, which varies depending on the soil of the different pastures. It is yellow ivory in color and slightly sticky due to its saltiness. It is aged for 5 to 13 months before it is eaten. \n\nThe cheese is formed into a wheel, in diameter with a thickness of and weighing from . Originally, the cheese had a large distribution of tiny holes; however, the modern cheese rarely shows holes. One may see the occasional horizontal fissure under the rind. It is eaten at the end of a meal with raisins or fresh figs. Another excellent accompaniment is nuts and slices of pears.\n\nIn 2000, the cheese L'Etivaz was the first Swiss product other than wine to obtain an \"appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC). In 2013, the certification was replaced by the \"appellation d'origine protégée\" (AOP).\n\n"}

The pineapple jam is usually made by slowly reducing and caramelizing grated fresh pineapple that has been mixed with sugar and spices - usually cinnamon, star anise and cloves.\n\nTypical shapes include a flat, open tart topped with pineapple jam under a lattice of pastry, rolls filled with jam that are open at the ends, and jam-filled spheres or elongated shape.\n\nIn Indonesia it is called \"nastar\" which is contraction of \"nanas tart\" (\"Ananas\" or pineapple tart), is a popular cookie or \"kue kering\" during festive occasions of \"Lebaran\", \"Natal\" and \"Imlek\". Just like many of Indonesian \"kue kering\" (cookies), it can trace its origin to Dutch influence on Indonesian pastry, cake and cookies tradition. \n\nMost of \"nastar\" in Indonesia has round shape with a diameter of about 2 centimetres. The pineapple jam is filled inside instead of spread on top. The cookie is often decorated with small pieces of cloves or raisins on top of it.\n\nConsidered a \"festive cookie\", pineapple tarts are especially popular during Hari Raya, Chinese New Year and Deepavali celebrations in Singapore and Malaysia. They are also sold all year round by commercial bakeries and souvenir stores serving tourists.\n\nThe Taiwanese version of pineapple tart is known as \"fènglísū\" (鳳梨酥). The filling is fully enclosed within a rectangular tart. Generally the taste is sweet due to sugar added. However, many bakers add or even substitute pineapple with winter melon to make the jam less tart as well giving a less fibrous texture to the filling.\n\nIn Australia the term often refers to a variation on the Neenish Tart, with pineapple jam below the filling, and passionfruit icing.\n\n"}

This cake is popular in Indonesia, and called as \"\"kue kaak\"\".\n\nKa'ak can refer to a bread commonly consumed throughout the Near East that is made in a large ring-shape and is covered with sesame seeds. Fermented chickpeas are used as a leavening agent. Widely sold by street vendors, it is usually eaten as a snack or for breakfast with za'atar. In East Jerusalem, it's sometimes served alongside oven-baked eggs and falafel. Palestinians from Hebron to Jenin consider Jerusalem ka'ak to be a unique specialty good, and those from the city or visiting there often buy several loaves to give to others outside the city as a gift.\n\nIn Lebanon, ka'ak bread rings are made of sweet dough rolled into ropes and formed into rings and topped with sesame seeds. Instead of za'atar, after baking, it is glazed with milk and sugar and then dried. Tunisian Jews also make a slightly sweet-and-salty version of the pastry, but don't use a yeast-based dough. In Egypt, usually at wedding parties, a variation made with almonds, known as \"kahk bi loz\", is served.\n\nA thirteenth-century Middle Eastern culinary text, \"Kitab al Wusla il al Habib\", features three recipes of ka'ak.\n\nThe pastries or sweets known as ka'ak are semolina-based cookies such as \"ka'ak bi ma'moul\" (or \"ka'ak bi ajwa\") which is stuffed with ground dates, \"ka'ak bi jowz\" which is stuffed with ground walnuts and \"ka'ak bi fustok\" which is stuffed with ground pistachios.\n\nKa'ak are popularly served for Eid al-Fitr and Easter in Egypt, where they are known as kahk. Kahk are coated in powdered sugar and filled with \"‘agameya\" (عجمية, a mixture of honey, nuts, and ghee), lokum, walnuts, pistachios, or dates, or simply served plain. They are also decorated with intricate designs. Egyptians have made kahk since the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, 3500 years ago.\n\nArab Christians, primary among them Palestinian Christians (including those who live in the Palestinian diaspora) and Lebanese Christians, make these sweets to celebrate Easter. The pastries are often shaped as wreaths and symbolize the crown of thorns that Christians believe Jesus Christ was wearing on the day of his crucifixion.\n\nFor the Muslim feasts during Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, ka'ak bi ma'moul is a traditional dessert as well. In Gaza, when a neighbour sends a dish filled with food to your house as is often the case during the holidays, it is customary to return the dish filled with food of your own making, and most commonly with ka'ak bi ajwa. The ka'ak sweets are also made year round among the entire Palestinian population and flour is sometimes substituted for semolina.\n\n\"Ka'ak al-asfar\" (\"the yellow roll\") is a cake of bread that is made by Muslims in the Levant to honour the souls of the departed. Traditionally, this bread, stamped with an elaborate geometric design, was distributed along with dried fruit to the poor, to children, and to relatives, by the family of the deceased on the Thursday and Monday following the death and on a day known as \"Khamis al-Amwat\" (\"Thursday of the Dead\"). A bread stamp that was used to imprint designs on these cakes was discovered in Palestine and dates back to the fourteenth or fifteenth century CE. It is round, with a round handle and geometric designs, and measures 19 centimeters in diameter.\n\nKa'ak sweets made by Iraqis are generally doughnut-shaped and covered in sesame seeds, such as \"ka'ak ab sumsum\" and \"ka'ak eem tzmukin\", which has raisins among other ingredients. \"Ka'ak beharat oo tefach\" shares the shape and many of the same ingredients as ka'ak eem tzmukin, but substitutes apples for raisins and is coated in almonds instead of sesame seeds.\n\n\n"}

Frequently the eggplant is baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste. Baba ghanoush is usually eaten as a dip with pita bread, and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is usually of an earthy light brown color. In Ethiopia, this dish is commonly known as \"blagadoush\".\nSimilar to baba ghanoush is another Levantine dish \"mutabbal\" (متبل lit. 'spiced'), which also includes mashed cooked aubergines and tahini, and mixed with salt, pepper, olive oil, and anar seeds. Mutabbal is sometimes said to be a spicier version of baba ghanoush.\nIn Turkey, a similar meze is called \"patlıcan salatası\" (\"eggplant salad\"). It is made with grilled mashed eggplant, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic; sometimes, tahini, chopped tomato and green pepper as well. More frequently, eggplant is mixed with yoghurt, olive oil and garlic. The version with cut eggplants can be found in southern Turkey, especially in Antakya. In other varieties, called \"şakşuka\" or \"köpoğlu\", roasted and chopped eggplants and peppers are served with garlic yogurt or tomato sauce. The latter is also a typical eggplant appetizer in Bulgaria, where it is called \"kyopolou\". \"Hünkarbeğendi\" is another Turkish dish, which is a mutton or lamb (nowadays also veal) stew where the meat is served hot on a bed of eggplant purée. The purée also contains \"kaşar\" cheese, milk and flour.\n\nIn Armenia the dish is known as \"mutabal\". The essential ingredients in Armenian mutabal are eggplant, tahini, garlic, lemon, and onion; and most Armenians also add cumin.\nGeorgian \"badrijnis khizilala\" (\"aubergine caviar\") is made of fried and chopped eggplants. Further typical ingredients are onions, garlic, pomegranate, hot red pepper, vegetable oil and fresh green cilantro.\n\nIn Israel, the traditional version called \"salat ḥatzilim\" is made with mashed grilled aubergines, tahina, olive oil, lemon, garlic and parsley.

In other countries of Western Balkans (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia) it is prepared from green peppers and eggplant.\n\n\"Salată de vinete\" (Eggplant salad) or simply \"vinete\" is both a Romanian and Hungarian mashed eggplant salad made of grilled, peeled and finely chopped eggplants, sunflower oil and chopped onions. The eggplants are grilled on an open flame until they are covered with black ash crust. The crust is cleaned off and the remaining cooked eggplant is mashed with a blunt, thick wooden cleaver (knife) on a wooden platter (popular belief has it that using a metal knife will turn the eggplant flesh black, before stainless steel blades, but also because cutting through the seeds is to be avoided). The eggplant mash is mixed in a bowl, stirring continuously, with sunflower oil, chopped onions and salt. The mix is beaten vigorously. Crushed garlic and ground pepper may be added too. Instead of oil, mayonnaise can be used, although not traditionally. A zest of lemon is added at the end and the platter is sometimes garnished with tomato slices.\n\nA typical zakuska in Russia and Ukraine is known as \"baklažannaja ikra\" (, \"aubergine caviar\"). Some versions add chopped tomatoes to the basic recipe. Another eggplant salad popular in Russia is called \"he iz baklažanov\" (Russian: \"хе из баклажанов\"), and it is probably influenced by Korean cuisine. Eggplant \"he\" is based on julienned (instead of mashed) cooked aubergines and other vegetables, prepared with concentrated vinegar. After adding the vinegar, it is set aside for several hours to cure before eating.\n\nIn Indian and Pakistani cuisine, an eggplant dish, by the name of \"baingan bartha\", is popular especially in the regions of Punjab, Maharashtra, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. It is also eaten across Pakistan, as well as in Bangladesh. The dish has many names, depending on the local language (Hindi: \"baingan ka bharta\", \"begun bhôrta\", Marathi: \"wangyacha bharit\").\nIn the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Tamils prepare \"kathrikai thayir kothsu\", in which the eggplant is cooked, mashed and sautéed with mustard, red chili peppers, and sesame oil, after which yogurt is added to the mixture and dressed with cilantro coriander leaves. It is often eaten with an Indian flatbread (specifically roti or paratha), and is also served with rice, and/or raita (a yoghurt salad).\n\nKashmiris prepare a spicy and tangy dish of eggplants called \"choek wangun\" with tamarind constituting an important part of the gravy.\n\nEggplant mud (茄泥) is a Chinese recipe of steamed and mashed eggplant. It is served with dressings such as pounded garlic with soy sauce. In Sichuan cuisine many people also like to add hot peppers and cilantro. It is a common lunch dish and may be eaten with rice or rolls.\n\nMashed eggplant is also part of Hmong cuisine and it contains hot peppers and cilantro.\n\nIn Korea, steamed or poached strips of eggplant seasoned with garlic, toasted sesame oil and chili is a common side dish called 가지나물 (gaji namul, literally “eggplant salad.”)\n\n\"Caviar d'aubergine\" is prepared in southern France. Baked, peeled aubergine is mixed with garlic, tomato, parsley, lemon juice, and finally olive oil. It is served as an appetizer with French bread, possibly along with olive tapenade.\n\n\"Caponata\" is a Sicilian eggplant relish made from chopped fried vegetables (mostly eggplants and peppers), seasoned with celery, olives and capers, in a sweet sour sauce. Today, caponata is typically used as a side dish or appetizer, but, since the 18th century, it has sometimes been used as a main course.\n\n\"Berenjena a la vinagreta\" is a typical appetizer in Hispanosphere made from boiled eggplants in a vinaigrette. The eggplant is usually salted to remove moisture then boiled until soft and then placed into a vinaigrette with garlic and various herbs or spices. In Argentina the eggplants will rest in the vinaigrette, often containing plenty of oil, for several days and then is eaten as part of a picada before a meal. In Spain it can be found along other pinchos at tapas bars. In Catalonia region, eggplant is roasted and seasoned with olive oil in the dish escalivada.\n\nIn the 1973 Soviet film comedy \"\" which partly takes place in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, a lavish royal banquet features several tub-sized bowls of genuine sturgeon caviar and red caviar, and a tiny golden dish of \"eggplant caviar from overseas\".

It is roasted over charcoal while basted with melted butter, until its surface cooks to a golden-brown color. During the baking process the sugar stuck on the ' caramelises and forms a shiny, crispy crust. The surface of the cake can then be topped with additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon.\n\nThe etymology of the name refers to a stovepipe, since the fresh, steaming cake in the shape of a truncated cone resembles a hot chimney.\n\nThis opinion is shared by , scholar and philologist from Kolozsvár (Cluj): \"...When cake is taken off from the spit in one piece, it gets the shape of a long vent or tube. Since cake preserves shape when served for both family and guests, consumers are faced with this typical, vent-like image of cake tearing off in strips. It is obvious that \"etymology must be closely related to the vent shape of cake\".\n\nThroughout the centuries, miscellaneous alternate names and spellings of \"kürtőskalács\" have been used. More references were mentioned even in the 19th century (e.g. dorongfánk/spit-donut or botratekercs/stick roll-up or botfánk/stick-donut). The name \"kürtőskalács\" has a Transylvanian origin and became popular only by the middle of the 20th century. Until the end of the century it had different spellings (e.g. spelt with ‘ö’ as in ‘kürtös kalács’ or in two words, as in ‘kürtős kalács’. As far as we know the present name, \"kürtőskalács\", first appeared in a cookbook, published by the book department of 'Brassói Lapok’ (Transylvanian gazette of the time) in 1926.\n\nThe International Kürtőskalács Trade Corporation has taken measures to have kürtőskalács registered as Hungarian product by the European Union.\n\nThe first known record that hints at a family of cakes baked by rotating spit over cinders dates back to Medieval times (about 1450) and is found in a manuscript from Heidelberg. The description mentions a strip of raised dough that has to be wound in a helix shape around a baking spit, and brushed with egg yolk before baking.\n\nIn the 16th century, the evolution of the cake family proceeded in three branches. The first branch contains pastries that preserved the image of cake similar to the one mentioned above, with a strip wound on spit in a helical shape. The Szekler-Hungarian kürtőskalács, \"Skalicky trdelnik\" (trdelník from Skalica), and the Czech-Moravian \"trdlo/trdelnice/trdelnik\", which is virtually the same as the latter, as well as the \"kürtősfánk\" (kürtősh donut) belong to this branch. The second branch has pastries made from batter, namely the Lithuanian \"raguolis\" and \"šakotis\", Polish \"sękacz\", the French \"gateau a la broche\", the German \"Baumkuchen\", the Austrian \"Prügertorte\" and \"Prügelkrapfen\" as well as the Swedish \"Spettekaka\". The third branch is represented by one cake, the Transylvanian-Saxon \"Baumstriezel\", where a continuous dough strip is placed on a spit.\n\nThe first known recipe of Kürtőskalács originates from Transylvania, included in the 1784 cookbook of Countess Mária Mikes of Zabola (\"‘kürtős kaláts’ à la Mrs. Poráni\"). It makes no mention, however, of sweetening of any kind in the preparation. A recipe from the cookbook written by Kristóf Simai in 1795 in Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) first mentioned \"sweetening subsequent to baking\". \"Trdelnik from Skalica\" is based on similar preparation, with the cake surface covered in chopped nuts (e.g. walnut, almond) before baking, and sugar that is added only subsequent to baking.\n\nAlmost 100 years passed before the first mention was made of the next step in the evolution of kürtőskalács, the appearance of a caramelized sugar glaze, in \"Aunt Rézi’s Cookbook\" written by Terézia Dolecskó in 1876, published in Szeged, Hungary. The recipe suggests \"sprinkling sugar (sugar almond) on dough on spit a priory to baking\". Due to the heat, the sugar is caramelized and also enters in what is known as Maillard reaction. The sugar glaze that melts to become caramel forms a continuous coat, also adds to firmness of cake. Shortly afterwards, pure sugar (not almond sugar) was applied to the dough's surface before baking, even with the omission of sweetening subsequent to baking. Ágnes Zilahi’s cookbook entitled \"Valódi Magyar szakácskönyv\" (The Real Hungarian Cookbook), which appeared in Budapest in 1892, presents such a recipe.\n\nThe first mention of additional toppings applied to the caramel glaze appears in \"Rézi néni szakácskönyve (Aunt Rézi’s Cookbook)\". The use of ground, chopped or candied walnuts applied as an additional topping became popular only in the late 20th century. As far as we know Pál Kövi’s cookbook, \"Erdélyi lakoma\" (Transylvanian Feast), which came out in 1980, seems to be the first source with the tip of applying this type of topping. The wide spectrum of cinnamon, coconut, cocoa, etc. toppings started to receive wide application only at the end of the century.\n\nThe current, most frequently baked variant of kürtőskalács evolved in Szeklerland in the first half of the 20th century. It is specific to this variant that the surface of the raw dough wrapped around the spit flattens out by the usual procedure of rolling it on a flat surface sprinkled with granulated sugar. By this procedure the layers of dough wrapped around the spit are pressed together, rendering the cake smoother, more compact in structure and more elegant. The first written record of this technique appears in the cookbook of Mrs. Zathureczky, née Manci Zlech, which was published in Barót between 1934 and 1943. The cookbook, entitled \"Erdélyi ízek\" (\"Flavors of Transylvania\"), which appeared in Csíkszereda (Szeklerburg/Miercurea-Ciuc), published by Proprint Press in 2007, gives a recipe of this sort.\n\nKürtőskalács became popular among the Hungarian nobility at the beginning of the 18th century. One hint at an Austrian or German origin is the fact that a conservative Transylvanian nobleman, Péter Apor, in his work \"Metamorphosis Transylvaniae\" does not mention Kürtőskalács in the list of traditional Hungarian foods, for all the evidence we have about the cake already existing in his wife's cuisine. In a letter from a mother superior in Moldavia addressed to Mrs Péter Apor, née Borbála Kálnoki, the writer asks Mrs. Apor to have a butler of hers taught the art of baking kürtőslalács: \"Honored mother Superior prays you if she could send you a butler in the hope perchance you spare no pain and teach him kindly some art of baking kürtőslalács withal others\".\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, kürtőskalács had become popular in all Hungarian speaking regions as a defining element of both urban and rustic cuisine. In the first volume of \"A Székelyföld leírása\" (Description of the Szeklerland) from 1868, Balázs Orbán writes about the genesis legend of Udvarhelyszék, which holds that the Szeklers, chased into caves and later blockaded by the Tatars, eventually made the enemy leave by presenting them a huge kürtőskalács made of straw which they held out of the cave to show they had supplies to endure the siege. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the recipe of the cake was recorded in numerous popular cookbooks.\n\nAs a result of urbanization at the beginning of the 20th century, kürtőskalács was replaced by newer cakes. But on the eastern periphery of the Hungarian speaking regions, in the Szeklerland, the open fireplace survived to the end of the 19th century, and consequently, kürtőskalács has been preserved as a living tradition on regions dwelt by Szeklers. Up to the present kürtőskalács baked above cinders is regarded as immanent to the Transylvanian wedding menu.\n\nFollowing the change of regime in 1989, kürtőskalács became the traditional local treat offered to Hungarian tourists visiting Szekler villages and thus an element of the international image of both the Szeklerland and Transylvania. This gastronomic tradition, which earlier had been preserved merely in rural Szekler communities, gradually found its way back to the culture of the Hungarian elite, mainly due to tourism. By the middle of the 1990s, kürtőskalács became popular in most cities in Hungary, and tourists visiting Hungary reported on \"the gorgeous, sweet, tubular treat\" with admiration.\nBecause of international migrations and tourism, however, kürtőskalács is also no longer regarded as a solely Szekler or Hungarian symbol, but rather as representative of European gastronomy.\n\nThree variants of kürtőskalács can be distinguished, which are nonetheless, manufactured in a similar way.\n\nThe recipe of the traditional, homemade variant became standardized at the beginning of the 20th century. The ingredients are firmly specified and it is usually baked above cinders. The essential ingredients are exclusively: sugar, wheat flour, butter, milk, eggs, yeast and salt. Additional toppings are restricted to ground or chopped walnut, almond, cinnamon powder or vanilla sugar made from natural vanilla powder.\n\nVariants at carnivals became popular in the late 20th century. With this variant, the recipe is more flexible so that it can be manufactured in smaller, mobile places, rendering it much cheaper. In this variant, butter can be replaced by vegetable oil or margarine, and milk by milk powder. Moreover, eggs can be replaced by egg powder or liquid eggs, but this ingredient can also be omitted. In exchange, grated lemon zest, natural citrus extract or citrus juice, rum or vanilla sugar powder can be added to the dough. The surface can be provided any additional topping that bears flavor and aroma.\n\nFurther alternative variants appeared at the beginning of the 21st century. These recipe can be even more flexible. The dough can be made of non–wheat flour. The inner, tubular part can be also given an additional coating, and it can abound in other natural ingredients (e.g. pieces of fruit). Alternative kürtőskalács can be prepared gluten free as well. A cake that lacks ingredients of animal origin (milk, butter, eggs) can be labeled as ‘Vegan’ or ‘Lent’.\n\nKürtősfánk (Kürtősh Donut) is a similar-shaped cake, which is baked in oil or fat and topped with sugar after baking or stuffed with whipped cream.\n\nKürtőskalács is made of a relatively hard and dry yeast-dough. A \"twine\" of dough is wrapped around the length of the spit, and then the spit with the strip of dough on it is rolled in sugar. Before or during baking, it's brushed with melted butter. The cake is ready when its surface has an even, brownish–red color. Strictly, homemade kürtőskalács can be made exclusively from natural ingredients (flour, sugar, milk, butter, eggs, yeast and salt). For other variants, of all ingredients it is merely margarine and vanilla sugar powder that can be synthetic, including ingredients of the final topping.\n\nKürtőskalács can be enriched by further aromas and flavors if the completed cake is provided a final topping. Any topping can be used\nthat does not contain salt, cheese, meat or other non-confectionery ingredients.\n\nAmong pastries that are most closely related to kürtőskalács, the Transylvanian Saxon Baumstriezel has a cylinder shape, rather than a helix. Skalicky Trdelnik from Slovakia (formerly Upper Hungary), as well as Trdlo/Trdelnice/Trdelnik from the Czech–Moravian region, differ from kürtőskalács in that there is no caramel sugar glaze applied to their surface.\n\nNeighboring nations have their own names for the cake. Amongst Saxons, who earlier dwelt in Transylvania, the literal translation of the word kürtőskalács, i.e. Schornsteinkuchen, became popular. Poles and Romanians use both the phonetic transcription of the word kürtőskalács and the translation of the adjective – noun cluster of \"magyar kalács\"/Hungarian Kalách or \"székely kalács\"/Szekler Kalách (Kurtoszkalacz or \"Wegierski kolacz\" and respectively \"Colac Secuiesc\" or \"Cozonac Secuiesc\"). Other languages use either a phonetic transcription of the entire compound word (Kurtosh Kalach), or a phonetic transcription of the cluster’s first element, i.e. ‘kürtős’ – Kurtosh followed by a translation of its second element, 'kalács', \"cake\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16422760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16422760", "title": "Ukrainian folklore", "text": "Ukrainian folklore\n\nUkrainian folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Ukraine and among ethnic Ukrainians. The earliest examples of folklore found in Ukraine is the layer of pan-Slavic folklore that dates back to the ancient Slavic mythology of the Eastern Slavs. Gradually, Ukrainians developed a layer of their own distinct folk culture. Folklore has been an important tool in defining and retaining a cultural distinctiveness in Ukraine in the face of strong assimilatory pressures from neighboring lands.\n\nUkrainian folk customs have numerous layers defined by the period in which that aspect developed and the area in which it was exploited. The lowest and oldest level is the pan-Slavic layer of folk culture which has many elements that are common to the Slavic people in general. Above that are elements common to the Eastern Slavs, and above that are elements found only in Ukraine itself. The layer above this contains cultural and folkloric elements that define the various micro-groups of the Ukrainian ethos such as the Boykos, Hutsuls, Lemkos, Lyshaks, Podolians and Rusyns.\n\nSome features of Ukrainian folklore are quite distinctive from that of the neighbouring Slavic peoples. The songs and festivities of Ivana Kupala (St John's Feast) and the Koliada normally associated with some of the deepest and most ancient levels of folklore contain features not found in the neighbouring Russian culture, and are distinctively Ukrainian. These elements put into a quandary the notion that the ethnic Russian and Ukrainian people sprang from one source.\n\nIn Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada, the Livery Barn has some traditional Eastern European food and some perogies and gravy and some added water. \n\nUkrainian folk customs and rites were rituals connected with the calendar and with the course of human life. They were often accompanied by religious ceremonies, incantations, folk songs, dances, and dramatic plays. Life cycle rituals mark birth, marriage, and death. Many of these customs are ancient and have blended in many cases with Christian rites. They can be divided into three categories:\n\nFolk customs have undergone many changes in Ukraine as modern culture was introduced. Under the Soviets, folk customs were unsuccessfully suppressed. Believers still practiced the Christian customs, and some people in the country even revived the ancient customs and rites. Many Christian rites have been revived in post-Soviet Ukraine after 1991, especially in western oblasts.\n\nDance has existed in Ukraine as a ritual since ancient times, but it was mostly absorbed by Christianity and blended with Christian rituals. The earliest dances were circle dances concerned with agriculture. Dances took place on Ivan Kupala day, St. George's day, Pentecost, days of harvest, and weddings. Ritual dances were rarely performed to music, and usually to a chant. Folk dances were performed with or without music. The majority of Ukrainian folk dances are circular. Some of the most famous dances are the Arkan and Hopak. Dance was also enriched with traditional Ukrainian folk dress. Today many Ukrainian dance groups exist in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora, particularly in Canada, and have kept the tradition of folk dancing alive.\n\nUkrainian folk songs can be divided into four basic groups:\n\nUkrainian folk songs contain an abundance of symbolism. Bird symbolism is popular. The eagle or falcon is the symbol of manliness, power, beauty, courage, and freedom. The dove symbolizes femininity. The sea gull is the symbol of the suffering mother. Other symbols include the viburnum opulus or guelder-rose (\"kalyna\"), which represents a beloved girl or Ukraine itself, and the oak which represents the boy. In songs similes predominate: a girl is compared to a star, a red guelder-rose tree, a pine tree, and a poppy; a boy is compared to an oak, a maple, and a pigeon. Some songs make use of repetition, antithesis, hyperbole, and metaphor. A technique often used in lyrical songs to express emotion is the dramatic dialogue. In some folk songs assonance, alliteration, and onomatopoeia are also used.\n\nFolk songs have provided inspiration for many Ukrainian composers, such as Mykola Lysenko, Mykola Leontovych, and Kyrylo Stetsenko. The famous Russian composers Peter Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Serge Rachmaninoff also collected and used Ukrainian folk melodies in their works. Today many folk songs are still used, and are even used by contemporary artists.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16435920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16435920", "title": "Sfenj", "text": "Sfenj\n\nSfenj (from the Arabic word , meaning sponge) is a Maghrebi doughnut: a light, spongy ring of dough fried in oil. Sfenj is eaten plain, sprinkled with sugar, or soaked in honey. It is a well-known dish in the Maghreb and is traditionally made and sold early in the morning for breakfast or in the late afternoon accompanied by tea—usually Maghrebi mint tea—or coffee. It is also called \"Khfaf\" in Algeria and other parts of the Maghreb, \"bambalouni\" in Tunisia, and \"sfinz\" in \"Libya\". Outside the Maghreb, sfenj is often eaten by Moroccan Jews and other Sephardim in Israel and elsewhere for Hanukkah. Sfenj and other doughnuts are eaten for Hanukkah because they are fried in oil, commemorating the Hanukkah miracle wherein the oil that was supposed to light the lamp in the Temple in Jerusalem for only one day lasted for eight. Though sfenj can be made at home, as it usually is in Israel, Moroccans almost always opt to purchase it from street vendors or bakeries, where they are commonly strung on palm fronds.\n\nSfenj originated in Al-Andalus, otherwise known as Muslim Spain. According to legend, sfenj was created by mistake, when a baker accidentally dropped a ball of dough into a pan of hot oil. Sfenj was an important part of Andalusi culture, whose role was best summarized by a verse from a contemporary poet: \"The sfenj bakers are worth as much as kings\" (\"سفاجين تحسبهم ملوكا\").\n\nIt is unclear how sfenj first spread to the Maghreb, although it was well known to the Banumarin dynasty, who ruled Morocco from 1270 to 1465. It also spread to France during the 13th century, where it inspired beignets.\n\nThough sfenj comes from Al-Andalus, most bakers and sellers of sfenj in the Maghreb have traditionally been Amazigh (Berbers). From Morocco, the nomadic Amazigh spread sfenj to Tunisia and then to Algeria. It was introduced to Algeria by Tunisian merchants, leading Algerians to call the dessert \"\"at-tunisi\"\" (التونسي, literally \"the Tunisian\").\n\nDedicated sfenj bakers, called \"sufnāj\" (), soon appeared throughout the Maghreb, attesting to the dessert's popularity. \"Sufnājeen\" (plural of \"sufnāj\") became central figures in the social life of Maghrebi neighborhoods, as they interacted with almost every household in their community every morning, and working as a \"sufnāj\" was considered a respectable career. In a traditional sfenj bakery, the \"sufnāj\" (and their large circular fryer) sit on an elevated platform, raised slightly above the rest of the bakery, which is already raised more than a meter off the ground. Customers surround this platform and try to catch the \"sufnāj\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> attention to place their orders by raising their hand at him or her in a manner reminiscent of the Nazi salute and shouting. For this reason, \"sufnājeen\" are often nicknamed \"Hitler\" (هتلر).\n\nTraditional \"sufnājeen\" are quickly going extinct in the modern Maghreb, as a result of the rise of industrial bakeries and the proliferation of sfenj recipes over the Internet.\n\nSfenj were only sweetened with sugar starting in the 18th century, even though sugarcane has been widely cultivated in the Arab world since the 8th century. Before that, they were sweetened with honey or syrup, or simply served plain.\n\nSfenj entered Israeli culture before 1948, as Moroccan Jews brought it with them when they immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. Sfenj quickly became popular for Hanukkah, as it is easy to prepare at home. However, sfenj's ease of preparation contributed to its loss of popularity in Israel. During the late 1920s, the Histadrut, Israel's national labor union, pushed to make the jelly-filled sufganiyah the traditional food of Hanukkah. Making sufganiyot well can only be done by professional bakers, and the Histadrut wanted sufganiyot to supplant sfenj in order to secure jobs for Jewish bakers. Their effort was successful: by 2016, Israel's 7 million Jews were eating 20 million sufganiyot per year, while few Israelis of non-Moroccan origin eat sfenj. More Israeli Jews report eating sufganiyot for Hanukkah than fasting for Yom Kippur.\n\nIn addition to ordinary sfenj, there are two special varieties of sfenj, not counting the different toppings (honey, syrup, and sugar) sfenj can have:\n\n\nSfenj's importance to Moroccan culture is reflected in several idioms in Moroccan Arabic, including:\n\n"}

The original SF-36 stemmed from the Medical Outcome Study, MOS, which was conducted by the RAND Corporation. Since then a group of researchers from the original study released a commercial version of SF-36 while the original SF-36 is available in public domain license free from RAND. A shorter version is the SF-12. If having only adequate physical and mental health summary scores is of interest, \"then the SF12 may be the instrument of choice\".\n\nThe SF-36 and RAND-36 include the same set of items that were developed in the Medical Outcomes Study. Scoring of the general health and pain scales is different between the versions. The differences in scoring are summarized by Hays, Sherbourne, and Mazel (Health Economics, 2: 217-227, 1993).\n\nThe SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.

The majority decision delivered by Justice Stevens upheld an order from the 8th Circuit Court that the diet be discontinued.\n\nThe standards of the American Correctional Association, which accredits prisons, discourage the use of food as a disciplinary measure, but adherence to the organization's food standards is voluntary. Denying inmates food as punishment has been found to be unconstitutional by the courts, but because the loaf is generally nutritionally complete, it is sometimes justified as a \"dietary adjustment\" rather than a denial of proper meals.\n\nLawsuits regarding nutraloaf have taken place in several states, including Illinois, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia. In March 2008, prisoners brought their case before the Vermont Supreme Court, arguing that since Vermont state law does not allow food to be used as punishment, nutraloaf must be removed from the menu. The Vermont Supreme Court held that nutraloaf and water diet constitutes punishment as it was designed to be unappetizing and as such compelled their conclusion. In April 2010, sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona won a federal judgment in favor of the constitutionality of nutraloaf. In December 2015, New York State decided to discontinue the use of nutraloaf throughout prisons statewide. In \"Gordon v. Barnett\", the District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled that although it was not cruel and unusual, nutraloaf is a punishment and that prisoners are entitled to a due process hearing before being subjected to it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16744822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16744822", "title": "Esnaf", "text": "Esnaf\n\nEsnaf is a Turkish word which means “guild” or “corporation”. During the Early Modern Period belonging to a guild gave people a voice and was an important part of one's identity. Handicraft producers were linked to one another by a range of social, political, and economic ties. Guilds varied among societies, social class, and genders. There were many misconceptions, differences, as well as similarities between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. There were hierarchies within guilds; sometimes they shared tools, worked together, or worked alone.\n\nIn the Early Modern Period, collective identity was mainly established by normative framework, but was also a result of the process of interaction itself, and could be manipulated according to the circumstances. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Islamic state created a system, based upon an open- minded interpretation of Islam’s attitude toward rival monotheists that allowed inclusion for the Christians and Jews who populated the conquered lands of Anatolia and the Balkans. The uprising of Istanbul in 1651 was a successful protest against dominant authority. The people marched on the palace and got a powerful religious leader on their side in order to get the vizier to step down. They made their voices heard as a group within their guild, and gave people a sense of pride to belong to a guild. Economic activity within guilds was controlled by political powers.\n\nContrary to general assumption, even in the highly segmented world of the Early Modern Period, trading Diasporas did not simply act as middlemen within dominant societies, but also developed durable commercial ties with other merchant groups outside any institutional structure. Not all workers were equal among guilds; many of them had hierarchies which varied among different regions. “There might be four or five different shoemakers”. Being a part of a guild was a great way for people to create compositions; it became a major part of one's identity. It was assumed that guilds declined due to repressed innovations but in all truth guilds declined mainly due to political issues. Political authorities were very much a part of production within guilds and controlled all economic factors involved. The prosperity and commercial success of merchants were both a cause and consequence of their domination of urban politics. Guilds are often associated with the medieval times in nature but guilds have been along for a long time; even prior the medieval era. Guilds are often associated with Europe only as well, but in fact guilds were a massive part of the Ottoman Empire too. Guilds within the Ottoman Empire and Europe had both their similarities and differences.\n\nMetal products created a significant share of the goods handled by European merchants; but their most important commodities were raw and finished cloth. Guilds were mainly male dominated but wives and servants still played an important role in production. In some cases woman could even hold formal positions and widows could inherit. Stocking knitting became a common livelihood for the poor in numerous parts of Europe, because it required more or less no capital investment; knitters would use yearn from their own sheep or yarn given by merchants. All social classes were allowed, but there still was an evident hierarchy within the guilds. Although, religion was more exclusive; therefore Jews were marginalized. Europe was a very spiritual economy meaning people took care of each other and would help when one another when they could. For example, there were charitable services. Around 1560, Antwerp reached its peak of its success just before the revolt of the Netherlands.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire many young woman were hired to unwind cocoon, spin silk threads, and weave. Also, there were many woman groups outside of guilds such as cloth makers. Woman would exchange good among each other within female markets. In the late sixteenth century estates of peasant woman living near Konya and owning some jewellery have been stumbled upon, which indicates market links.\n\nGuilds were a major part of an economy that was very state dominated like the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman dynasty, especially along its seaboards and borderlands opportunities of commerce tended to diversify economies and put together sundry people and ideas. The Ottoman society was extremely mixed main due to conquest and immigration; therefore there was a vast number of religion and Jews were very much included. The Ottoman society was a spiritual economy but not as much as Europe. This was mainly because the Ottoman Empire was mixed religiously meaning there were many different religions mixed within guilds.\n\nGuilds were an urban phenomenon. The Ottomans had politics as much as commerce in mind when they negotiated and dispersed capitulations. The Ottoman- Venetian conflicts led to international commerce booms in Dubrovnik, Florence, Ancona, and Genoa. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries Florence, Genoa, and Venice vied for control of Ottoman markets and merchandises. Primarily in the north and east, Muslim traders dominated several Ottoman exchanges and some international routes. There were links between cities and the countryside; although, direct commercial exchanges were probably the exception rather than the rule. The Empire was separated into zones so that civilians were limited to buying only from the source that they had been assigned to.\n\nIn small towns, craft structures might be reasonably simple, for example, with one type or a few types at the most of tailors who made up fabrics into ready to wear clothing; but large cities producers were highly specialized. Different guilds often produced similar goods. “Collective workshops were considered more desirable by more substantial craftsmen themselves”. This would make collective workshops a suitable means of social control. Every member was monitored very closely; there were influential members but no one completely controlled the productivity of other fellow members. Partnerships existed, although it’s unknown how common partnerships occurred. A more modern type of labor division also existed during the Early Modern Period. During this time bleachers, twisters, and dyers craftsmen not only owned their own equipment but their own shops as well. A compound product such as silk may go through the hands of many different craftsmen prior to reaching the consumer.\n\n\n"}

Placing the two balls of dough one on top of the other so that the top one does not fall off during the baking process is part of the art and challenge that must be mastered by the baker. Traditionally, this type of zwieback is baked Saturday and eaten Sunday morning and for afternoon \"Faspa\" (Standard German: \"Vesper\"), a light meal.\n\nThis zwieback originated in the port cities of the Netherlands or Danzig, where toasted, dried buns were used to provision ships. Mennonite immigrants from the Netherlands, who settled in around Danzig in West Prussia continued this practice and brought it to Russia, when they migrated to new colonies in what is today Ukraine.\n\nTraditionally, zwieback are made using lard instead of butter or a mixture of the two. As such, zwieback is very rich and does not need butter when being eaten, although jelly or jam both go quite well. Many zwieback recipes do not use modern units of measurement, instead relying on anecdotal measurements handed down through the generations. The following recipe is a translation of a traditional recipe using modern measurements:\n\n\"Scald 2 cups of milk and 3/4 cup shortening (butter or lard, or 1/2 each) in a small saucepan. Cool to body temperature then add 2 tbsp. yeast. In separate mixing bowl, sift 3 cups of flour, then add 2 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. sugar. Add milk mixture to flour. Mix well, then add additional flour and kneed. The dough should be slightly softer than bread dough, and not sticky (approx. 5 cups of flour). Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size or more, about an hour. Form dough into small balls the size of a walnut, placing one dough ball on top of another to form a snowman shape; the ball on the top should be slightly smaller than the one on the bottom. Let them rise again, around 30 min.. Bake in a hot oven at 410ºF for 20-25 min or until bottoms are golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.\"\n\n"}

It is named after Dong'an County. It is one of the signature dishes of Hunan chefs.\n\nDongan Chicken is a classic Hunan dish. Its cooking method originated from Dong'an County, Hunan Province. According to legend, as early as the first year of Tang Xuanzong, Dong'an people began to make vinegar chicken. The vinegar chicken was renamed Dong'an Chicken in two ways: One said that because of the Xiang military commander in the late Qing Dynasty, Dong Baoan Shi Baotian often named the dish as a dinner party; another said that after the victory of the Northern Expedition, the Eighth Army of the National Revolutionary Army The military commander, Tang Shengzhi, hosted a banquet in Nanjing. The meal was accompanied by a dish of vinegar and chicken. The guest praised the guests. The guests asked about the name of the dish. Tang Shengzhi felt that the original name was indecent and he had a move. He said that he was Dong'an chicken in his hometown. \n\nDong'an chicken has experienced the evolution of three dynasties: In the Western Jin Dynasty, it was called \"Vinegar Chicken.\" In the Western Jin Dynasty; Huiyi Yonghee first year (290) established a county government on the shore of Yingshui, called Yingyang County (now Luhong Town). At that time, he was appointed as the county magistrate and held a grand celebration ceremony. He called the villagers to come and congratulate him. He invited the local chef to scoop the spoon and feast. According to the customs at that time, the regular banquet reached the fifth course was chicken, called \"chicken opening.\" That time the \"chicken mouth\" tasted a little bit sour. The acid and sourness opened up the diners' appetites. After the party was seated, the county commander called the chef and asked him how he thought to season vinegar in the chicken. The chef was busy kneeling on the floor and said, “I don’t mean to be guilty. I was not deliberate. I was very anxious at the time and wrongly put my vinegar into my wine. In order to remove vinegar, I immediately added some pepper and ginger. Let the adults sin!” The prefecture laughed and said happily: “What sins are it! Get up! Everyone says that the vinegar chicken is delicious! I told you to come to honor you!” Who knows? Coincidence actually created a famous dish. Since then, the practice of \"vinegar chicken\" has spread among the people.\n\nAt the end of the Qing Dynasty, it was called \"Official Protection of Chicken.\" In the last years of the Qing Dynasty, the Xiang army would take the chair Bao Tian because of the suppression of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the uprising of the Miao of Guizhou, and the Qing court seals Bao Shitian as the doctor of Guang Lu, and was awarded the title of “Prince Shao Shaobao”, which was highly valued by the court. In the late years, Bao Baotian was called sick and lived in Huaqiao. Once, Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Liu Kunyi waited for a visit to the seat of Shibao Tianjia and the boiler was filled with the “vinegar chicken”. In order to increase the umami taste, the family kitchen added some old milk curd sauce to the “vinegar chicken”. The \"vinegar chicken\" made was not only hot and sour but also crispy. When Zeng Guofan and others ate and praised him when Zuo Zongtang asked the name of the dish, Mr. Xi Baotian wanted to say “Vinegar Chicken,” but he couldn’t think of the name too. Zeng Guofan intervened and said: “This is a special product of the Xiguan Bao’ an family, and it is called 'guanbao chicken'!” Zuo Zongtang and Liu Kunyi accompanied and said: “Yeah! The name of the famous home will be famous, the official will protect the chicken, good name!” Since then, The dish was passed to the court.\n\nIn the Republic of China, it was called \"Dong'an Chicken.\" In the first phase of the Northern Expedition in 1926, Tang Shengzhi, a famous patriotic general of the Chinese Kuomintang, was the commander of the frontier enemy of the Northern Expedition. After the victory of the Northern Expedition, Tang Shengzhi settled in Nanjing. In order to celebrate the victory of the Northern Expedition, he hosted a banquet for his men and colleagues in Nanjing, and a “police officer” was placed between the banquets. His private chef is Wu Jiaqiao and he is more particular about cooking. The first choice of chicken must be a female chicken that has not had an egg and weighs no more than one and a half kilograms; the firepower is just right when it is produced, and the blood in the chicken bone is bright red; on the cutting edge method, a chicken is cut apart from the internal organs. Into sixteen, placed on a plate, is exactly a complete chicken. After his subordinates and colleagues had eaten, they all said that the dish was beautiful in appearance, bright in color, fresh in flesh, refreshing in sourness, fat, but not greasy, eating too much, scented, nutritious, sweet, sour, sour, spicy, Tender, crisp, and tasteful. Asked what the name of this dish was, Tang Shengzhi was about to open his mouth. Gu Boxu, next to him, reminded: “Hometown cuisine is hometown cuisine.” Tang Shengzhi immediately said: “This is our Dongan special dish called 'Dong'an Chicken'.” Tang Shengzhi’s diplomacy Hospitality often uses \"Dong'an Chicken\" as a pressing seat. Guo Moruo's \"Hong Bo Ji\" also records: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Tang Shengzhi hosted a banquet in the mansion of the Shui Lu State in Changsha. Among them, Dong Anji's dish taste was particularly good. In February 1972, when the U.S. president visited China, Mao Zedong hosted a dinner for Nixon and Dong'an chicken was also served during the dinner. Nixon praised while eating. After returning home, he also greatly appreciated the excellent taste of Dong'an Chicken. Soon came to Southeast Asia, North America, Jordan, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and other countries. Since then, Dong’an Chicken has been listed as a national feast and is the first of eight Hunan cuisines.\n"}

All of them use dough as the main ingredient, which is then decorated. This dough can be sweet or savoury. If it is sweet, eggs and sugar are added, and if it is savoury, yeast and salt. As regards the topping or filling, fish and vegetables are usual at the coast whilst inland they prefer fruit, nuts, cheese and meat. Some cocas can be both sweet and savoury (typically mixing meat and fruit).\n\nCoca is almost any kind of bread-based product. Its size can vary from 5 cm up to 1 metre. There are various presentations:\n\nAmongst the lengthy list of varieties, the most common are:\n\n\"Cocas are (...) strongly linked with our country's traditions.\" The coca is a dish common to rich and poor and a basic part of Catalan cuisine.\n\nIn Catalonia, the coca has a direct relationship with the \"festa\" or holiday. It is typical to buy or prepare cocas during holidays, especially during Easter (Pasqua), Christmas (Nadal) and St John's Eve (la revetlla de Sant Joan). Some cocas even have the names of saints and they are eaten on that saint's day (such as the Saint John's Coca, \"Coca de Sant Joan\"). Nonetheless, many eat them without any religious or festive reason, especially if we consider that in places like Italy, this dish doesn't carry any special significance. The \"Coca de Recapte\" obeys this logic exactly, since the \"recapte\" is a kind of picnic habitually taken out into the fields.\n\nCoca, being the Catalan variety of a Mediterranean dish, has local counterparts all over the Mediterranean, especially in its savoury kind. Apart from Italy, other countries also have similar cakes, pies and pastries. Three examples are the Pissaladière from Provence, the Lahmacun from Turkey and the \"Bouchée à la Reine\" from France and Luxembourg, where it is one of the national dishes. Similarly, sweet pies can be found all over Europe.

{"id": "16875005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16875005", "title": "Haida argillite carvings", "text": "Haida argillite carvings\n\nHaida argillite carvings are a sculptural tradition among the Haida indigenous nation of the Northwest Coast of North America. It first became a widespread art form in the early 19th century, and continues today. \nArgillite became a popular carving medium after the decline of the sea otter fur trade in the early 19th century. These carvings enabled Haida to trade with visiting Europeans. Argillite carvings, therefore, are commonly seen as a tourist art because they were firstly designed to be exported from the Haida community and created solely as a means of economic prosperity. As a result, argillite carvings contain imagery that encompass both Haida and European cultures. Sometimes the imagery is mixed with traditional Haida forms melding with European styles. Often in argillite carvings, traditional Haida images are confused so that they lose their important cultural meanings. This ensured that culturally symbolic imagery was not being used as a means of economic prosperity for the community. These forms of argillite carvings also contained a lot of visual punning and joke making both at objects and animals in general as well as European culture. The argillite that the Haida use to carve is located on Haida Gwaii, formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands. The quarry is owned by the Haida who have the sole right to use the substance from that quarry for carving. Today argillite carvings are sold in galleries and fine art stores and take on a more traditional Haida forms.\n\nHaida artists have been carving the black slate of the island of Haida Gwaii for several hundred years. From its conception, the art has depicted a variety of images, from traditional Haida forms, to Western figures. Despite this, Haida argillite carving has only been studied systematically during the last thirty to forty years. It is commonly known as a tourist art because of the circumstances surrounding its creation and the subject matter which it often contained. In truth, argillite carving is much more than a simple tourist art. The art form has grown to be highly prized by museums and private collectors. Canadian anthropologists and ethnographers have been studying argillite for approximately 60 years as have, albeit more recently, American art historians. Argillite carving continues to thrive today and it can be expected that new phases and periods will emerge as time goes on.\n\nArgillite is similar to the substance known as catlinite which was used by the indigenous peoples of the American Plains to carve their ceremonial pipes. However, while catlinite is of a reddish-brown color because of its high iron oxide content, argillite is a dark-grey to black color because of its higher carbon content.\n\nArgillite used by the Haida is found at the Slatechuck argillite quarry on Slatechuck Mountain near Skidegate on the east flank of Graham Island of Haida Gwaii. In the Skidegate dialect of the Haida language argillite is called \"kwawhlhal\". The quarry is very difficult to get to and its exact location is a heavily guarded secret by those who are able to point it out on a map. Argillite is an important commodity for the Haida people and presently only the Haida have the right to use the variety found at Slatechuck Creek, which occurs nowhere else in the world. One of the first documented reports of the Slatechuck quarry occur in about 1820 when prospectors looking for coal or copper came across a large deposit of the black slate. According to Marius Barbeau, a Canadian ethnographer who studied argillite throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the native owner of the land the quarry was located on was George Gunya, one of the first known argillite carvers.\n\nThe argillite from the Slatechuck quarry does not contain quartz or feldspar, and the organic matrix from which it is constructed is highly complex, characteristics which make it different from other argillites. The Slatechuck argillite began to form about 70 million years ago when a nearby vent in the earth's crust heated a shale layer formed of kaolin and carbonaceous matrices. To the naked eye, argillite looks similar to other forms of shale, but differs microscopically as there are high amounts of organic materials trapped throughout the matrix.\n\nAlthough carvers usually prefer to collect argillite from the quarry themselves, it is not uncommon for groups of able-bodied individuals other than the carvers to make the arduous journey. These trips generally consist of a number of individuals who bring back enough argillite for carvers to carve for at least a year. The argillite collectors select the slate that appears most free of faults. A slab of up to 500-600 pounds (approximately 227-272 kilograms) is cut from the quarry using a variety of tools, including a hand saw, steel wedge, sledge hammer, shovel, crowbar, and long pole to use for leverage. The large slab is cut into smaller pieces of between 50 and 100 pounds each, and carried slowly and carefully home by the collectors.\n\nMost carvers create a sculpture from a single piece of argillite wherever possible. However, because an increase in the size of argillite increases the potential for failure in the piece due to inherent faults and stresses, larger sculptures are sometimes made from separate pieces carved and subsequently adhered. High relief is often carved by working against the grain. This technique lends stability to the fragile argillite. The drawback to this method is that it sometimes causes flaking, making carving in high relief an advanced carving technique. For a long, shallow piece, it is often better to work with the grain. Different objects require varying levels of skill in their execution. Panel pipes are considered the most difficult pieces to carve. Bowls are also challenging, with group figurines, boxes, poles and plates considered easier to do. The black finish of argillite is usually not natural. In its natural state, argillite is often a grey-black or green-black color. The jet-black finish is created by the carver rubbing the carving with the oils or polish as it is being created. The natural oils that skin produces are actually responsible for creating the deep black color argillite is known for, although it is also common to coat the argillite with a polish to recreate the jet-black color.\n\nA high moisture content makes argillite easier to carve; therefore, it is kept as moist as possible after it is extracted from the Slatechuck quarry. It is often wrapped with damp cloth and stored somewhere moist, perhaps buried in the ground. Another method of sealing in moisture is to cover the surface of the uncarved argillite piece with Varathane. The drier the argillite becomes, the more danger there is of flaking or cracking during the carving process.\n\nKnut Fladmark, a professor in the Archaeology Department at Simon Fraser University, believes argillite was known to the Haida pre-European contact, and that it had been used for more utilitarian purposes such as the creation of labrets. Fladmark excavated at the Richardson Ranch site on Graham Island, located near the mouth of the Tlell River. During the summers of 1969 and 1970 he found the first major archaeological assemblage of argillite. Fladmark's analysis of the assemblage led him to believe that the creation of argillite pieces for the purpose of trade followed its use within the Haida community as a pipestone. The elbow pipes Fladmark discovered at the site may predate the generally accepted 1820 start date for the production of argillite as a saleable commodity. These elbow pipes have little to no decoration and seemingly serve a utilitarian purpose only, characteristics which separate them from the later non-functional panel pipes, and other solely aesthetic argillite pieces. Also, Fladmark notes the discovery of a labret in the archaeological record which appears to be made from argillite.\n\nRobin Kathleen Wright believes it was the introduction of the tobacco pipe into the Haida culture that spawned the first argillite carvings. Smoking tobacco was introduced to the Haida by European and American sailors. Argillite pipes that show evidence of smoking tobacco date from about 1810–1840 and are generally small in size but have proportionally large bowls. These very early argillite pieces depict traditional Haida images normally seen on totem poles, masks, rattles and spoon handles.\n\nHaida art has always held images of rank, lineage and status and it can be perceived as a type of \"recording device\" for a society which has a rich history but no written tradition. Commercial argillite carving seems to have begun during the 1820s when it became valued as a trade item. Haida do not during this time seem to use argillite for any utilitarian function, or any function other than carving. For the Haida, argillite was perhaps part of a movement towards greater financial gain. Increased monetary wealth became more important throughout the 19th century and the sale of argillite was one method that facilitated this. Prior to 1820 there were no argillite carvings found in any public or private collections. Part of the movement toward argillite carving was the declining sea otter populations and the subsequent wane in the trade of sea otter pelts.\n\nCanadian ethnographer Marius Barbeau was one of the first to analyze the art extensively. Barbeau believed that argillite carving had been created through the Haida's exposure to whalers' scrimshaw during contact with European and Euro-American traders. However, as later researchers have noted, the art of scrimshaw was not introduced to the Haida until approximately 20 years after the start of argillite carving. Barbeau also believed that the argillite carving only began to progress into a new phase around 1870, when more traditional themes began to replace the Western oriented styles that had dominated argillite carving until that point. In his research Barbeau overlooked the earliest argillite carvings which made use of entirely traditional images.\n\nCarole Kaufmann, an art historian from the University of California, made large contributions to the understanding of Haida argillite carving in her Ph.D. dissertation \"Changes in Argillite Carvings, 1820 to 1910\" where she analyzed the social and cultural influences on the style and type of carving being produced at the time. Kaufmann's first period was one of exploration in a new medium. Argillite carving at this time parallels carvings in other mediums, such as wood.\n\nThis first phase, named Haida I, existed from about 1820 to 1830. The second phase began in 1830 and was titled the Western Period. This is when argillite carving began to incorporate Western elements and themes. Kaufman refutes the idea that this phase is influenced by European and Euro-American buyers who wanted to purchase Haida carved argillite in Western themes. She also disagrees with the theory Barbeau and Erna Gunther proposed: that Western themed argillite carving was inspired by whalers' scrimshaw. Kaufmann interprets the move toward Western images in the 1830s as the Haida's receptivity to European culture, and the social desire to incorporate the Western mode of life more fully into their own world. Phases one and two are similar in that none of the items carved are sacred; instead all of the argillite carvings produced between 1820 and 1865, the approximate end date for the second period, are utilitarian pieces and completely secular in nature. The third period Haida II, is marked by a return to Haida inspired images, theme and styles and begins five years after the end of the second, in 1870. Although this return to more traditional images has been interpreted as stabilization in Haida society due to the decrease of whalers and traders in the region, Kaufmann believes the substitution was actually caused by the disintegration of social and artistic regulation. Because the Haida population had been decimated due to contact elements such as disease, increased mobility, and missionary influences the traditional rules which regulated the production of culturally important objects and images began to degrade. According to Kaufmann, the proliferation of sacred or respected imagery or objects in a medium such as argillite was in actuality \"a loosening within the traditional social structure\" \n\nRobin Kathleen Wright, another American art historian, built upon Kaufmann's thesis using Haida argillite pipes as a foundation. Wright contributed two elements to the study of argillite carving: she developed the idea that it was the introduction of tobacco pipes to the Northwest Coast that helped inspire the beginnings of argillite carving and successfully correlated Western influences on Haida culture and their effects on argillite style and imagery.\n\nWilson Duff, a Canadian anthropologist, noted some problems with the aforementioned theories of progression in the styles and themes of Haida argillite carving. Duff reanalyzed the history of argillite carving and the existing theories concerning its influences and interpreted a timeline founded on what he calls \"sense\" and \"non-sense\". Instead of Kaufmann's three periods, Duff broke the history of argillite carving into four phases. He used Kaufmann's first three phases and added a fourth which he subsequently divided into two parts.\n\nDuff's first period dates between the years 1800–1835. This is a \"non-sense\" period which is characterized by a lack of logical compositions of traditional Haida images or themes. According to Duff, these illogical representations in argillite are due to an unwillingness on the Haida's behalf to allow important elements of their culture to be owned by Europeans and Americans. Duff's second period is called \"White Man’s Non-sense\" and takes place between 1830 and 1865. This period is filled with argillite carvings depicting Europeans or Americans which are often carved using a more Western influenced style. This movement towards more Western styles and themes is potentially due to an increase in contact between the two cultures. There were also many mixed images and visual punning carried out during Duff's \"Non-Sense\" period. This \"non-sense\" theme is therefore also indicative of the Haida's ridicule of Western culture's seeming lack of rationality.\nThe depictions of Western culture increased and grew more detailed and elaborate during this period. By 1865 there are conventions in Haida depictions of Western style clothing, and a merging of traditional and Western methods of figure representation. The third period existed between 1865 and 1910. This \"Haida sense\" period represents a movement back to strongly traditional themes in argillite carving, most likely due to the population and culture decrease happening throughout Haida society at the time. Meaning is suddenly apparent in argillite carving, as are important Haida figures such as chiefs and shamans and sacred or religious themes. Haida myths begin to be represented in the carvings, the Bear-Mother myth being one of the most common myth themes that appear in this period. Duff sees this period as being an attempt by the Haida to record elements of their culture that were quickly being forgotten because of religious conversion or because of death. By 1910 the art of argillite carving was beginning to decline in conjunction with the continued loss of Haida individuals and culture. Duff's fourth period is composed of two phases and added to Kaufmann's original chronology. This period is entitled \"Haida-Sense II\" and existed between the years 1910–1981, making it the longest period in Duff's model. Many of the great Haida artists producing carvings in the third period died during the early years of the fourth period causing a lack of skilled carvers and a stall in the production of argillite carvings. This first phase of period four is what Duff calls \"The Plateau Era\". The plateau era is ended by a nationwide revitalization in the 1960s which occurred throughout Native American communities in order to revitalize the practice of traditional cultures. Aspiring argillite carvers looked to remaining older carvers, academia, museums and galleries for information on how to carve.\n\n\n\n"}

One version states that cooks aboard Neapolitan ships returning from the Americas invented marinara sauce in the mid-16th century after Spaniards introduced the tomato (a central Mexican \"New World\" fruit) to Europe.

It is usually composed of two or more flavors of ice cream, often with either fruit syrup or frozen fruit — typically raspberry, strawberry, or cherry — in the center. It is typically covered in a shell made of chocolate or cocoa, but cinnamon or nuts are also used.\n\n\"Tartufo di Pizzo\" has Protected Geographical Indication in Italy. \n\nIn 1946 master confectioner Dante Veronelli from Messina took over the Gran Bar Excelsior situated in the centre of Pizzo, that was first owned by Mr. Jannarelli. The name was soon changed into Bar Dante in Honour of Veronelli.\n\nIn order to improve and give a future to his business, Veronelli was helped by young Giuseppe De Maria (known as Don Pippo), he, too, from Messina and whose contribution was absolutely important. Merging the entrepreneurial skills of the former and the productivity of the latter, the two were able to gain the attention of people thanks to the great quality and undisputed taste of their products.\n\nAfter Veronelli's death, De Maria remained the only owner of the business.\n\nThe \"tartufo\" in its present shape was born in Pizzo in the laboratory of Bar Dante (around 1952) just by chance: following the marriage of two wealthy locals, Don Pippo discovered that he had run out of molds used to shape the ice cream and couldn't supply the numerous guests. So he tried to solve the problem putting a small portion of Heizel ice cream and one of chocolate ice-cream in the hollow of his hand, after which he added a bit of melted chocolate. He then wrapped everything in sugar paper, thereby creating the well-known shape of the \"tartufo\" which he then left to cool. The success of the preparation earned him immediate fame. The original recipe is still treasured by De Maria's relatives.\n\nIn 1950, Giorgio Di Iorgi and Gaetano Di Iorgi, who had started their career working in the ice cream parlor with the role of waiters, began to learn the art of making ice cream; 15 years later, following the retirement of maestro De Maria, Giorgio took over the activity of the Gelateria Dante, while Gaetano continued the production of the Tartufo di Pizzo in the opposite activity (\"Bar Ercole\") which he acquired together with his brother Antonio in 1965.\n\nFrom this moment on, the Bar Dante and Bar Ercole activities are managed by a family management, passing from father to son the secret recipe for making ice-cream products.\n\n\"Tartufo\" is usually composed of two flavors of ice cream which are sculpted together by hand. If there is fruit in the middle, the ice cream may be scooped out from the middle and the fruit placed inside, or fruit syrup may be used to paste the two scoops together. If its shell is chocolate, special chocolate is usually melted and either dipped or poured over the ice cream ball after being cooled to lukewarm — though it can also be rolled in the chocolate — and then frozen. If its shell is cinnamon or cocoa, it is usually rolled in cinnamon or cocoa before freezing. If it uses nuts, they are usually put on by hand if large or rolled on if smaller. For a better shape, circular molds are sometimes used.\n"}

It was invented by physician William Oliver of Bath, Somerset around 1750, giving the biscuit its name.\n\nWhen Oliver died, he bequeathed to his coachman, Mr. Atkins, the recipe for the Bath Oliver biscuit, together with £100 and ten sacks of the finest wheat-flour. Atkins promptly set up his biscuit-baking business and became rich. Later the business passed to a man named Norris, who sold out to a baker called Carter, although it is possible that several Bath bakers were producing the biscuit in competition. During the nineteenth century the Bath Oliver biscuit recipe passed to James Fortt.\nThe company continued to produce the biscuit well into the second half of the twentieth century. Bath Olivers are currently produced by United Biscuits.\n\nThe reference to Bath Oliver biscuits by Mary Norton in 'The Borrowers' 1952 evokes an Edwardian gentility: \". . . and it would comfort him to see, each evening at dusk, Mrs. Driver appear at the head of the stairs and cross the passage carrying a tray for Aunt Sophy with Bath Oliver biscuits and the tall, cut-glass decanter of Fine Old Pale Madeira.\"\n\nSimilarly, Bath Oliver biscuits seem to evoke a nostalgic, very English, idyll in the first chapter of \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" by Rudyard Kipling: \"[the child heroes of the story] were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper—hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope—with them. [...] Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass.\"\nAlso the biscuits are a favourite of Inspector Lestrade in the M. J. Trow mystery series.\nIn \"The Pound Era\" by Hugh Kenner, Ezra Pound associates the cracker with a receding world of manners when he remembers \"Men of my time have witnessed 'parties' in London gardens where, as I recall it, everyone else (male) wore grey 'toppers' . . . Men have witnessed the dinner ceremony on flagships, where the steward still called it 'claret' and a Bath Oliver appeared with the cheese. (Stilton? I suppose it must have been Stilton.)\"\n\nIn \"Hamlet, Revenge!\" (1937), part III, chapter one, mystery writer Michael Innes places Bath Olivers among the standard amenities of a country house bedroom in the 1930s. As the house steward explains to Inspector Appleby, \"Two Bath Olivers, two Richtea, and two digestive in every room. Replenished daily and changed three times a week. The Bath Olivers go to Mr. Bagot [the butler]—he has a Partiality for Them—and the others to the servants' hall.\"\nIn 'Rebecca' the narrator \"steals\" six Bath Olivers from the dining room sideboard before exploring Manderley by herself for the first time.\n\nDuring World War II, the Crown Jewels were hidden in a secret chamber deep beneath Windsor Castle. The royal archivist pried out all of the major stones from the regalia and placed them inside a Bath Oliver tin so that most important part of the Crown jewels could be quickly removed and hidden, should the Germans invade.\n"}

In 1958, Graham's Continental was launched (based upon a local brew called Graham's Golden) and quickly changed to Graham's Skol to give a Scandinavian impression (the plant had actually been imported from Sweden). The name was later revised to just Skol.\n\nAllied Breweries (UK), Labatt (Canada), Pripps-Bryggerierna (Sweden), and Unibra (Belgium) formed a new company called Skol International in 1964. Its aim was the creation of a worldwide beer brand, Skol, which could be licensed, manufactured and marketed across the world. In the late 1960s, it was heavily advertised on Dutch pirate Radio Veronica as Skol International, with an advertising jingle sung by Patrica Paay, later a very successful Dutch pop singer and TV presenter. Since then participation in the company has changed significantly.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1982, beer under the Skol brand was brewed by the Dutch Oranjeboom Brewery, but it was not a success in the Dutch market.\n\nIn 1992, the merger between Allied Breweries and Carlsberg created Carlsberg-Tetley's, who moved the production of Skol from Alloa to their brewery in Leeds until this brewery was closed in 2011. It continues to be distributed in the UK, with an ABV reduced to 2.8%.\n\nCurrently, Skol is one of the most popular beer brands in Brazil, still trailing Brahma beer. It was originally produced by Caracu, which was bought by Brahma in 1980. In 1999, Brahma merged with Antarctica and became AmBev, then InBev, and later AB InBev. Skol beer became internationally recognized as a Brazilian beer, though not initially conceived in Brazil.\n\nCarlsberg holds the license to brew and market the beer worldwide, except for Africa and South America. Unibra holds the license for Africa. In Europe, the beer is also marketed in Turkey, and in Romania. In Asia, it is distributed in Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In Africa, it is present in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Madagascar, and Rwanda.\n\nThe name is the English language variant of the Scandinavian drink toast \"skål\". For a time, the Hägar the Horrible cartoon character was used for promotion.\n\nIn the Brazilian market Skol has added a new drink to their brand named \"Skol Beats\" which has a citrus taste and 3 flavors: blue, red and green, all containing approximately 7.9% of alcohol.\n\nThe brand was awarded a Gold Award at the 2012 World Quality Selections, organized by Monde Selection.

It is a simple meal, popular in the United Kingdom. When prepared correctly, the cheese covers the bread exactly so there are no bitter burnt edges.\n\nCheese on toast, or \"cheesy toast\" consists of toast, either buttered or not, with cheese on one side. Further toppings are optional; the most basic being chopped onions (raw or grilled with the cheese), brown sauce or ketchup. Pickled cucumber, Branston pickle, fried tomatoes, fried eggs, Worcestershire sauce and baked beans are also common. Another common variation is to add something to the toast before applying the cheese, such as tomato, or a thin layer of spread Marmite, Vegemite (in Australia), cream spread, mustard or tomato ketchup.\n\nRecipe books and internet articles tend to elaborate on the basics, adding ingredients and specifying accompaniments to make more interesting reading. Consequently, published recipes seldom deal with the most basic form of the dish and frequently refer to the similar dish of Welsh rarebit as \"posh cheese on toast\".\n\nCheddar cheese is most commonly used for Toasted Cheese, as this is a particularly good cheese for toasting. Lancashire dairies, in conjunction with a \"National Toasted Cheese Day\", have promoted Lancashire cheese as the best cheese to use. In Scotland the dish is sometimes referred to as roasted cheese or 'melted cheese', where the bread need not be toasted before applying the cheese.\n"}

After 2010 it has penetrated to many places popular for tourists in the Czech Republic or Slovakia. The word \"trdelník\" is of Czech-Slovak origin; the root of this word, \"trdlo,\" is the name of the wooden tool the cake ingredients are wrapped around during cooking (which gives it its traditional hollow shape), and can also mean \"simpleton\" in English (see \"trdlo\").\n\nNowadays, \"trdelník\" is very popular among tourists as a sweet pastry in many countries, mostly in the Czech Republic. Alternative versions, with fillings such as ice cream, has been spreading in popularity from its origin in Prague after 2010.\n\nThe version from the Slovak town of Skalica (\"Skalický trdelník\") was registered in December 2007 as a PGI (protected geographical indication) in the European Union. The registration application with the detailed description of the product was published in April 2007 in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nAlthough trdelník is usually presented as \"a traditional Czech cake\" or \"the old Bohemian pastry\", the mass spread of this dessert in Prague is recognized to have started at some point around 2010. The local populations in the Czech Republic usually have never heard of trdelník, so the mass spread of trdelník can be considered a symptom of mass tourism — a marketing trick, scam or a tourist trap. Sellers often make tourists think that they are eating something traditional. Czech cinematographer and reporter Janek Rubeš says that trdelník is only made for tourists, arguing that even the hamburger is more traditional in the Czech Republic. He also says in the video for tourists on his YouTube channel Honest Guide: \"Ask any Czech grandmother, how often she was making this... NEVER [...] Just keep in mind, that has nothing to do with us. Ok? It came with you.\"\n\nThe production of trdelník has a long tradition in the Slovak town of Skalica near the border with the Czech Republic. The original recipe was owned by the cook of József Gvadányi a retired Hungarian general what is resident of Skalica at the end of the 18th century. The original recipe was improved by the inhabitants of Skalica to its final form now known as \"Skalický trdelník\".\n\nThe civil association \"Skalický trdelník\" was founded at the end of 2004 with the goal of keeping the tradition of the original open fire Trdelník production.\n\n\n\n"}

A substantial dish prepared with meat and vegetables, it is most popular during the winter but is served throughout the year in some restaurants.\n\nThe origins of the dish are uncertain, but most sources agree that probably it was created during the Middle Ages as an evolution of the Sephardic dish adafina. Long-cooking dishes were indispensable for Jews as they allowed hearty meals during Shabbat. These first versions were kosher, using eggs and without pork. Within time, adafina was soon popular elsewhere.\n\nThe growth of anti-Semitism and the Inquisition during the 15th and 16th centuries modified the dish substantially, as the fear of being denounced as Jewish forced Christians and \"Marranos\" (converted Jews) alike to prove themselves as Christians by incorporating pork into their meals. Soon lard, bacon, \"chorizo\" (pork sausage) and \"morcilla\" (blood sausage) were added to the dish.\n\nFrom these origins, the recipe allowed few modifications and was soon established as a staple of Madrid cuisine. During the growth of the city in the 19th and 20th centuries, its low cost and heartiness made it a popular order in small restaurants and the taverns catering to manual workers. After the Civil War, the austerity period, followed by the introduction of more convenient meals, reduced the public popularity of the dish.\n\nThe main ingredient of \"cocido\" is the chickpea or \"garbanzo\". Vegetables are added: potatoes mainly, but also cabbage, carrots, and turnips. In some cases, green bean, mangold, cardoon or cheese are also added.\n\nThe meat used is fundamentally pork: pork belly, usually fresh, but sometimes cured (some purists even insist to a point of rancidity); fresh (unsmoked) \"chorizo\"; onion \"morcilla\", and dried and cured jamón serrano. Beef shank is also added; the fat content (\"flor\") of the piece is highly prized. Chicken (especially old hens) is also part of the \"cocido\".\n\nTwo bone pieces (ham bone and beef spine bone) are added to enrich the stock.\n\nFor some recipes, the final touch is the \"bola\", a meatball-like mix of ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley and other spices, which, it is said, was created as a substitute of the eggs used in the \"adafaina\".\n\nTradition rules that the ingredients of \"cocido\" must be served separately. Each serving is known as a \"vuelco\" (tipping or emptying out), as at each time the pot must be emptied out to separate the ingredients.\n\nThe first \"vuelco\" is to separate the stock of the \"cocido\" and serve it with noodles added. The second \"vuelco\" consists of the chickpeas and the vegetables. The third \"vuelco\" is the meat dish.\n\nTraditionally, dishes made with the leftovers of the \"cocido\" include Spanish \"croquetas\" (croquettes), \"ropa vieja\" and \"pringá\".\n\n"}

It is marketed with the slogan \"Carabao Dang: The Fighting Spirit\".\n\nThe drink's launch was accompanied by a high profile TV advertising campaign featuring the company founder, rock star Yuenyong Opakul, also known as Aed Carabao. This campaign was investigated by the Office of the Consumer Protection Board for being too violent. but went on to win a gold and a silver medal at \"Media & Marketing\" magazine's Asian Brand Marketing Effectiveness Awards in 2003.

It is owned and distributed by the Dutch brewer Heineken International.\n\nMurphy's was heavily promoted worldwide by Heineken throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, but it ultimately failed to substantially dent Guinness' global stout market share, and Heineken have since directed their attentions to other brands.\n\nIt is brewed to be less heavy and less bitter than its chief competitor Guinness. Its flavour is evocative of caramel and malt, and is described as \"a distant relative of chocolate milk\". The resemblance to milk extends beyond flavour to texture: Murphy's is free from any hint of carbonation, and is delivered \"black as strong cappuccino\" with an inch of foam – the head – on top. The water of the River Lee in Cork allegedly gave Murphy's its quality.\n\nLocal Irish history pits the Guinness drinkers of Dublin squarely against the Murphy's drinkers of Cork. There has long been a lively rivalry between the two, with Murphy's viewed as the more \"craft\" stout, and Guinness being the more mainstream. After years as a solely local stout, the acquisition of the brewery by Heineken in 1983, with a consequent expansion in distribution and international television advertising, exposed Murphy's to the international drinking community. In 1988, Whitbread acquired the distribution and brewing rights for Murphy's in the UK, where it was brewed in the Magor brewery at Magor in Wales. In 2000, these rights went to Interbrew when they acquired Whitbread Brewing Company.\n\nIn addition to being distributed in kegs, Murphy's is also available in a can. To simulate the appearance and texture of the tap version, cans of Murphy's contain a nitrogen widget, which increases the creaminess of the head when poured.\n\nExport volumes peaked in the mid-1990s and domestic volume peaked around 2000. The brand is suffering in its native Ireland due to a declining market for stout. It holds a 5 per cent market share of the Irish on trade stout market, although this is largely a result of its 28 per cent share of its native Cork market. Murphy's has a limited presence in Ireland outside of Cork. In 2011, 60,000 hectolitres of Murphy's were sold in Ireland.\n\nMurphy's was launched on draught in the United Kingdom in 1989. Cans were launched in 1992. It is now rarely found on draught in the UK, although is stocked by many major supermarkets in cans. In the UK it is brewed at Heineken's Tadcaster plant in North Yorkshire for the home market and some export markets. According to Euromonitor, Murphy's sold 25,000 hl in the UK in 2011. Murphy's held less than five percent of the British stout market in 2016.\n\nPopular export markets include Norway and Italy. In New York the importer is United States Beverage (USB), which is a premium imported /craft beer sales and marketing company located in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1997 an anime television advertisement was created for Murphy's called \"Last Orders\". It was created by Production I.G (the creators of \"Ghost in the Shell\"), and directed by Hiroyuki Kitakubo. The 60-second film features six fierce samurai who rush through a post-futuristic megalopolis to make it on time for the last order at their favourite pub. It was the first anime style commercial film ever aired in the UK and Ireland.\n\nMurphy's Irish Stout is the main sponsor of the Cork Athletic Union League, an association football league featuring amateur and junior clubs from County Cork. They were also the title sponsor of the Irish Open golf tournament from 1994 to 2002.\n"}

There are many ways to prepare and cook squid, with every country and region having its own recipes. Fried squid appears in Mediterranean cuisine. In Lebanon, Syria and Armenia, it is served with a tarator sauce. In New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, it is sold in fish and chip shops. In North America, fried squid is a staple in seafood restaurants. In Britain, it can be found in Mediterranean 'calamari' or Asian 'salt and pepper fried squid' forms in all kinds of establishments, often served as a bar snack, street food or starter.\n\nSquid can be prepared for consumption in other ways. In Korea, it is sometimes served raw, and elsewhere it is used as sushi, sashimi and tempura items, grilled, stuffed, covered in batter, stewed in gravy and served in stir-fries, rice, and noodle dishes. Dried shredded squid is a common snack in some Asian countries, including East Asia.\n\nThe body (mantle) can be stuffed whole, cut into flat pieces or sliced into rings. The arms, tentacles, and ink are edible; the only parts of the squid that are not eaten are its beak and gladius (pen).\n\nIn Chinese and Southeast Asian cuisine, squid is used in stir-fries, rice, and noodle dishes. It may be heavily spiced.\n\nIn China, Thailand, and Japan squid is grilled whole and sold in food stalls\n\nPre-packaged dried shredded squid or cuttlefish are snack items in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China and Russia, often shredded to reduce chewiness.\n\nIn Japan, squid is used in almost every type of dish, including sushi, sashimi, tempura, stewed (\"nabemono\"), and grilled (\"ikayaki\").\n\nIn Korea, squid is sometimes killed and served quickly. Unlike octopus, squid tentacles do not usually continue to move when reaching the table. This fresh squid is 산 오징어 (\"san ojingeo\") (also with small octopi called \"nakji\"). The squid is served with Korean mustard, soy sauce, chili sauce, or sesame sauce. It is salted and wrapped in lettuce or pillard leaves. Squid is also marinated in hot pepper sauce and cooked on a pan (Nakji Bokum or Ojingeo Bokum). They are also served by food stands as a snack food, battered and deep fried or grilled using hot skillets. They are also cut up into small pieces to be added to 해물파전 (Korean Seafood Pancake) or a variety of spicy seafood soups. Dried squid may also accompany alcoholic beverages such as \"anju\". Dried squid is served with peanuts. Squid is roasted and served with hot pepper paste or mayonnaise as a dip. Steamed squid and boiled squid are delicacies.\n\nAlso in Korea, squid is made into \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood). The \"ojingeo-jeot\", thin strips of skinned, gutted, washed, salted, and fermented squid seasoned with spicy \"gochutgaru\" (chili powder)-based spices and minced aromatic vegetables, is a popular \"banchan\" (side dish) served in small quantities as an accompaniment to bap (cooked rice). In Japan, similar dish is called \"ika-no-shiokara\". The heavily salted squid (usually sparkling enope (firefly) squid or spear squid), sometimes with innards, ferments for as long as a month, and is preserved in small jars. This salty, strong flavoured item is served in small quantities as an accompaniment to white rice or alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn the Philippines, squid is cooked as \"adobong pusit\", squid in adobo sauce, along with the ink, imparting a tangy flavour, especially with fresh chillies. Battered squid rings, which is also sold as a popular deep-fried street food called \"calamares\" in the Philippines, is served with alioli, mayonnaise or chilli vinegar. Squid is grilled on charcoal, brushed with a soy sauce-based marinade, and stuffed with tomato and onions. Another recipe is \"rellenong pusit\", stuffed with finely-chopped vegetables, squid fat, and ground pork. A variant of \"pancit\" noodles is \"pancit pusit\", which is \"pancit bihon\" with squid added, along with the ink, giving the noodles its dark color.\n\nIn India and Sri Lanka, squid or cuttlefish is eaten in coastal areas for example, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Squid are eaten deep fried (Koonthal Fry) or as squid gravy (koonthal varattiyathu/Roast). In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, squid are called \"koonthal\", \"kanava\" or \"kadamba\".\n\nIn Egypt, Cyprus and Turkey, squid rings and arms are coated in batter and fried in oil. Other recipes from these regions feature squid (or octopus) simmered slowly, with added vegetables. In Greek or Turkish cuisine, there is also a stuffed squid dish (\"gemisto kalamari\", \"kalamar dolma\").\n\nIn Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, fried squid is served with tarator, a sauce made using tahini. Like many seafood dishes, it may be served with a slice of lemon.\n\nFried squid (calamari) is a dish in Mediterranean cuisine. It consists of batter-coated squid, deep-fried for less than two minutes to prevent toughness. It is served plain, with salt and lemon on the side.\n\nIn Spain, (\"rabas\" or \"calamares a la romana\", battered calamari, lit. \"Roman-style calamari\") has the calamari rings covered in a thick batter, deep fried, and with lemon juice and mayonnaise or garlic mayonnaise. Battered and fried baby squid is \"puntillitas\". Squid stewed in its own black ink is called \"calamares en su tinta\" or \"chipirones en su tinta\" resulting a black stew-like dish in which squid meat is very tender and is accompanied by a thick black sauce usually made with onion, tomato, squid ink, among others.\n\nIn Spain and Italy, squid or cuttlefish ink is eaten in dishes such as paella, risotto, soups and pasta.\n\nIn Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Croatia, squid rings and arms are coated in batter and fried in oil. Other recipes from these regions feature squid (or octopus) simmered slowly, with vegetables such as squash or tomato. When frying, the squid flesh is kept tender by short cooking time. When simmering, the flesh is most tender when cooking is prolonged with reduced temperature.\n\nIn Portugal, \"lulas\" are commonly eaten grilled whole, in kebabs of squid rings with bell peppers and onion (\"Espetadas\") or stewed. Also stuffed with minced meat and stewed (\"Lulas Recheadas\"). The battered version is known as 'lulas à sevilhana', named after Seville, the Andalusian city that popularised the dish.\n\nIn Malta, \"klamar mimli\" involves stuffing the squid with rice, breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic and capers and then gently stewing in red wine.\n\nIn Sardinia, squid are served with a sauce made from lemon, garlic, parsley, and olive oil (yes, we know that Sardinia is part of Italy).\n\nIn Slovenia, squid are eaten grilled and stuffed with pršut and cheese, with \"blitva\" (Swiss chard).\n\nIn Russia, a lightly boiled julienned squid with onion rings, garnished with mayonnaise, makes a salad. Another dish is a squid stuffed with rice and vegetables and then roasted.\n\nIn South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, fried calamari is popular in fish and chip shops; imitation calamari of white fish may also be used. When offered for sale as whole fresh animals, the term calamari should only be used to describe the northern and southern calamari (\"Sepioteuthis spp\".), however once prepared as food it is common to apply the term calamari to any squid species and even cuttlefish. \n\nIn North America, fried squid is a staple in seafood restaurants. It is served as an appetizer, garnished with parsley, or sprinkled with parmesan cheese. It is served with dips: peppercorn mayonnaise, tzatziki, or in the United States, marinara sauce, tartar sauce, or cocktail sauce. In Mexico it is served with Tabasco sauce or habanero. Other dips, such as ketchup, aioli, and olive oil are used. In the United States, the government and industry worked together to popularize calamari consumption in the 1990s.\n\nIn the United States, in an attempt to popularize squid as a protein source in the 1970s, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a squid-gutting machine, and submitted squid cocktail, rings, and chowder to a 70-person tasting panel for market research. Despite a general lack of popularity of squid in the United States, aside from the internal \"ethnic market\", polling had shown a negative public perception of squid foods, the tasting panel gave the dishes \"high marks\".\n\nThe direct source of the English name \"calamari\" is disputed, with Spanish \"calamar\", Italian \"calamaro\", and Modern Greek \"kalamári\" being cited. Ultimately, all of these terms derive from the Late Latin \"calamarium\", \"pen case\" or \"ink pot\", itself from the Latin \"calamarius\", \"pertaining to a writing-reed\", after the resemblance in shape and the inky fluid that squid secrete; \"calamarius\" in turn derives from the Greek \"kalamos\" 'reed' or 'pen'.\n\nAllergies to calamari can occur.

Its main ingredients are flour, water, olive oil, garlic, paprika and salt.\n\nGachas are based on a very ancient Iberian flour-based staple food preparation.\nGachas may have different consistencies, from a liquid soup to a pie-like thick cake with a golden crust. The way of preparing them changes from area to area and from family to family.\n\nGachas is considered an unrefined rural dish, the food of shepherds, farmers and itinerant labourers. It has been also described as a 'fundamental Gitano dish'.\nThe \"gachas\" have largely been ousted by rice and potato dishes in most areas of Spain during the 20th century, especially in the towns and cities. Consumption of this simple dish resurfaced again during economic downturns and upheavals, like the Spanish Civil War, earning it the name \"gachas de los años difíciles\" (gachas of the hard years). Certain modern chefs argue though, that well-prepared gachas are not necessarily a coarse dish.\n\nAs an Iberian dish, gachas are often served with pork products, like salted or fresh bacon, liver, lug, chorizo, salchichón, morcilla, among others.\n\nAndalusian gachas, \"gachas andaluzas\", are traditionally made of wheat flour. The traditional way of cooking them consists in frying garlic slices in olive oil until they are golden. Then the flour is added by sprinkling it over the hot oil with one hand and mixing well with the spoon until the mixture is slightly roasted. Water is added then, pouring it very slowly, while stirring the mixture all the while without interrupting the bubbling. Salt and water are added to taste and desired consistency, the gachas being ready when they \"smell cooked\".\n\nThere are many variations of the gachas in Andalusia itself, as the sweet \"poleá\", the \"gachas colorás\" flavoured with paprika or saffron, or the \"gachas de matanza\" (butchery \"gachas\"), served with a stew with curdled blood, liver and offal. Fried onion and bread croutons may be also added in certain regions. Indeed, there are as many local variants as regions.\n\nThe \"gachas manchegas\" or \"gachas de almorta\" are cooked with flour made from grass peas (\"Lathyrus sativus\"). Accompaniments for the dish vary throughout La Mancha. It was generally consumed during the cold winter months. The dish is generally eaten directly out of the pan it was cooked in, using either a spoon or a simple slice of bread.\n\nThis dish is commonly consumed immediately after removing it from the fire, being careful not to burn one's lips or tongue.\n\nGrass pea flour is exceedingly difficult to obtain outside of Castilla-La Mancha, especially in its pure form. Commercial forms are mixed with wheat flour because grass peas are toxic if consumed in significantly large quantities.\n\nThe \"gachas serranas\" of Cuenca are a local variant, usually served with mushrooms and potatoes (Called zarangullo). In the comarca of la Serranía, stewed and pickled pork liver and lug is added to the gachas when the water is added, or is eaten intecalating with the own gachas. Other possible accompaniments include hot chilis or baby cucumbers in vinegar.\n\nThe \"gachas murcianas\" of the Murcia region are a variation of the \"gachas manchegas\" spiked with caraway \"(Carum carvi)\", black pepper and cloves.\n\nA type of gachas made with corn flour are popular in the area of Ademuz, in the comarca of Rincón de Ademuz, a Valencian enclave in the eastern fringes of the ancient New Castile. These gachas are generally mixed with pork or cod, as well as tomatoes and snails. The dish is part of the traditional cuisine of the area, in addition to the grass pea gachas of neighboring La Mancha that are eaten in Ademuz as well. In the Valencian Ports mountain region further northeast, a similar dish is known locally as \"Farro\".\n\nIn Aragon the same dish may be also called \"Gachas\", but more often it is referred to by the local name of \"Farinetas\". It is prepared by frying thick pieces of bacon in olive oil and taking them off the pan when they have released some fat. Then water and fine corn flour are added to the same pan, slowly stirring the mixture until it is cooked. The proportion is roughly 250 g of flour, 150 g of bacon, 1 liter of water, three large spoonfuls of extra virgin olive oil and a teaspoonful of salt.\n\nIt is common in Andalusia to prepare \"Gachas dulces\" (sweet gachas), a sweet version of the dish which can be served as a dessert. The ingredients are olive oil, flour and water, like in the traditional gachas, but adding sugar instead of garlic and salt. They may be cooked with milk instead of water. Sweet gachas may be seasoned with honey, vanilla, orange peel and cinnamon. The dish may be eaten with raisins, almonds or bread croutons.\n\nThe \"gachas extremeñas\" (also known as \"puchas dulces\") are a dessert from Extremadura flavored with anise \"(Pimpinella anisum)\". In this dish breadcrumbs are added to the mixture during the cooking.\n\n\n"}

The CSS is a mix of sidestroke, front crawl, and breaststroke. The combat side stroke allows the swimmer to swim more efficiently and reduce the body's profile in the water in order to be less likely to be seen during combat operations if surface swimming is required. The concept of CSS has been that it can be used with or without wearing swim fins (flippers), the only difference being that when wearing swim fins the swimmer's legs will always be kicking in the regular flutter kick motion without the scissor kick. This stroke is one of the strokes that can be used for prospective SEAL candidates in the SEAL physical screening test (PST), which includes a 500-yard swim in 12 minutes 30 seconds to determine if the candidate is suitable to go to the Basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL school.\n\nThe combat side stroke utilizes the three main fundamentals of swimming:\n\n\nThere are two forms to the combat side stroke: the full combat side stroke and the combat sprinter side stroke. The sprinter side stroke allows the swimmer to move faster in the water compared to the full side stroke.\n\nThe swimmer starts with the body flat and arms in a fully extended position in the water, facing downward, legs flutter kicking. One arm then pulls down in the water to the side of the body, at the same time the body rotates and the head takes a breath to the side. The second arm then pulls down with the arm to the side of the body, and the head moves back facing the bottom of the pool, enabling the body to stay horizontal in the water.

It may alternatively be referred to as the \"Sicilian vocalic scheme\" or the \"Calabro-Sicilian vowel system\".\n\nThe Sicilian vowel system differs greatly from the evolution of the Classical Latin vowel system into the Vulgar Latin vowel system found in the greater part of the Romance area. In this system, there was a lowering (laxing) of short , , , and into a seven-vowel system, while in the development of the Sicilian vowel system from that of Classical Latin, long was raised to and fused with both quantities of ; short was lowered to with an analogous development with the round vowels; i.e. long was raised to and fused with both quantities of ; short was lowered to . This resulted in a five-vowel system.\n\nThe exact historical development of the Sicilian vowel system is unknown. In southern dialects with the Sicilian vowel system, the general raising of and to and means that it is impossible to tell whether metaphony originally affected the high mid vowels. Gerhard Rohlfs holds the view that this system is not the result of internal change, but of a later romanization (\"neoromanizzazione\") of Sicily after the breakdown of Byzantine domination. Fanciullo (1984), however, claims that there was an uninterrupted continuation of Romance dialects during Byzantine domination. He explains the Sicilian vowel system through bilingualism, where Romance , was identified with Byzantine , ; variation between the two vowel systems seems to have persisted until the post-Norman era.\n\nThe ambivalent nature of Sicilian vowel development has resulted in various attempts to determine whether the vowels developed as in Italo-Western languages or as in Sardinian, with the subsequent merger to and . Calvano argued that Sicilian is an Italo-Western language, given the observation that Sicilian vocalism, but not Sardinian vocalism, is predictable from that of Italo-Western. Lausberg posited that a variation of the Italo-Western development by merging lax, high vowels with tense, mid vowels to lax, high vowels, followed by the merger which is peculiar to Sicilian. Bertoni, whose work was taken up again in Schiaffini (1957), argued that Sicilian had an intermediate Sardinian development on the basis of thirteenth century texts. Hall grouped Sicilian along with Sardinian: \"The earliest group [Southern Romance] to split off [from Proto-Romance] through not sharing in the merger of \"ĭ\" and \"ē\", involved Sardinian, Lucanian and Sicilian... Proto-Italo-Western was then defined as the \"intermediate stage that was the parent of the Romance languages not included in the Southern or Eastern groups.\" \n\nAn obvious quality of the Sicilian vowel system is the restriction of vowels other than the aforementioned five (\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"). This results in the unstressed vowel and of Latin becoming an unstressed and in Sicilian, respectively. This causes these vowels to have a far greater presence than the vowel and in Sicilian, while the opposite is true of other Romance languages such as Spanish and Italian (notwithstanding the conservative nature of Sicilian which retains the vowel of the Latin stems \"-us\" and \"-um\"). In addition, one will never find a Sicilian word ending in the unaccented vowels or , with the exception of monosyllabic conjunctions and certain recent loanwords: in fact, Due to the influence of Italian in the media after World War II, as well as the recent influx of English terminology related to technology and globalization, there is an increasing number of words entering the Sicilian lexicon that do not adhere to the Sicilian vowel system. However, Sicilian is a vigorous language and historically, has always Sicilianized foreign loanwords over time.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17234925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17234925", "title": "Truce term", "text": "Truce term\n\nA truce term is a word or short phrase accepted within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are \"barley\", \"fainites\", \"crosses\", \"kings\" and \"exe(s)\"in the United Kingdom, \"pegs\" and \"nibs\" in New Zealand and variants of \"barley\" in Australia. In the United States, terms based on \"time-out\" have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on \"kings\" and \"exe(s)\". Since the late 1980s \"time-out\" has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on the rules of the game.\n\nTraditionally these terms are specific to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as \"pax\" in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together.\n\nThe most extensive study of the use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\", which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for which there was no adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.\n\nThe use of a truce term is usually accompanied by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing \"time-out\") has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.\n\nTruce terms are recorded as having been used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.\n\nThe vocabulary of children's games, including truce terms, is described by sociolinguist Peter Trudgill in \"Dialects of England\" as being particularly rich in regional variation insofar as they are not based on official or television culture. They are an example of the subculture of young children which is transmitted by word of mouth.\n\nThe Opies conducted a study of the use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\". They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of \"pax\". In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were \"barley\", \"fainites\", \"kings\", \"crosses\", \"keys\", \"skinch\", \"cree\" and \"scribs\".\n\n\"Barley\" was recorded by the Opies as the prevailing term in east Scotland and the Borders, the Lake District, north-west England, west Midlands and in Wales, apart from the south east of Wales where \"cree\" prevailed. There were many variations such as \"barley-bay\", \"barley-bees\", \"barlow\" or \"barrels\". The use of \"barlay\" as a truce term appears in the 14th century poem \"Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight\" and Tobias Smollett's \"The Reprisal\". It is recorded in lexicographer John Jamieson's 1808 \"Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language\" as a term specifically used by children to demand truce. A probable variation also appears in the 1568 manuscript \"Chrysts-Kirk of the Grene\", sometimes attributed to James I of Scotland, as follows;\n\nThe \"Thoume\" (thumb) that is \"sklyss\" (sliced) in the quote above may refer to the thumb having been raised by the man calling \"barlafummill\", a common accompanying gesture to the use of a truce term in Scotland.\n\n\"Fainites\" and \"fains\" (or \"vainites\" and \"vains\") predominated in London and throughout southern England, apart from the \"scribs\" and \"screams\" of east Hampshire, and extended north as far as Olney in Buckinghamshire. Variations included \"fennits\", \"fannies\", \"fainsies\", \"faylines\", \"vainlights\" and \"vainyards\". \"Notes and Queries\" reported in 1870 that \"fains\" was in common use by London schoolboys. \"Faints\" appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and \"fainits\" in 1891. According to philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, the term derives from the medieval term \"fein I\", descended in turn from the Old French \"se feindre\" meaning \"to make excuses, hang back or back out of battle\". He also proposes that this use of the term throws light on line 529 of the Clerk's Tale by Chaucer that \"lordes heestes mowe nat been \"yfeyned\"\" (the lords orders cannot be treated with a \"fain I\"; in other words, declined). Another translation of the Anglo-Norman word \"feindre\" is \"pretend, feign, turn a blind eye to\", which is what the more powerful child does whilst granting respite.\n\nSpoken English south of the Danelaw became, from at least the 11th century onwards, characterised by a pronunciation known as Southern Voicing, such as \"vrog\" for frog, or \"zummer\" for summer. \"Vainites\" or \"vains\", variants of \"fainites\" or \"fains\", are surviving examples of this on the borders of the Danelaw to the north of London. Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw.\n\n\"Kings\" was recorded by the Opies as common in eastern England. \"The English Dialect Dictionary\" recorded much the same in the nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 \"Dialect of Northamptonshire\". \"Queens\" is recorded as used in the \"kings\" area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. \"Kings truce\" is found in Thomas Dekker's \"The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i)\", which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.\n\n\"Crosses\", \"cruces\", \"creases\" and \"cree\" were found in a broad band across England from \"crosses\" in Lincolnshire, \"cruce\" or \"cruces\" from Oxford through to Gloucester, \"creases\" in Berkshire and \"cree\" in South Wales and both sides of the Bristol Channel. There are some areas of \"scruces\", \"screwsies\" or \"screws\" in Essex and Suffolk. The Opies saw \"creases\" as a transitional word.\n\n\"Exes\", used around Ipswich and Norwich, was thought to be a variant of \"crosses\".\n\n\"Bars\" and sometimes \"barsies\" were common in Devon in an otherwise predominantly \"fainites\" area. \"Bar\" was used the other side of the Bristol channel in Swansea.\n\n\"Skinch\" or \"skinge\" predominated in Northumberland and Durham, another term first recorded in a nineteenth-century dialect dictionary.\n\n\"Keys\" was found by the Opies to be the prevailing term in western Scotland and in a strip running through north-west England in an otherwise predominantly \"barley\" area.\n\n\"Scribs\" or \"squibs\" coverered an area from Hampshire, to West Sussex and Surrey. Other Hampshire variants were \"scrims\", \"screens\", \"scrames\", \"screams\", \"creams\" and \"cribs\".\n\n\"Finns\" was used in Guernsey.\n\n\"Pax\", (Latin for \"peace\"), was a group dialect word rather than a regional one as it was predominantly used in private schools and school stories.\n\nMany individual cities, towns and rural districts had their own words, not used elsewhere such as \"bees\", \"blobs\", \"croggies\", \"denny\", \"keppies\", \"locks\", \"peas\", \"peril\", \"nix\", \"truce\", \"snakes\" and \"twigs\".\n\nCertainly the term \"fainlights\" (with crossed fingers of one hand) was used in parts of East London in the 1950's, whereas \"vainlights\" was a truce term of the same period in parts of Surrey.\n\nA study undertaken in Lincolnshire in 1974 confirmed the Opies' findings. However, a later study undertaken in Croydon, Surrey in 1988 found the use of truce terms much less uniform. Croydon is firmly in the \"fainites\" area on the Opies' map, but in 1988 \"fainites\" was only the third most commonly used term. The most common terms were \"pax\" (30%), \"jecs\" (25%), \"fainites\" (20%) and \"cross keys\" (2%). \"Jecs\" is a term not recorded by the Opies at all and there was some evidence that it derived from the word \"injection\". \"Fainites\" was known more than it was used and was reported by one teacher to be \"totally lacking in street credibility\". \"Pax\" was no longer a group word as reported by the Opies. Other terms reported included \"pips\", \"force field\" and \"quits\". The authors concluded that either the Opies had grossly oversimplified the picture or things had radically changed in 30 years (some seven to eight generations of primary school children). They also noted that although some schools reported a marked preference for a particular term, all schools reported at least some children using different terms.\n\nThe Concise Scots Language Dictionary published in 1999, records the use of \"keys\" as a truce term in Fife, south west and west central Scotland.\n\nAccording to researchers from the National Australian Dictionary Centre there is evidence that \"barley\" (Scotland and the west of England), \"barlies\" (Aberdeen and a few English towns), \"bar\" (Swansea) and \"bars\" (Devon), are used in Australia. In Australia the terms are used regionally with Victorians using \"barley\", New South Welshmen using \"bar\" or \"bars\" and the people of Western Australia using \"barlies.\"\n\nA study undertaken between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer on traditional forms of play included truce terms. The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were \"pegs\" (widespread), \"twigs\" (Taranaki), \"gates\" (Auckland), \"tags\" (Nelson Marlborough), and \"nibs\" (Otago-Southland). In Wellington schools the dominant term was \"fans\", recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from \"fains\" or \"fain it\" as described by the Opies, itself dating back to Chaucerian times. The most widespread term was \"pegs\", derived from \"pax\". Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to \"pags\", probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to \"pegs\". The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis for the use of this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools. Similarly they thought \"nibs\" derived from \"nix\", possibly via \"nigs\", originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of \"nicks\" possibly from \"nicklas\". \"Nix\" is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term. \"Nixs\" and \"flix\" were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa, and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an Afrikaans term.\n\nMany of the common truce terms recorded by the Bauers such as \"bags\", \"poison\", \"gates\", \"tags\", \"flicks\", are not listed by the Opies although they speculated that both \"bags\" and \"tags\" may derive from \"pax\".\n\nIn a study undertaken by historians Mary and Herbert Knapp in the 1970s, informants remembering terms from the 1930s reported \"kings X\" and \"kings\". The use of \"kings X\" before the 1930s is well-recorded. The 1985 edition of the \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" records the historical use of \"kings ex\", \"kings sax\", \"kings cruse\", \"kings excuse\" and \"kings\", chiefly west of the Mississippi River, the Gulf States and Ohio Valley. The earliest recorded use cited in the dictionary is of \"kings cruse\" in 1778 during an adult fight.\n\nScholarly speculation in the late nineteenth century postulated that \"kings X\" derived from \"kings truce\", rendered as \"kings cruse\" and then \"kings excuse\", becoming \"kings X\" as a shortened form. The \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" cites the Opies as a source for the derivation of the terms and states that \"exes\" probably refers to the use of crossed fingers, an important part of the demand for a truce, rather than deriving from \"excuse\" as originally thought. However, the Knapps state that although the Opies do not record \"kings X\" as such in the UK, they do record \"kings\", \"crosses\", \"exes\", \"cruse\" and \"truce\". They conclude that \"kings X\" derived from the users of \"kings\" and \"exes\" settling in the same areas of the US—the terms were then combined and shortened. \"Kings cruse\", once popular in the US, might be accounted for in a similar manner. \"Barley\" has been recorded as a truce term in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Virginia.\n\nThe Knapps study in Monroe County, Indiana, found \"time-out\" and \"times\" to be by far the most prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included \"I've got times\" and \"time\". Very few children reported the more traditional \"kings\", \"queens\" or \"I've got kings X\". The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. \"Time-out\" clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of \"time-out\" or \"time\" as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, only a small number of respondents reported anything other than \"time-out\" and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included \"pax\", \"safe\", \"base\" or \"home-base\" and \"freeze\" with one small area of \"fins\" (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that \"time-out\" had, since the 1950s, supplanted \"kings ex\" as the most popular truce term.\n\nThe use of \"times\" rather than \"time-out\" and \"I've got times\" rather than \"I call time\" appears to have been influenced by older forms such as \"kings\" and \"I've got kings X\". There was also one report of \"times X\". Similarly derivatives of \"time-out\" are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.\n\nIn France children use the word \"pouce\" as the equivalent of the English \"pax\" and the American \"time-out\". The literal translation of pouce is thumb or big toe.\n\"Lu !\" is -- or was -- a common truce term in Châteauroux, central France, in the fifties and sixties.\n\nThe Opies found that in England and Wales children usually held up crossed fingers. Sometimes crossing the fingers of both hands was required and occasionally the feet as well. The Opies found one area, Headington, where sitting cross-legged was required. At Lydney, children could raise their right hand palm forward, whilst in Bradford-on-Avon the hand was held up with three fingers extended. In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one's thumbs, sometimes licking them first. This also occurred in a few places in Lancashire. Anecdotally, the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of \"pouce\" in France.\n\nThe 1988 Croydon study found a variety of gestures in common use. These were crossed fingers of one hand (44%), crossed fingers of both hands (26%), thumbs through fingers (6%) (boys only) and arms crossed across the chest (2%). Other gestures, reported in ones and twos, included miming an injection into the arm, licking the thumb, making a T-shape with the hands, three fingers held up and the \"Vulcan\" sign from Star Trek. Virtually all schools reported the use of crossed fingers.\n\nThe holding up of one hand with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying \"time-out\". The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching the bottom of the horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern \"time-out\" has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.\n\n"}

{"id": "17254188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17254188", "title": "Kiribath", "text": "Kiribath\n\nKiribath () is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from rice. It is prepared by cooking rice with coconut milk, hence this name, and can be considered a form of rice cake or rice pudding. Kiribath is an essential dish in Sri Lankan cuisine. It is very commonly served for breakfast on the first day of each month and also has added significance of being eaten for any auspicious moment throughout one's lifetime which are marking times of transition. It is one of the more renowned traditional dishes in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe word is a compound with a transparent meaning in the Sinhala language, where \"kiri\" (කිරි) means \"milk\" and \"bath\" ( බත්) means \"rice\".\n\nThe origins of Kiribath are not clear, although the dish seems to be unique to Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is said that Sujata offered kiribath to Gautama Buddha whilst he was meditating under the Bodhi Tree, just before attaining enlightenment.\n\nIt has now become a traditional dish and is common in almost every household in Sri Lanka, be it rich or poor.\n\nIn a Sinhalese home, and during Sinhalese holidays and ceremonies kiribath plays a significant role. The dish celebrates festive or auspicious occasions and symbolises the beginning of new pursuits or transitions in life. Traditionally it is also eaten by families on the first day of each month.\n\nKiribath has a very important role for the Sinhalese in celebrating the Sinhalese New Year where it will be consumed as the first meal of the year. At the dawn of the new year, a hearth within the household is lit by the lady of the house and the traditional pot of kiribath is boiled. Sometimes rice that has been kept especially for this occasion will be used, as this occasion requires the best rice, which is expressed in terms of taste. When the cooking is finished, after a series of observances and rituals the family begins to eat, but not before making an offering to the Buddha and gods first. The family will eat from the same rice, as if they are symbolically dining together with the Buddha and the deities. During the Sinhalese New Year, or on any other special occasion, kiribath will be served as the main dish and centrepiece of the meal. At the table, kiribath is served alongside traditional sweets like Kevum, Kokis, bananas and many other delicacies. After this, the oil lamp is lit and the first meal of the year commences. The kiribath symbolises life and so it is fed to the rest of the family by the head of the family, either the father or the mother, to their progenitors for the New Year.\n\nKiribath is traditionally the first solid food fed to an infant.\n\nKiribath is fed by bridegrooms to brides at their wedding.\n\nKiribath is typically prepared from four basic components: white short grain rice, thick coconut milk or basic milk, water and salt to taste.\n\nChoosing the right variety of rice is critical in cooking the dish well. Long grain rice or medium grain rice are not the best choices for making this dish. Traditionally, it is prepared with a rice variety known as rathu haal or rathu kakulu haal for its neutral flavour and good cooking qualities. Any starchy and sticky rice variety works best. For the rice to set properly, the texture of the cooked rice is very important. Due to some difficult to source the Sri Lankan rice variety in the southern parts of Sri Lanka, the locals might use the red rice.\n\nThe recipe for Kiribath is fairly simple. The rice is cooked in boiling water for about fifteen minutes, the coconut milk is added and cooked again until the liquid is absorbed. Salt is also added when cooking. However, there are some variations to this where different ingredients are added, such as sesame seeds or cashew. \nThe common method of serving Kiribath is once it has cooled and set on a plate, it is compressed and cut into diamond or square shaped blocks.\n\nHistorically Kiribath had been cooked in earthen clay pots in firewood hearths, this cooking method would impart a unique flavour to the dish.\n\nKiribath is usually served with Lunu miris, a relish made of red onions, mixed with chili flakes, Maldive fish, salt, and lime. It can also be consumed with Seeni sambol, jaggery and bananas.\n\nAlthough served onto the plate with a spoon, kiribath is traditionally eaten by hand as it is the best way to mix with the Lunu miris.\n\nThere are variations of kiribath including:\n\nMung kiribath (මුං කිරිබත්)is a variation of Kiribath is made by adding boiled Green Gram to the Milk Rice. The same recipe and procedure can be followed to make this variation. It is often prepared in Buddhist temples.\n\nImbul kiribath (ඉඹුල් කිරිබත්) is a sweet variation of the original. It is made by taking the a small amount of kiribath, made in the regular process, and spreading it on a banana leaf. A sweet filling made of coconut and jaggery, called Pani pol, is placed in the center. The banan leaf is folded and rolled vertically and pressed firm giving it its unusual cylindrical shape.\n\n"}

Ingredient labels do not list from which type of tree acorns are gathered, most likely owing to the large number of oak species and increasing oak hybridization (especially among white oak varieties), which makes it difficult to recognise and document each type of species.\n\nEvidence at Neolithic sites such as Amsa-dong in South Korea show acorns were part of the human diet. Acorns contain bitter tannins which would have been leached out to make the acorns edible. They were then ground into flour using a saddle quern and milling stone.\n\nIt is unknown exactly where acorn noodles were first produced. However, Ogam village, Korea is well known for a long history of acorn cultivation. The village's location by the Namhangang River and its mountainous climate and landscape is conducive toward large-scale acorn cultivation. The village produces dozens of acorn-based foods, including \"dotori kalguksoo\" (acorn knife-cut noodles). \n\nThere are two varieties of acorn noodles: flour-based soba and starch-based vermicelli.\n\nAcorn vermicelli noodles or \"dotori naengmyeon\" (hangul: 냉면 도토리) are made from acorn starch and some combination of potato, rice, or arrowroot starch, wheat flour, and salt. The dried noodles resemble brown plastic threads about 1/10-1/8 cm in diameter. Cooked properly and typically eaten cold, acorn-based \"naengmyeon\" noodles have a high elasticity and chewy consistency.\n\nAcorn soba noodles or in Korean, \"dotori guksu\" (hangul: 도토리국수) are made from acorn flour and a combination of grain-based flours; such as buckwheat and corn, and salt. They are about as thick as spaghetti and are used in hot and cold dishes, such as Zaru Soba (boiled noodles are served cold with a dipping sauce.) Acorn soba noodles may be more healthy than the starch-based acorn vermicelli noodles. The Japanese version of these noodles, \"donguri-men\" (Japanese:どんぐり), typically has less acorn flour than the original Korean version.\n\nRaw acorn noodles are slightly coarser in cut and texture and more brittle than standard buckwheat soba noodles. Cooked acorn soba noodles are nuttier in flavor, healthier, and slightly saltier than buckwheat noodles. In particular, they contain many antioxidants and could be considered an adaptogenic food.\n\nA common problem among Korean-manufactured products is that their ingredient labels are often not properly translated. Acorn starch is frequently mislabeled as acorn flour or acorn powder. In reality, acorn starch is essentially highly refined acorn flour, devoid of fiber, fat, and almost all nutrition. While the acorn itself does indeed contain acorn starch, that starch is not highly refined. Acorn starch, in contrast, is extracted from the meat of the kernel using a wet process and then dehydrated. The heart, or germ, of the kernel is removed and used for producing acorn oil, which is comparable in flavor and quality to olive oil. The hull is separated from the kernel meat, and the starch is extracted from the kernel meat. It might be more accurate to use the term “acorn meal”, although a meal is a coarser, less refined version of flour.\n\nBoth flour and starch-based acorn noodles are available in upscale Korean markets. A few Japanese markets also carry acorn soba noodles, but in general, acorn soba noodles are difficult to find.\n\n\n"}
