An author of a tafsir is a (; plural: ). A Qur'anic tafsir attempts to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God's will.\n\nPrincipally, a tafsir deals with the issues of linguistics, jurisprudence, and theology. In terms of perspective and approach, tafsir can be broadly divided into two categories, namely \"tafsir bi-al-ma'thur\" (lit. received tafsir), which is transmitted from the early days of Islam through the prophet Muhammad and his companions, and \"tafsir bi-al-ra'y\" (lit. tafsir by opinion), which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking.\n\nThere are different characteristics and traditions for each of the tafsirs representing respective schools and doctrines, namely Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, and Sufism. There are also general distinctions between classic tafsirs compiled by authoritative figures of Muslim scholarship during the formative ages of Islam, and modern tafsir which seeks to address a wider audience, including the common people.\n\nThe word ' is derived from the three-letter Arabic verbal root of \"F-S-R\" (', 'interpret'). In its literal meaning, the word refers to interpreting, explaining, expounding, or disclosing. In Islamic contexts, it is defined as understanding and uncovering God's will which has been conveyed by the Qur'anic text, by means of the Arabic language and one's own knowledge.\n\nThe first examples of tafsir can be traced back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. As the Qur'an was revealed to him, he recited the verses to his companions, usually explaining their meanings to teach them, as it was one of Muhammad's responsibilities. Elements of Muhammad's explanations including clarifying verses whose intents are not understood, the indication of names, places, times etc. which have not been mentioned in the verse, restriction of meanings which have been given as absolute and reconciliation of expressions which seem contradictory. Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives (\"hadith\"), thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad, his companions (\"sahabah\") undertook the task of interpretation, thus starting a new age in tafsir. Most of the sahabah, including Abu Bakr, refrained from commenting based on their personal views, and only narrated comments by Muhammad. Others including ibn Abbas used their own knowledge from the Arabic language to interpret the Qur'an. At this stage, tafsir was selective and concise regarding its coverage, and only certain words, phrases and verses were explained. The Qur'an was still not fully interpreted, and commentaries were not separated from the hadith collection nor written separately, mainly due to other occupations such as the collection of the Qur'an.\n\nBy the time of the next generations ensuing the sahabah, scholars in the age of the successors (\"tabi'in\") started using a wide range of sources for tafsir. The whole of the Qur'an is interpreted, and narrations are separated from tafsir into separate books and literature. Grammatical explanations and historical data are preserved within these books; personal opinions are recorded, whether accepted or rejected. During this time, a whole range of schools of tafsir came into existence in different scholastic centers, including Mecca, Medina and Iraq. Iraqi schools of tafsir came to be known for an approach relied on personal judgment aside from the transmitted reports, and Jewish apocryphal reports were also widely employed. Notable compilers on this age including Sufyan al-Thawri.\n\nUntil this age, tafsir had been transmitted orally and had not been collected independently in a book, rather, they had been gathered by \"muhaddithun\" (lit. scholars of hadith) in their hadith books, under the topic of tafsir, along with other narrations of Muhammad. This indicates that tafsir, in its formative age, used to be a special domain within hadith. Widening of the scope of tafsir and emergence of \"mufassirun\" in the age of the successors lead to the development of an independent discipline of tafsir.\n\nAn author of tafsir is a (; plural: ). According to Sunni Islamic scholar Al-Suyuti, mufassirs are required to master 15 fields from different disciplines such as linguistics, rhetoric, theology and jurisprudence before one can authoritatively interpret the Qur'an. The foremost discipline that constitutes the basis of tafsir learning is Arabic language. Arabic in this context specifically means Classical Arabic. One of the earliest Islamic scholars Mujahid ibn Jabr said, “It is not permissible for one who holds faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment to speak on the Qur'an without learning classical Arabic.” Especially relevant expertise is how one learns the meaning of each word. In this respect, it should be known that classical Arabic must be mastered in its entirety because one word may have various meanings; a person may only know two or three of them whereas the meaning of that word in the Qur'an may be altogether different. Other fields related to Arabic language includes Philology of Arabic. It is important because any change in the diacritical marks affects the meaning, and understanding the diacritical marks depends on the science of Arabic philology. Morphology of Arabic language is also important because changes in the configuration of verb and noun forms change the meaning. Ibn Faris said, “A person who misses out on Arabic morphology has missed out on a lot.” Lastly, \"Al-Ishtiqaaq\" is the science of etymology which explains the reciprocal relation and radical composition between the root and derived word. It should be learned because sometimes one word derives from two root words, the meaning of each root word being different. For example, a word \"masih\" derives from the root word \"masah\" which means “to feel something and to touch something with a wet hand,” but also derives from the root word \"masaahat\" which means “to measure.”\n\nAnother relevant discipline is the science of interpreting the Arabic sentence. \"Ilm al-Ma’ani\" is the science by which one figures the syntax through the meaning of a sentence. \"Ilm al-Bayaan\" is the science by which one learns the similes, metaphors, metonymies, \"zuhoor\" (evident meanings) and \"khafa\" (hidden meanings) of the Arabic language. \"Ilm al-Badi’\" is the science by which one learns to interpret sentences in which the beauty and eloquence of the spoken and written word are considered hidden. The above-mentioned three sciences are categorized as \"Ilm-ul-Balagha\" (science of rhetoric). It is one of the most principal sciences to a mufassir as it is deemed by Muslims that there are literal and non-literal meanings of the Qur'an, and one is able to reveal the miraculous nature of the Qur'an through these three sciences. A field from Qur'anic teaching is called \"Ilm al-Qira'at\". This is a system of dialecticism of the different readings of the Qur'an. This science is important because one \"qira'at\" (way of reading) of the Qur'an may differ in meaning from another, and one learns to favor one reading over another based on the difference in the meanings.\n\nGeneral sciences of Islamic theology and Islamic study are also imperative. \"Ilm al-Aqa'id\" and \"Ilm al-Kalam\" are comprehensive sciences in Islamic theology and philosophy. They are important because upon these understandings, one may understand issues such as invalidity of attributing the literal meaning of some ayah to God. In this case, one will be required to interpret the ayah as in ‘the hand of Allah is over their hand’. Other key issues required to be addressed through comprehension of theology and philosophy includes that of free will and determinism, or the infallibility of the prophets. Comprehension of \"Fiqh\", Islamic jurisprudence, is important because one cannot gain an overview of any issue until he has understood its particulars. \"Usul al-Fiqh\", principles of Islamic jurisprudence, is also required so one understands the methodology of legal derivation and interpretation.\n\nOther distinctive systems linked with tafsir study including \"Asbaab al-Nuzul\", which is the field by which one learns the circumstances in which an ayah is revealed. It is important because the meaning of the ayah is more clearly understood once the circumstances in which it was revealed are known. Sometimes, the meaning of an ayah is wholly dependent on its historical background. Another is \"Ilm-ul-Naskh\", which is knowledge of the abrogated ayah. In general, due to the Qur'an made up of revelations that revealed to Muhammad in the course of more than twenty years, certain verses are considered meant to be temporary and subsequently repealed by the following ones. \"Ilm-ul-Nashkh\" is a science of identifying the abrogations, and it is important because abrogated rulings must be separated from the applied rulings. \"Ilm al-Hadith\" is knowledge of the hadith which explain \"mujmal\" (general) ayah, and \"Ilm al-Ladunni\" is the endowed knowledge which is considered granted by God to his closest servants. This is for example a knowledge obtained directly from Allah through inspiration. They are the servants indicated in the hadith: \"Allah will grant one who acts upon whatever he knows from a knowledge he never knew.\"\n\nThere are several frames of reference in which tafsir can be categorized. The main issue of framing constitutes its methodology. Tafsir can be broadly divided into two categories from the viewpoint of methodology employed in order to approach the interpretation. These categories are called \"tafsir bi-al-ma'thur\" (, also known as \"tafsir bi-al-riwaya\" ) and \"tafsir bi-al-ra'y\" (, also known as \"tafsir bi-al-diraya\" ).\n\n\"Tafsir bi-al-ma'thur\", or commonly known as \"tafsir bi-al-riwaya\", is the method of commenting on the Qur'an using traditional sources. \"Tafsir bi-al-riwaya\" connotes tafsir using another portion of the Qur'an, or sayings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, or saying of his companions. This classical tafsir method is agreed upon by all scholars, and is the most used method throughout history, partly because other methods have been criticized. Criticism of non-riwaya method is mostly based on two grounds; for one, the Prophet has condemned those who interpret the Qur'an from their own point of view, and for two, most companions of the Prophet have refrained from presenting their own ideas. Some important examples of tafsir bi-al-riwaya are \"Jāmiʿ al-Bayān\" by al-Tabari and \"Tafseer al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓeem\" by ibn Kathir. The sources used for tafsir bi-al-riwaya can be ordered by the rank of authority, as the Qur'an, Hadith, the report by Sahaba and Tabi'iun, classical Arabic literature, and Isra'iliyat.\n\nThe most authoritative source of the interpretation is the Qur'an itself. Interpretation of the Qur'an employing other Qur'anic reference is very common because of the close interrelatedness of the verses of the Qur'an with one another. The Qur'anic verses explain and interpret one another, which leads many to believe that it has the highest level of authenticity. Many verses or words in the Qur'an are explained or further clarified in other verses of the Qur'an. One example of the hadith which extensively employs this source of method is \"Al-Mizan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an\" by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i. The authoritative source of method second to the Qur'an is Hadith, by using narratives of Muhammad to interpret the Qur'an. In this approach the most important external aids used are the collected oral traditions upon which Muslim scholars based Islamic history and law. Authority of this method is considered established by the statement made in the Qur'an that Muhammad is responsible for explanation and guidance. While some narratives are of revelation origin, others can be the result of reasonings made by Muhammad. One important aspect of these narratives is their origin. Narratives used for tafsir, and in general, must be of authentic origin (\"sahih\"). Narratives of such origin are considered requisite for tafsir.\n\nOther source of the interpretation includes the accounts of \"Ṣaḥābah\", companions of Muhammad, or \"tabi‘un\", the generation after sahabah, and \"Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in\", the generation after tabi'un. Their authority is based on an account in hadith \"Sahih Bukhari\", which accordingly, Muhammad said; \"\"The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them (Tābi‘un), and then those coming after (the second generation)\"\". If nothing is found in the Qur'an or the Hadīth, the commentator has recourse to what the Ṣaḥābah reported about various verses. These are generally considered above personal opinion, because these people grew up with everyday interaction with Muhammad, and had often asked about the meanings of verses or circumstances of their revelation; and they were very knowledgeable in both Arabic literature and Islamic thought. Another non-scripture based source of the interpretation is classical Arabic literature. Classical Arabic poetry and the text of the Qur'an are two resources which can be used as foundational reference in ascertaining the meaning and signification of the remaining literal and figurative diction of the Qur'an and its style of expression. Using Arabic poetry for defining words is a long used practice, in fact there are very few scholars who haven't used this source. Less authoritative source of the interpretation is \"Isra'iliyat\", which is the body of narratives originating from Judeo-Christian traditions, rather than from other well-accepted sources. The Isra'iliyat are mostly non-biblical explanatory stories and traditions (Hebrew: \"midrashim\") giving extra information or interpretation about events or individuals recorded in the Hebrew scriptures. Scholars starting with the Sahabah have studied narrative accounts of other Abrahamic religions to further explain and clarify verses, especially parables, in the Qur'an. While some may be accurate, these narratives are not subject to hadith authenticity criteria, and are generally not favored for use.\n\n\"Tafsir bi-al-ra'y\", or commonly known as \"tafsir bi-al-diraya\", is the method of using one's independent rational reasoning and mind (\"ijtihad\") to form an opinion-oriented interpretation. The most distinctive feature of tafsir bi-al-diraya is the inclusion of the opinions of the commentator, thus forming the more objective view on Qur'anic verses. The relative paucity of traditional sources is also a practical reason why the scope of the methodology is augmented. This is considered sanctioned by the Qur'an itself, as written in the surah Sad verse 29: This method is not interpretation by mere opinion however, but rather opinions must be based on the main sources. Performing Qur'anic interpretation using solely one's own opinion is believed to be prohibited by some Muslims. This is based on an authenticated hadith of Muhammad which states; \"\"He who says (something) concerning the Qur'ân without knowledge, he has taken his seat of fire\"\"'. However, this hadith can alternatively be interpreted to refer to the importance of first properly studying and learning the Qur'an before attempting to teach or preach it to others. Accordingly, the method of independent reasoning (\"ijtihad\") has several qualifications and conditions that need to be satisfied. Due to the nature of orientation toward opinions, this method is rejected by certain scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, and prohibited by Wahhabi Islamic doctrine. Some important examples of such tafsirs include \"Anwar al-Tanzil\" by al-Baydawi and \"Mafatih al-Ghayb\" by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Some parameters used by these scholars including linguistic resources, historical sources, methodological concepts such as \"maqasid\" or socio-cultural environment taken into consideration.\n\nIn terms of linguistic resources, literary elements of the Arabic language, including morphology, eloquence, syntax are an integral part of tafsir, as they constitute the basis of understanding and interpretation. Arabic has a systematic way of shaping words so one can know the meaning by knowing the root and the form the word was coined from. If any word can be given a meaning that is compatible with the rules of grammar, Qur'anic text can be interpreted that way. In terms of historical resources, scholars may choose to interpret verses according to external factors, including their historical context and their place of revelation. Historical context (\"Asbab al-nuzul\") is particularly important to interpret verses according to how the Qur'an was revealed, when and under which circumstances, and much commentary was dedicated to history. The early tafsirs are considered to be some of the best sources for Islamic history. Classification of the place of revelation, whether it was revealed in Mecca or Medina, is important as well. This is because in general Meccan verses tend to have an \"iman\" (loosely translated as \"faith\") nature that includes believing in Allah, the Prophet and the day of judgment, whether it be theological foundations or basic faith principles. On the other hand, Medinan verses constitute legislation, social obligations, and constitution of a state.\n\nOn the more conceptual level, the idea of \"maqasid\" (goals or purpose) can be taken into account. Verses may be interpreted to preserve the general goals of shariah, which may be considered simply as bringing happiness to a person in this life and the hereafter. That way, any interpretation that threatens to compromise the preservation of religion, life, lineage, intellect or property may be discarded or ruled otherwise in order to secure these goals. Further, the socio-cultural environment may also taken into consideration. This includes understanding and interpreting the Qur'an while taking into account the cultural and social environment to which it has been revealed; or according to the scholars' own time. Often than not, the distinction can be made between the \"'amm\" (general) verses that aimed at universal conditions for Muslims, and \"khass\" (specific) verses that applied to specific conditions, time or need. This is considered an integral part of analyzing the universality of the Qur'an. Scholars usually do not favor to confine verses to a single time interval, but rather interpret according to the needs of their time.\n\nIslamic theology is divided into myriad of schools and branches, and each of the schools comments on the Qur'an with their own point of view.\n\nRegarding sunni tafsir, it seems that Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari and Ibn Taimiyya serve as transition points. The time of Tabari marks the classical period, which encompased important Sunni tafsirs, such as Tafsir al-Thalabi, Tafsir of Al-Zamakhshari and Tafsir al-Tabari. Tafsir al-Tabari is one of the most important tafsir works in Sunni-Islam. This work provides exegetical material for the whole Quran, also contains conflicting information, which Tabari tries either to harmonize or argue in support of the one he feels more correct. Further he includes different readings, which according to him, both might be correct and given his own opinion after each argumentation. Both linguistical and theological subjects are discussed throughout his work.\n\nThe post-classical period is marked by the exegetic methodology of Ibn Taimiyya and Ibn Kathir. Although ibn Kathir claimed to rely on the works of Tabari, he introduced new methods to for his exegesis, based on the teachings of Ibn Taimiyya. His monovalency and rejection of \"Isra'iliyyat\" are significant for his tafsir. It is much more selective, than previous tafsir. Intellectual disciplines of grammar, law and theology brought into debate did no longer played a role in Quranic exegesis. His straight approach is probably for its high regard in contemporary scholarship and is especially rewarded in Salafism.\n\nTafsir by Shia Islam similarly deals with the issues concerned by Sunnis, and employs similar methodology as well, except for the adherence toward certain beliefs and creeds Shiism espouses. Distinctive features of Shia tafsirs include expounding of the concept of imamate, the heavier weight put on verses that considered to be the foundation of successorship to Muhammad within the Prophet's family begins with Ali, and the heavier authority put on interpretations attributed to The Twelve Imams. These characteristics result in distinction being made between the esoteric and the exoteric meaning of the Qur'an, and the esoteric meaning attributed to the imams preferred over the exoteric meaning. Certain Shia tafsirs are influenced by Mu'tazili thoughts as well, specifically on the theological issues. On the other hand, tafsir by Zaidi school of jurisprudence, which espouses the doctrine closest with Sunnis of all Shia sects, produces tafsir resembling Sunni tafsir in its quality. Some Zaidi tafsirs are considered popular among Sunnis as well. Some of the important examples of Shia mufassirs and its tafsir are \"Al-Tibbyan Fi Tafsir al-Quran\" by Shaykh Tusi (460/1067), and \"Majma al-Bayan lif'ulum al-Quran\" by Shaykh Tabarsi (d. 548/1153).\n\nThe Mu'tazila tradition of tafsir has received little attention in modern scholarship, owing to several reasons. First, \"Al-Kashshaaf\" by al-Zamakhshari is the only traditional tafsir from the Mu'tazilite school which is available in a published form. It is narrower in scope than major tafsir works, concentrating mainly on grammar and language, and to some extent on theology. Secondly, several exegetical works by Mu'tazila scholars have been studied as books on theology rather than as works of tafsir. Thirdly, the large Mu'tazilite tafsir \"at-Tahdib fi tafsir al-Qur'an\" by al-Hakim al-Jishumi has not been edited, and there is no complete copy of it available at any single location, which limits its accessibility to scholars.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya movement has published a number of Quran commentaries, these include \"Tafseer-e-Kabeer\" by Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad (Urdu-10 Volumes) and \"Haqaiq al-furqan\" by Hakeem Noor-ud-Din (Urdu-4 volumes). Ahmadi interpretation of the Qur'an reflects their distinctive worldviews on Islamic philosophy and theology, such as rejection of abrogation of the verses and particular emphasis on harmony between the Qur'an as the \"word of God\" and science as the \"work of God\".\n\nIt is an interpretation of the Qur'an which includes attribution of esoteric or mystic meanings to the text by the interpreter. In this respect, its method is different from the conventional exegesis. Esoteric interpretations do not usually contradict the conventional (in this context called exoteric) interpretations; instead, they discuss the inner levels of meaning of the Qur'an. A hadith from Muhammad which states that the Qur'an has an inner meaning, and that this inner meaning conceals a yet deeper inner meaning, and so on (up to seven levels of meaning), has sometimes been used in support of this view. Islamic opinion imposes strict limitations on esoteric interpretations specially when interior meaning is against exterior one. Esoteric interpretations are found mainly in Sufism and in the sayings (hadiths) of Shi'a Imams and the teachings of the Isma'ili sect. But the Prophet and the imams gave importance to its exterior as much as to its interior; they were as much concerned with its revelation as they were with its interpretation. These are generally not independently written, however they are found in the books of Sufis. Some examples are \"Hakaik al-tafsir\" by Sulemi, and \"Tafseer-e-Rafai\" by Faqeer Syed Muhammad Rafai Arab.\n\nScholars deeply influenced by the natural and social sciences followed the materialists of Europe or the pragmatists. Under the influence of those secular theories, they declared that the religion's realities cannot go against scientific knowledge. What the religion claims to exist, but which the sciences reject should be interpreted in a way that conforms with the science; as for those things which the science is silent about, like the resurrection etc., they should be brought within the purview of the laws of matter; the pillars upon which the divine religious laws are based — like revelation, angel, Satan, prophethood, apostleship, Imamah (Imamate) etc. - are spiritual things, and the spirit is a development of the matter. As for the Qur'an itself, one should not explain it in the light of the old philosophy and theories, because they were not based on observations and tests — they were just a sort of mental exercise which has been totally discredited now by the modem science. Found by Ghazali and built upon by Razi, it is one of today's most abundant way of tafsir. Common examples are \"Mafatih al-Ghayb\" by Fakhruddin al-Razi, and \"Tafhim-ul-Quran\" by Abul A'la Maududi.\n\nThe philosophers try to fit the verses on the principles of Greek philosophy. If a verse was clearly against those principles it was explained away. In this way the verses describing metaphysical subjects, those explaining the genesis and creation of the heavens and the earth, those concerned with life after death and those about resurrection, paradise and hell were distorted to conform with the said philosophy. That philosophy was admittedly only a set of conjectures — unencumbered with any test or proof; but the Muslim philosophers felt no remorse in treating its views on the system of skies, orbits, natural elements and other related subjects as the absolute truth with which the exegesis of the Qur'an had to conform.\n\nFiqhi tafsir deals mainly with verses that have a legislative meaning (see ahkam), and it strives to obtain Islamic law from the Qur'an. It is a very common school classically and modernly. There is a dispute over the number of verses that contain jurisprudence, numbers ranging from 5 to 200 are reported. Some works part of this school are \"Aḥkam al-Qur'an\" by al-Jassas, and \"Aḥkam al-Qur'an\" by Qaḍi Abū Bakr ibn al-'Arabī.\n\nA newer work which incorporates and quotes the work of a multitude of previous scholars and analyzes the relevant Arabic root words (based on all available classic Arabic meanings), and references all relevant passages of the Quran, was done by Abdul Mannan Omar.\n\n"}

Individual pieces of \"tagliatelle\" are long, flat ribbons that are similar in shape to fettuccine and are typically about wide. \"Tagliatelle\" can be served with a variety of sauces, though the classic is a meat sauce or Bolognese sauce. Tagliolini is another variety of tagliatelle that is long and cylindrical in shape, not long and flat.\n\nBoth tagliolini and tagliatelle are made with egg pasta. The traditional ratio is one egg to one hundred grams of flour.\n\nBavette are also available, and are thinner than tagliatelle; an even thinner version is bavettine.\n\nLegend has it that tagliatelle was created by a talented court chef, who was inspired by Lucrezia d'Este's hairdo on the occasion of her marriage to Annibale II Bentivoglio, in 1487. In reality, this was a joke invented by humorist Augusto Majani in 1931.\n\nThe recipe was called \"tagliolini di pasta e sugo, alla maniera di Zafiran\" (tagliolini of pasta and sauce in the manner of Zafiran) and it was served on silver plates.

Although the range of procedures performed by interventional radiologists is broad, the unifying concept behind these procedures is the application of image guidance and minimally invasive techniques in order to minimize risk to the patient.\n\nTraining for interventional radiology occurs in the residency portion of medical education, and has gone through developments.\n\nIn 2000, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) created a program named \"Clinical Pathway in IR\", which modified the \"Holman Pathway\" that was already accepted by the American Board of Radiology to including training in IR; this was accepted by ABR but was not widely adopted. In 2005 SIR proposed and ABR accepted another pathway called \"DIRECT (Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Enhanced Clinical Training) Pathway\" to help trainees coming from other specialities learn IR; this too was not widely adopted. In 2006 SIR proposed a pathway resulting in certification in IR as a speciality; this was eventually accepted by the ABR in 2007 and was presented to the American Board of Medical Specialities (ABMS) in 2009, which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology (DR) training. The proposal was reworked, at the same time that overall DR training was being revamped, and a new proposal that would lead to a dual DR/IR specialization was presented to the ABMS and was accepted in 2012 and eventually was implemented in 2014. By 2016 the field had determined that the old IR fellowships would be terminated by 2020.\n\nA handful of programs have offered interventional radiology fellowships that focus on training in the treatment of children.\n\nIn Europe the field followed its own pathway; for example in Germany the parallel interventional society began to break free of the DR society in 2008. In the UK, interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010. While many countries have an interventional radiology society, there is also the European-wide Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe, whose aim is to support teaching, science, research and clinical practice in the field by hosting meetings, educational workshops and promoting patient safety initiatives. Furthermore, the Society provides an examination, the European Board of Interventional Radiology (EBIR), which is a highly valuable qualification in interventional radiology based on the European Curriculum and Syllabus for IR.\n\nInterventional radiologists commonly perform both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, although diagnostic angiography is becoming less common as the quality and reliability of CT and MRI angiography has allowed for alternative forms of non invasive evaluation.\n\n\n\"Vascular\"\n\n\"Biliary intervention\"\n\n\"Catheter placement\"\n\n\"Ablative\"\n\n\"Genitourinary\"\n\n\"Pain management\"\n\n"}
{"id": "457621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457621", "title": "Bollocks", "text": "Bollocks\n\n\"Bollocks\" is a word of Middle English origin, meaning \"testicles\". The word is often used figuratively in colloquial British English and Hiberno-English as a noun to mean \"nonsense\", an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to mean \"poor quality\" or \"useless\". Similarly, common phrases like \"\"Bollocks\" to this!\" and \"That's a load of old \"bollocks\"\" generally indicate contempt for a certain task, subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as \"the dog's \"bollocks\"\" or more simply \"the \"bollocks\"\" (as opposed to just \"\"bollocks\"\"), which will refer to something which is admired, approved of or well-respected.\n\nThe word has a long history, with the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) giving examples of its usage dating back to the 13th century. One of the early references is Wycliffe's Bible (1382), Leviticus xxii, 24: \"Al beeste, that ... kitt and taken awey the \"ballokes\" is, ye shulen not offre to the Lord ...\" (any beast that is cut and taken away the \"bollocks\", you shall not offer to the Lord, i.e. castrated animals are not suitable as sacrifices).\n\nThe OED states (with abbreviations expanded): \"Probably a derivative of Teutonic \"ball-\", of which the Old English representative would be inferred as \"beall-u\", \"-a\", or \"-e\"\". The Teutonic \"ball-\" in turn probably derives from the Proto-Indo-European base \"*bhel-\", to inflate or swell. This base also forms the root of many other words, including \"phallus\".\n\nFrom the 17th to the 19th century, \"bollocks\" or \"ballocks\" was allegedly used as a slang term for a clergyman, although this meaning is not mentioned by the OED's 1989 edition. For example, in 1864, the Commanding Officer of the Straits Fleet regularly referred to his chaplain as \"\"Ballocks\"\". It has been suggested that \"bollocks\" came to have its modern meaning of \"nonsense\" because clergymen were notorious for talking nonsense during their sermons.\n\nOriginally, the word \"bollocks\" was the everyday vernacular word for testicles—as noted above, it was used in this sense in the first English-language bible, in the 14th century. By the mid-17th century, at least, it had begun to acquire coarse figurative meanings (see section on \"bollocking\"), for example in a translation of works by Rabelais.\n\nIt did not appear in Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary of the English language. It was also omitted from the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary and its 1941 reprint, finally appearing in the 1972 supplement. The first modern English dictionary to include an entry for \"bollocks\" was G. N. Garmonsway's Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.\n\nThe relative severity of the various profanities, as perceived by the British public, was studied on behalf of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission, BBC and Advertising Standards Authority. The results of this jointly commissioned research were published in December 2000 in a paper called \"Delete Expletives?\". This placed \"bollocks\" in eighth position in terms of its perceived severity, between \"prick\" (seventh place) and \"arsehole\" (ninth place). By comparison, the word \"balls\" (which has some similar meanings) was down in 22nd place. Of the people surveyed, 25% thought that \"bollocks\" should not be broadcast at all, and only 11% thought that it could acceptably be broadcast at times before the national 9 pm \"watershed\" on television (radio does not have a watershed). 25% of the people regarded \"bollocks\" as \"very severe\", 32% \"quite severe\", 34% \"mild\" and 8% considered it \"not swearing\".\n\nA survey of the language of London teenagers (published in 2002) examined, amongst other things, the incidence of various swearwords in their speech. It noted that the top ten swearwords make up 81% of the total swearwords. \"Bollocks\" was the seventh most frequent swearword, after \"fucking\", \"shit\", \"fuck\", \"bloody\", \"hell\" and \"fuck off\". Below \"bollocks\" were \"bastard\", \"bitch\" and \"damn\", in eighth, ninth and tenth places. This research regarded these words as swearwords in the context of their usage but noted that some might be inoffensive in other contexts.\n\n\"Talking \"bollocks\"\" generally means talking nonsense or \"bullshit\", for example: \"Don't listen to him, he's talking \"bollocks\"\", or \"... talking absolute \"bollocks\"\". Another example is \"I told Maurice that he was talking bollocks, that he was full of shit and that his opinions were a pile of piss. (Rhetoric was always my indulgence.)\" \"Talking \"bollocks\"\" in a corporate context is referred to as \"bollockspeak\". \"Bollockspeak\" tends to be buzzword-laden and largely content-free, like gobbledygook: \"Rupert, we'll have to leverage our synergies to facilitate a paradigm shift by Q4\" is an example of management \"bollockspeak\". There is a whole parodic book entitled \"The Little Book of Management Bollocks\". When a great deal of bollocks is being spoken, it may be said that the 'bollocks quotient' is high.\n\nComparable to \"cock-up\", \"screw-up\", \"balls-up\", etc. Used with the indefinite article, it means a disaster, a mess or a failure. It is often used pejoratively, as in to have \"made a \"bollocks\" out of it\", and it is generally used throughout Britain and Ireland.\n\n\"To bollocks something up\" means \"to mess something up\". It refers to a botched job: \"Well, you \"bollocksed\" it up that time, Your Majesty!\" or \"\"Bollocksed\" up at work again, I fear. Millions down the drain\".\n\n\"To \"drop a bollock\"\" describes the malfunction of an operation, or messing something up, as in many sports, and in more polite business parlance, \"dropping the ball\" brings play to an unscheduled halt.\n\nA \"\"bollocking\"\" usually denotes a robust verbal chastisement for something which one has done (or not done, as the case may be), for instance: \"I didn't do my homework and got a right \"bollocking\" off Mr Smith\", or \"A nurse was assisting at an appendix operation when she shouldn't have been ... and the surgeon got a \"bollocking\"\". Actively, one \"gives\" or \"delivers\" a bollocking to someone; in the building trade one can 'throw a right bollocking into' someone.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary gives the earliest meaning as \"to slander or defame\" and suggests that it entered the English language from the 1653 translation of one of Rabelais' works, which includes the Middle French expression \"en couilletant\", translated as \"ballocking\". The earliest printed use in the sense of a severe reprimand is, according to the OED, from 1946.\n\n\"Bollocking\" can also be used as a reinforcing adjective: \"He hasn't a \"bollocking\" clue!\" or \"Where's me \"bollocking\" car?\"\n\n\"\"A kick in the bollocks\"\" is used to describe a significant set-back or disappointment, e.g. \"I was diagnosed with having skin cancer. Ye Gods! What a kick in the bollocks\".\n\nTo freeze one's bollocks off means to be very cold. To \"work ones bollocks off\" is to work very hard. This phrase is sometimes used by or about women: Boy George referred to his mother \"\"working her bollocks off\"\" at home.\n\n\"\"Bollock naked\"\" is used in the singular form to emphasise being completely nude: \"he was completely pissed and stark \"bollock naked\"\".\n\nIn Ireland, \"\"bollocks\"\", \"\"ballocks\"\" or \"\"bollox\"\" can be used as a singular noun to mean a despicable or notorious person, for instance: \"Who's the old \"ballocks\" you were talking to?\", or conversely as a very informal term of endearment: \"Ah Ted, ye big \"bollocks\", let's go and have a pint!\". In Dublin it can be spelled \"bollix\".\n\nMultiple meanings, also spelled \"\"bolloxed\"\" or \"\"bollixed\"\":\n\nThe phrase \"bollocksed up\" means to be in a botched, bungled, confused or disarrayed state; e.g. \"He managed to bollix up the whole project.\" In the printing and newspaper industries, dropping a California Job type case of moveable type spilling the contents was a classic example of \"bollocksing up the works\". The box was called \"pied\". \"Bollocksed\" in that sense meant \"beyond all repair\".\n\n\"Dog's bollocks syndrome\" is a term used by web designers to over-designed websites that have more flash than might be needed or justified.\n\nA usage with a positive (albeit still vulgar) sense is \"\"the dog's bollocks\"\". An example of this usage is: \"Before Tony Blair's speech, a chap near me growled: 'He thinks he's the \"dog's bollocks\".' Well, he's entitled to. It was a commanding speech: a real \"dog's bollocks\" of an oration.\"\n\nAlthough this is a recent term (the \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" dates it to 1989), its origins are obscure. Etymologist Eric Partridge and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" believe the term comes from the now obsolete typographical sequence of a colon and a dash. This typography, using a dash following a colon, was used to introduce a list. Thus, it is a very early example of an emoticon.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary says the following mark (\":— \") is entitled \"the dog’s bollocks\", defined as: \"typogr. a colon followed by a dash, regarded as forming a shape resembling the male sexual organs.\" The usage is cited to the year 1949.\n\nThis phrase has found its way into popular culture in a number of ways. There is a beer brewed in England by the Wychwood Brewery called the \"\"Dog's Bollocks\"\", as well as a lager cocktail.\n\nThe phrase \"\"chuffed to one's bollocks\"\" describes someone who is very pleased with themselves. Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in \"The Homecoming\" The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in \"The Guardian\", and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying \"Oh, by the way, meant to mention, forgot to tell you, we were all \"chuffed to the bollocks\" when Labour won the election.\"\n\n\nThe rhyming slang for \"bollocks\" is \"\"Jackson Pollocks\"\". It can be shortened to \"Jacksons\", as in \"Modern art? Pile o' \"Jacksons\" if you ask me!\". \"Sandra Bullocks\" is occasionally used to approximate rhyming slang; it does not quite rhyme, but preserves meter and rhythm. The Beautiful South bowdlerised their original line \"\"sweaty bollocks\"\" as \"\"Sandra Bullocks\"\", as one of several changes to make their song \"Don't Marry Her\" acceptable for mainstream radio play.\n\nThe term \"\"Horlicks\"\" was brought to prominence in July 2003, when then-British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw used it to describe irregularities in the preparation and provenance of the \"dodgy dossier\" regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Straw used the expression \"a complete \"Horlicks\"\", instead of the more impolite \"make a complete \"bollocks\" of something\". This euphemism stems from an advertising campaign for the Horlicks malt drink, where people were seen to be shouting \"\"Horlicks!\"\" in a loud voice, to give vent to stress or frustration. Eric Morecambe was also known to cough \"\"Horlicks!\"\" behind his hand on The Morecambe and Wise Show.\n\n\"Rollocking\" is sometimes used as a euphemism for \"\"bollocking\"\". A \"rollocking bollocking\" may be delivered by an electorate.\n\nThe 2007 \"Concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English\" quotes \"bollards\" as meaning \"testicles\" and that it is a play on the word bollocks.\n\nThe play \"Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery\", published in 1684 and ascribed to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, includes a character named Bolloxinion, King of Sodom (along with other characters with names such as General Buggeranthos and the maid of honour, Fuckadilla). The word \"bollox\" appears several times in the text, such as:\n\nIn 1690, the publisher Benjamin Crayle was fined 20 pounds and sent to prison for his part in publishing the play.\n\nIn one of the tales in Burton's 1885 translation of \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night\", Kafur, the eunuch, says:\nPerhaps the best-known use of the term is in the title of the 1977 punk rock album \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\". Testimony in a resulting prosecution over the term demonstrated that in Old English, the word referred to a priest, and could also be used to mean \"nonsense\". Defence barrister John Mortimer QC and Virgin Records won the case: the court ruled that the word was not obscene. It just means \"put aside all of that other rubbish and pay attention to this\". In a summary for the defence, Mortimer asked,\n\nTony Wright, a Leicestershire trader, was given an £80 fixed penalty fine by police for selling T-shirts bearing the slogan \"Bollocks to Blair\". This took place on 29 June 2006 at the Royal Norfolk Show; the police issued the penalty notice, quoting Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 which refers to language \"deemed to cause harassment, alarm or distress\".\n\n"}

In its original usage the word \"wight\" described a living human being, but more recently, the word has been used within the fantasy genre of literature to describe certain undead. The earliest example of this usage in English is in William Morris' translation of the \"Grettis Saga\", wherein draug is translated as \"barrow-wight\". \n\n"}
{"id": "459900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459900", "title": "Paan", "text": "Paan\n\nPaan (from Sanskrit \"parṇa\" meaning \"leaf\") is a preparation combining betel leaf with areca nut widely consumed throughout Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Asia. It is chewed for its stimulant and psychoactive effects. After chewing it is either spat out or swallowed. Paan has many variations. Slaked lime (chunnam) paste is commonly added to bind the leaves. Some South Asian preparations include katha paste or mukhwas to freshen the breath.\n\nThe origin and diffusion of betel chewing originates from and is closely tied to the Neolithic expansion of the Austronesian peoples. It was spread to the Indo-Pacific during prehistoric times, reaching Near Oceania at 3,500 to 3,000 BP; South India and Sri Lanka by 3,500 BP; Mainland Southeast Asia by 3,000 to 2,500 BP; Northern India by 500 BP; and Madagascar by 600 BP. From India, it was also spread westwards to Persia and the Mediterranean.\n\nPaan (under a variety of names) is also consumed in many other Asian countries and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, with or without tobacco. It is an addictive and euphoria-inducing formulation with adverse health effects. The spit from chewing betel nuts, known as \"buai pekpek\" in Papua New Guinea, is often considered an eyesore. Because of this, many places have banned selling and chewing \"buai\".\n\nBased on archaeological, linguistic, and botanical evidence, the spread of betel chewing is most strongly associated with the Austronesian peoples. Chewing betel requires the combination of areca nut (\"Areca catechu\") and betel leaf (\"Piper betle\"). Both plants are native from the region between Island Southeast Asia to Australasia. \"A. carechu\" is believed to be originally native to the Philippines, where it has the greatest morphological diversity as well as the most number of closely related endemic species. The origin of the domestication of \"Piper betle\", however, is unknown. It is also unknown when the two were combined, as areca nut alone can be chewed for its narcotic properties. In eastern Indonesia, leaves from the wild \"Piper caducibracteum\" are also harvested and used in place of betel leaves.\n\nThere are very old claims of betel chewing dating to at least 13,000 BP at the Kuk Swamp site in New Guinea, based on probable \"Areca\" sp. recovered. However, it is now known that these might have been due to modern contamination of sample materials. Similar claims have also been made at other older sites with \"Areca\" sp. remains, but none can be conclusively identified as \"A. carechu\" and their association with betel peppers is tenuous or nonexistent.\n\nThe oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines. Specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 4,630±250 BP . The dentition of the skeletons are stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes \"Anadara\" shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millenium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term \"*buaq\" originally meaning \"fruit\" came to refer to \"areca nut\" in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~5,000 BP). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia.\nIt reached Micronesia at around 3,500 to 3,000 BP with the Austronesian voyagers, based on both linguistic and archaeological evidence. It was also previously present in the Lapita culture, based on archaeological remains from Mussau dated to around 3,600 to 2,500 BP. But it did not reach Polynesia further east. It is believed that it stopped in the Solomon Islands due to the replacement of betel chewing with the tradition of kava drinking prepared from the related \"Piper methysticum\". It was also diffused into East Africa via the Austronesian settlement of Madagascar and the Comoros by around the 7th century CE.\n\nThe practice also diffused to the cultures the Austronesians had historical contact with. It reached the Dong Son and the Sa Huỳnh cultures of Vietnam at around 3,000 to 2,500 BP through trade contacts with Borneo. It is from this period that skeletons with characteristic red-stained teeth start to appear in Mainland Southeast Asia. It is assumed that it reached South China and Hainan at around the same time, though no archaeological evidence for this can be found as of yet. In Cambodia, the earliest evidence of betel nut chewing is from around 2,400 to 2,200 BP. It also spread to Thailand at 1,500 BP, based on archaeobotanical evidence.\n\nChinese records, specifically \"Linyi Ji\" by Dongfang Shuo associate the growing of areca palms with the first settlers of the Austronesian Champa polities in southern Vietnam at around 2,100 to 1,900 BP. This association is echoed in \"Nanfang Cao Mu Zhuang\" by Ji Han (c. 304 CE) who also describes its importance in Champa culture, specifically in the way Cham hosts traditionally offer it to guests. Betel chewing entered China through trade with Champa, borrowing the Proto-Malayo-Chamic name \"*pinaŋ\" resulting in Chinese \"bin lang\" for \"areca nut\", with the meaning of \"honored guest\", reflecting Chamic traditions. The same for the alternate term \"bin men yao jian\", literally meaning \"guest [at the door] medicinal sweetmeat\".\n\nIn South Asia, betel chewing was introduced through early contact of Austronesian traders from Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula with the Dravidian-speakers of Sri Lanka and southern India at around 3,500 BP. This also coincides with the introduction of Southeast Asian plants like \"Santalum album\" and \"Cocos nucifera\", as well as the adoption of the Austronesian outrigger ship and crab-claw sail technologies by Dravidian-speakers. Unequivocal literary references to betel only start appearing after the Vedic period, in works like \"Dipavaṃsa\" (c. 3rd century CE) and \"Mahāvaṃsa\" (c. 5th century CE). Betel chewing only reached northern India and Kashmir after 500 CE through trade with Mon-Khmer-speaking peoples in the Bay of Bengal. From there it followed the Silk Road to Persia and into the Mediterranean.\n\nChewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf is a tradition, custom or ritual which dates back thousands of years from India to the Pacific. Ibn Battuta describes this practice as follows:\n\"The betel is a tree which is cultivated in the same manner as the grape-vine; ... The betel has no fruit and is grown only for the sake of its leaves ... The manner of its use is that before eating it one takes areca nut; this is like a nutmeg but is broken up until it is reduced to small pellets, and one places these in his mouth and chews them. Then he takes the leaves of betel, puts a little chalk on them, and masticates them along with the betel.\" Since the introduction of tobacco from the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern Hemisphere, it has been an optional addition to paan.\n\nPaan chewing constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many Asian and Oceanic countries, including India, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, and Vietnam.\n\nPaan is a ubiquitous sight in many parts of South and Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, it is known as mama or maman in Ilokano, sirih in Indonesian, suruh in Javanese, mark (ໝາກ) in Lao, sireh in Malay language, ngangà in Tagalog, and buai in Tok Pisin. In South Asia it is known as paan in Assamese, foah in Dhivehi, beeda in Hindi, \"veelya\" or \"taamboola\" or \"yele adike\" in Kannada, vetrrilai or thambulam in Tamil, killi and tambulum in Telugu, bulath in Sinhalese, \"faan\" in Sylheti and gillauri in Urdu.\n\nIn urban areas, chewing paan is generally considered a nuisance because some chewers spit the paan out in public areas – compare chewing gum ban in Singapore and smoking ban. The red stain generated by the combination of ingredients when chewed are known to make a colourful stain on the ground. This is becoming an unwanted eyesore in Indian cities such as Mumbai, although many see it as an integral part of Indian culture. This is also common in some of the Persian Gulf countries, such as the UAE and Qatar, where many Indians live. Recently, the Dubai government has banned the import and sale of paan and the like.\n\nAccording to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing betel leaf is a remedy against bad breath (halitosis), but it can possibly lead to oral cancer.\n\nIn a 16th-century cookbook, \"Nimmatnama-i Nasiruddin-Shahi\", describes Ghiyas-ud-din Khalji, the Sultan of Mandu (r. 1469–1500), watches as tender betel leaves of the finest quality are spread out and rosewater is sprinkled on them, while saffron is also added. An elaborate betel chew or paan would contain fragrant spices and rose preserves with chopped areca nuts.\n\nIt is a tradition in South India and nearby regions to give two Betel leaves, areca nut (pieces or whole) and Coconut to the guests (both male and female) at any auspicious occasion. Even on a regular day it is the tradition to give a married woman, who visits the house, two Betel leaves, areca nut and coconut or some fruits along with a string of threaded flowers. This is referred to as \"tambolam\".\n\nBetel leaf used to make paan is produced in different parts of India. Some states that produce betel leaf for paan include West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal two types of betel leaves are produced. These are \"Bangla Pata (Country Leaf)\" and Mitha Pata (Sweet Leaf)\". In West Bengal, \"Bangla pata\" is produced mainly in district of Dinajpur, Malda, Jalpaiguri, and Nadia. \"Mitha pata\" is produced in places such as Midnapur and South 24 Parganas.\n\nThe skilled paan maker is known as a \"paanwala\" in North India. In other parts, \"paanwalas\" are also known as \"panwaris\" or \"panwadis\". At North India, there is a tradition to chew paan after Deepawali puja for blessings.\n\nFurthermore, the use of paan is also prevalent in the Punjab. So much so that shops selling paan legally have sprung up in western cities such as Toronto, London, and Vancouver to name a few due to the large number of people of Punjabi descent living in those regions.\n\nIn the Indian state of Maharashtra the paan culture is widely criticised due to the cleanliness problems created by people who spit in public places. In Mumbai, there have been attempts to put pictures of Hindu gods in places where people commonly tend to spit, in the hope that this would discourage spitting, but success has been limited. One of the great Marathi artists P L Deshpande wrote a comic story on the subject of \"paanwala\" (paan vendor), and performed a televised reading session on Doordarshan during the 1980s in his unique style.\n\nPaan is losing its appeal to farmers because of falling demand. Consumers prefer chewing tobacco formulations such as gutka over paan. Higher costs, water scarcity and unpredictable weather have made betel gardens less lucrative.\n\n1. Auspicious: In Assam, betel nut are traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. It is a tradition to offer pan-tamul (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests, after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called bota. Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol. When showing respect to elders, people, especially newly weds place a pair of paan Tamul on a xorai, places it in front of the elder ( a plate like utensil with a stand) and bows in front of it to show respect or while asking for forgiveness.\n\n2. Invitation : A tradition from Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the husori players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.\n\n3. Refreshment: A customary Paan-Tamul (Betel nut leaf- Betel nut) is offered to guests after the end of every Bhoj[feast]. This is usually the Paan-Tamul-Soon (Slacked lime) with cardamom pods in it to freshen the breath.\n\n\"Bersirih\", \"nyirih\" or menginang is a Malay-Indonesian tradition of chewing materials such as nut, betel, gambier, tobacco, clove and limestone. \"Menginang\" tradition or chewing betel nut is widespread among Indonesian ethnic groups, especially among the Javanese, Balinese and Malay people; dating back to more than 3000 years. Records of travelers from China showed that betel and areca had been consumed since the 2nd century BCE.\n\nIn the Malay archipelago, the \"menginang\" or betel nut chewing has become a revered activity in local tradition; being a ceremoniously conducted gesture to honour guests. A complete and elaborate set of \"sirih pinang\" equipment is called \"Tepak Sirih\", \"pekinangan\" or \"cerana\". The set is usually made of wooden lacquerware, brass or silverwares; and it consists of the \"combol\" (containers), \"bekas sirih\" (leaf container), \"kacip\" (press-knife to cut areca nut), \"gobek\" (small pestle and mortar), and \"ketur\" (spit container).\n\nThe \"Sirih Pinang\" has become a symbol of Malay culture, with the Malay oral tradition having phrases such as \"The betel opens the door to the home\" or \"the betel opens the door to the heart\". Menginang is used at many formal occasions such as marriages, births, deaths, and healings. A number of Malay traditional dances—such as the South Sumatran Tanggai dance—are in fact describing the dancers bringing \"cerana\" or \"tepak sirih\" equipment, ceremoniously presenting an offering of betel nut to the revered guest.\n\nPaan has been part of the indigenous culture in the Philippines. It is commonly and simply referred to as \"ngangà\" in Tagalog and \"mama\" or \"maman\" in Ilokano. \"Ngangà\" literally means \"to chew/gnaw\". Nowadays, it is mostly popular among the inhabitants of the Cordilleras, among the Lumads of Mindanao, and among lowland barrio folks elsewhere in the Philippines.\n\n\"Kwun-ya\" ( [kóːn.jà]) is the word for paan in Myanmar, formerly Burma, where the most common configuration for chewing is a betel vine leaf (\"Piper betel\"), areca nut (from \"Areca catechu\"), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and some aroma, although many betel chewers also use tobacco.\n\nBetel chewing has very long tradition in Burma, having been practised since before the beginning of recorded history. Until the 1960s, both men and women loved it and every household used to have a special lacquerware box for paan, called \"kun-it\" (), which would be offered to any visitor together with cheroots to smoke and green tea to drink. The leaves are kept inside the bottom of the box, which looks like a small hat box, but with a top tray for small tins, silver in well-to-do homes, of various other ingredients such as the betel nuts, slaked lime, cutch, anise seed and a nut cutter. The sweet form (\"acho\") is popular with the young, but grownups tend to prefer it with cardamom, cloves and tobacco. Spittoons, therefore, are still ubiquitous, and signs saying \"No paan-spitting\" are commonplace, as it makes a messy red splodge on floors and walls; many people display betel-stained teeth from the habit. Paan stalls and kiosks used to be run mainly by people of Indian origin in towns and cities. Smokers who want to kick the habit would also use betel nut to wean themselves off tobacco.\n\nTaungoo in Lower Burma is where the best areca palms are grown indicated by the popular expression \"like a betel lover taken to Taungoo\". Other parts of the country contribute to the best paan according to another saying \"Tada-U for the leaves, Ngamyagyi for the tobacco, Taungoo for the nuts, Sagaing for the slaked lime, Pyay for the cutch\". \"Kun, hsay, lahpet\" (paan, tobacco and pickled tea) are deemed essential items to offer monks and elders particularly in the old days. Young maidens traditionally carry ornamental betel boxes on a stand called \"kundaung\" and gilded flowers (\"pandaung\") in a \"shinbyu\" (novitiation) procession. Burmese history also mentions an ancient custom of a condemned enemy asking for \"a paan and a drink of water\" before being executed.\n\nAn anecdotal government survey indicated that 40% of men and 20% of women in Myanmar chew betel. An aggregate study of cancer registries (2002 to 2007) at the Yangon and Mandalay General Hospitals, the largest hospitals in the country, found that oral cancer was the 6th most common cancer among males, and 10th among females. Of these oral carcinoma patients, 36% were regular betel quid chewers. University of Dental Medicine, Yangon records from 1985 to 1988 showed that 58.6% of oral carcinoma patients were regular betel chewers.\n\nSince the 1990s, betel chewing has been actively discouraged by successive governments, from the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) onward, on the grounds of health and tidiness. In April 1995, the Yangon City Development Committee banned betel in Yangon (Rangoon), in anticipation of Visit Myanmar Year 1996, a massive effort to promote the country as a tourist destination. Effective 29 July 2007, betel chewing, along with smoking, has been banned from the Shwedagon Pagoda, the country's most important religious site. In 2010, the Ministry of Education's Department of Basic Education and Burma's Anti-Narcotics Task Force collaborated to prohibit betel shops from operating within of any school.\n\nThe consumption of paan has long been a very popular cultural tradition throughout Pakistan, especially in Muhajir households, where numerous paans were consumed throughout the day. In general, though, paan is an occasional delicacy thoroughly enjoyed by many, and almost exclusively bought from street vendors instead of any preparations at home. Pakistan grows a large variety of betel leaf, specifically in the coastal areas of Sindh, although paan is imported in large quantities from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and, recently, Thailand. The paan business is famously handled and run by muhajir traders, who migrated from western India to Pakistan after the independence in 1947 (also cite pg 60, of Pakistan, By Samuel Willard Crompton, Charles F. Gritzner).\n\nThe culture of chewing \"paan\" has also spread in Punjab where a \"paan\" shop can be found in almost every street and market. In the famous \"Anarkali Bazar\" in Lahore a street called \"paan gali\" is dedicated for \"paan\" and its ingredients together with other Pakistani products.\n\nThe rate of Oral cancer have grown substantially in Pakistan due to chewing of Paan.\n\nThe chewing of the product is part of the culture of Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. Cultivation of areca nut palm and betel leaves is common in rural areas of these countries, being a traditional cash crop, and the utensils used for preparation are often treasured. Now, many young people have given up the habit, especially in urban areas, but many, especially older people, still keep to the tradition.\n\nIn Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase \"matters of betel and areca\" (\"chuyện trầu cau\") is synonymous with marriage. Areca nut chewing starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings.\n\nIn Bangladesh, \"paan\" is chewed throughout the country by all classes and is an important element of Bangladeshi culture. It is the Bengali ‘chewing gum’, and usually for chewing, a few slices of the betel nut are wrapped in a betel leaf, almost always with sliced areca nuts and often with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), and may include cinnamon, clove, cardamom, catechu (khoyer), grated coconut and other spices for extra flavouring. As it is chewed, the peppery taste is savoured, along with the warm feeling and alertness it gives (similar to drinking a fresh cup of coffee). Paan-shupari (shupari being Bengali for areca nut) is a veritable Bangladeshi archetypal imagery, employed in wide-ranging contexts. Prior to British rule, it was chewed without tobacco and it is still rarely chewed with tobacco. Betel leaves are arranged aesthetically on a decorated plate called paandani and it is offered to the elderly people, particularly women, when they engage in leisure time gossip with their friends and relatives. During the zamindari age, paan preparation and the style of garnishing it on a plate (paandani) was indeed a recognised folk art.\n\nIn Bangladesh paan is traditionally chewed not only as a habit but also as an item of rituals, etiquette and manners. On formal occasions offering paan symbolized the time for departure. In festivals and dinners, in pujas and punyas paan is an indispensable item. Hindus make use of paans as offerings in worship.\n\nDhakai Khilipan, a ready pack of betel leaf processed in Dhaka is famous in the sub-continent. Old Dhakaites have a rich heritage of creating the best khili paan with many complex, colourful, aromatic and mouth-watering ingredients. Although 'paan' has been a staple Bengali custom for ages, a number of high-end stores with premium quality paan has become available in recent times.Paan Supari is perhaps the first such brand, which offers a wide range of khili paan. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the \"paan afsana\".\n\nThe sweet paan of the Khasi tribe is famous for its special quality. Paan is also used in Hindu puja and wedding festivals and to visit relatives. It has become a ritual, tradition and culture of Bangladeshi society. Adult women gather with paandani along with friends and relatives in leisure time.\n\nTotal cultivated area under the crop in Bangladesh is about 14,175 ha and the total annual production is about 72,500 tons. The average yield per acre is 2.27 tons. There are usually three crops during the twelve months and they are locally called by the name of the respective months in which they are harvested. Paan leaf is usually plucked in Kartik, Phalgun and Ashad. The Kartik paan is considered by consumers to be the best and Ashad paan the worst. When plucking, it is a rule to leave at least sixteen leaves on the vine.\n\nDifferent varieties of betel leaf are grown and the quality differs in shape, bleaching quality, softness, pungency and aroma of leaf. Tamakh paan, a betel leaf bended with tobacco and spices. Supari paan, another variety of white leaf, Mitha paan, a sweet variety, and Sanchi paan are common varieties of betel leaves. Almost every paan-producing district has its own special variety of betel leaf of which consumers are well acquainted. In the past, the best quality of elegant camphor-scented betel leaf named Kafuri paan was produced in the sonargaon area of Narayangonj district. It was exported to Calcutta and Middle Eastern countries. The next best is the Sanchi paan grown in Chittagong hill tracts. This variety is not very popular among Bangali people. It is exported to Pakistan for the consumers of Karachi. The commoner varieties are called Desi, Bangla, Bhatial, Dhaldoga, Ghas paan. Bangla paan, is also known as Mitha paan, Jhal paan or paan of Rajshahi. At present, this variety is becoming extinct, due to emergence of more profitable and lucrative fast-growing varieties of paan crops. Normally, betel leaves are consumed with chun, seed cinnamon, cardamoms and other flavored elements.\n\nPaan is chewed mainly by Madheshis, although migrants in Terai have also taken up chewing paan in recent times. Throughout Terai, paan is as common as anywhere in northern India. There is some local production, generally not commercial, but most leaves are imported from India. Although not as ubiquitous as in the Terai, most residents of Kathmandu occasionally enjoy paan. A sweet version of paan called \"meetha paan\" is popular amongst many who do not like the strong taste of plain (\"sada\") paan. Some parents allow their children to consume meetha in special occasion because it is tobacco-free.\n\nIn Taiwan betel quid is sold from roadside kiosks, often by the so-called betelnut beauties (Hokkien \"pin-nn̂g se-si\", Mandarin \"bīnláng xīshī\", 檳榔西施)—scantily-clad girls selling a quid preparation of betel leaf, betel nuts, tobacco and lime. It is a controversial business, with critics questioning entrapment, exploitation, health, class and culture.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) accept the scientific evidence that chewing betel quids and areca nut is carcinogenic to humans. The main carcinogenic factor is believed to be areca nut. A recent study found that areca-nut paan with and without tobacco increased oral cancer risk by 9.9 and 8.4 times, respectively.\n\nIn one study (c. 1985), scientists linked malignant tumours to the site of skin or subcutaneous administration of aqueous extracts of \"paan\" in mice. In hamsters, forestomach carcinomas occurred after painting the cheek-pouch mucosa with aqueous extracts or implantation of a wax pellet containing powdered \"paan\" with tobacco into the cheek pouch; carcinomas occurred in the cheek pouch following implantation of the wax pellets. In human populations, they reported observing elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells in buccal mucosa of people who chew betel quid in the Philippines and India. The scientists also found that the proportion of micronucleated exfoliated cells is related to the site within the oral cavity where the \"paan\" is kept habitually and to the number of betel quids chewed per day. In related studies, the scientists reported that oral leukoplakia shows a strong association with habits of \"paan\" chewing in India. Some follow-up studies have shown malignant transformation of a proportion of leukoplakias. Oral submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, which are generally accepted to be precancerous conditions, appear to be related to the habit of chewing \"paan\".\n\nIn a study conducted in Taiwan, scientists reported the extent of cancer risks of betel quid (\"paan\") chewing beyond oral cancer, even when tobacco was absent. In addition to oral cancer, significant increases were seen among chewers for cancer of the oesophagus, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, and all cancer. Chewing and smoking, as combined by most betel chewers, interacted synergistically and was responsible for half of all cancer deaths in this group. Chewing betel leaf quid and smoking, the scientists claimed, shortened the life span by nearly six years.\n\nA \"Lancet Oncology\" publication claims that \"paan masala\" may cause tumours in different parts of the body and not just the oral cavity as previously thought.\n\nIn a study conducted in Sri Lanka, scientists found high prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders in rural Sri Lankan populations. After screening for various causes, the scientists reported \"paan\" chewing to be the major risk factor, with or without tobacco.\n\nIn October 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including areca nut, a common additive in \"paan\". They reported there is sufficient evidence that \"paan\" chewing, even without tobacco, leads to tumours in the oral cavity and oesophagus, and that \"paan\" with added tobacco is a carcinogen to the oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus.\n\nScientific teams from Taiwan, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea have reported that women who chew areca nut formulations, such as \"paan\", during pregnancy significantly increase adverse outcomes for the baby. The effects were similar to those reported for women who consume alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy. Lower birth weights, reduced birth length and early term were found to be significantly higher.\n\n\n"}

After cutting the word out of the instruction sheet, he made copies and used rubber cement to paste \"Potrzebie\" randomly into the middle of \"Mad\" satires.\n\n\"Potrzebie\" was first used in a story in \"Mad\" 11 (May 1954), where it was the exclamation of a character who spoke only in foreign languages and song lyrics, in \"Murder the Story,\" a parody illustrated by Jack Davis. It was used again in Bernard Krigstein's \"From Eternity Back to Here!\" in \"Mad\" 12 (June 1954) on an airplane advertising banner. With the same type font, it reappeared in Jack Davis's \"Book! Movie!\" in \"Mad\" 13 (July 1954), pasted into a panel as the title of an abstract painting seen in the background. In the same issue the word appears as POTS-REBIE, emblazoned on a cauldron in which Robinson Crusoe is roasting a frankfurter. This piece reappeared in one of the earliest \"Mad\" paperbacks, \"Bedside Mad\" It was illustrated as a rebus in \"Puzzle Pages!\" in \"Mad\" 19 (January 1955). These stories, like others in \"Mad\" comics, were written by Harvey Kurtzman. Frequent repetition gave it the status of a catch phrase or in-joke among the readership which continues to the present day. In the first \"Mad Style Guide\", edited by Bhob Stewart in 1994, the word was made available for display on T-shirts and other licensed \"Mad\" products. It also sees occasional use as a metasyntactic variable by hackers.\nA typical appearance of the word is exemplified by the \"Mad\" version of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (from \"Mad\" 43, December 1958), which begins:\n\nIn issue 33, \"Mad\" published a partial table of the \"Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures\", developed by 19-year-old Donald E. Knuth, later a famed computer scientist. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of \"Mad\" issue 26, or 2.2633484517438173216473 mm, although a digit was mistakenly dropped and the thickness appeared as 2.263348517438173216473 mm in the MAD article. A standardization in terms of the wavelength of the red line of the emission spectrum of cadmium is also given, which if the 1927 definition of the Ångstrom is taken for the value of that wavelength, would equal 2.263347539605392 mm.\n\nVolume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in blintz (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of halavah, which is \"a form of pie [with] a specific gravity of 3.1416 and a specific heat of .31416\"), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average earth rotation, equal to 1 \"clarke\"). The system also features such units as \"whatmeworry\", \"cowznofski\", \"vreeble\", \"hoo\" and \"hah\".\n\nAccording to the \"Date\" system in Knuth's article, which substitutes a 10-clarke \"mingo\" for a month and a 100-clarke \"cowznofski\", for a year, the date of October 29, 2007, was originally rendered as \"Cal 7, 201 C.M.\" (for Cowznofsko Madi, or \"in the Cowznofski of our MAD\"). The dates are calculated from October 1, 1952, the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as \"B.M.\" (\"Before MAD.\") Later Knuth preferred 0-origin indexing, so October 29, 2007 is now rendered as \"Cal 6, 201 C.M.\". The ten \"Mingoes\" are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)\n\nGoogle's calculator can perform conversions from potrzebie system to other units.\n\nThe word made an impression on many readers, for example jazz guitarist Jimmy Raney, who recorded the tune \"Potrezebie\" on the album \"The Dual Role of Bob Brookmeyer\" (1954; reissued on compact disc in 1992). In the late 1960s, \"Potrzebie\" was a \"Jeopardy\" category.\n\n\"Potrzebie\" became the default password for the #1 (which is \"God\" or the root account) user account in several MUSHes and MUCKs (e.g., PennMUSH, TinyMUCK, Fuzzball MUCK, TinyMUSH, and TinyMUX).\n\nOther odd words favored by Kurtzman and popularized by him through their use as running gags in \"Mad\" were \"veeblefetzer\", \"axolotl\", \"hoohah\", \"osszefogva\", \"bitsko\", \"furshlugginer\", \"Moxie\", \"ganef\" and \"halavah\". Many of these are of Yiddish or Jewish origin.\n\nIn the Bill Griffith comic strip \"Zippy\" for February 27, 2007, Zippy and Zerbina mention both \"potrzebie\" and \"axolotl\" in a panel captioned, \"They like to use out-of-date words and catchphrases.\" The word was also featured as the title of the May 30, 2018 strip and again on September 8, 2018 and January 5, 2019.\n\nIn \"Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess,\" the second of the novelizations of Phil and Kaja Foglio's \"Girl Genius\" webcomic, the character Herr Doktor Potrezbie Spün is one of the many footnoted references.\n\n"}

In modern use, it is used as a slang term, especially in Yorkshire, for a gossipy or overly talkative person.\n\nIts origin may lie in a meaningless representation of chattering.\n\nThis word also has a historical use as a name for a fiend, devil, or spirit. In the 15th-century English morality play \"The Castle of Perseverance\", the Bad Angel addresses the vice figure Detraccio (also called Backbiter and the messenger of the World) as \"Flyprgebet\" (line 1724). In Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" (IV, i (1605)), he is one of the five fiends that Edgar claimed was possessing him, this one in the posture of beggar Tom o' Bedlam. Shakespeare got the name from Samuel Harsnett's \"Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures\" (1603), where one reads of 40 fiends which Jesuits cast out and among which was Fliberdigibbet, described as one of \"foure deuils of the round, or Morrice, whom \"Sara\" in her fits, tuned together, in measure and sweet ucadence.\"\n\nIt has been used by extension as a synonym for Puck. It is also used as a nickname for a character in Sir Walter Scott's \"Kenilworth\", and has gained the meaning of an impish child.\n\nThe term is also used in Kurt Vonnegut's popular novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", which references the protagonists' daughter as a \"bitchy flibbertigibbit\". \n\nFlibbertigibbet similarly is featured as a name in a local legend about Wayland's Smithy. According to the tale, Flibbertigibbet was apprentice to Wayland the Smith and greatly exasperated his master. Eventually, Wayland threw Flibbertigibbet down the hill and into a valley, where he was transformed into a stone. Scott associates his Flibbertigibbet character in \"Kenilworth\" with Wayland Smith.\n\nIn \"The Sound of Music\", in the song \"Maria\", one of the nuns responds to the question \"How do you find a word that means Maria?\" with \"Flibbertigibbet.\"\n\nThis term was also used in the \"Looney Tunes\" episode \"Tweety's S.O.S.\" by Granny when she drops her glasses.\n\nIn the 1935 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of Charles Dickens novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\", Miss Pross (Edna May Oliver) sternly informs Sydney Carton (Ronald Colman) that she is not a flibbertigibbet.\n\nIn the 1990 American romantic comedy film \"Joe Versus the Volcano\", Meg Ryan's character Angelica refers to herself as a flibbertigibbet.\n\nIn 2018 British Author Chris Redmile released a children's book named The Flibber-ti-gibbet, a read in rhyme book designed to educate children about the traits of ADHD.\n\n7.

{"id": "462173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462173", "title": "Fettuccine Alfredo", "text": "Fettuccine Alfredo\n\nFettuccine Alfredo () or fettuccine al burro is a pasta dish made from fettuccine tossed with Parmesan cheese and butter. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich sauce coating the pasta. In other words, it is a version of pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese (). Alfredo di Lelio gave it this name at his restaurants in Rome, in the early to mid 20th century, where the \"ceremony\" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.\n\nThe dish became popularized and eventually spread to the United States. The recipe has evolved and its commercialized version is now ubiquitous with heavy cream and other ingredients. In the US, it is often garnished with chicken or other ingredients to make it into a main course. In Italy, \"fettuccine al burro\" is generally considered home cooking; fettuccine Alfredo is a very rich version.\n\nServing fettuccine with butter and cheese was first mentioned in a 15th-century recipe for \"maccaroni romaneschi\" 'Roman pasta' by Martino da Como, a northern Italian cook active in Rome; the recipe cooks the noodles in broth or water and adds butter, \"good cheese\" (the variety is not specified) and \"sweet spices\".\n\nModern \"fettuccine Alfredo\" was invented by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome. According to family accounts, in 1892 Alfredo di Lelio began to work in a restaurant that was located in piazza Rosa and run by his mother Angelina. Di Lelio invented \"fettuccine al triplo burro\" (later named \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" or \"fettuccine Alfredo\") in 1907 or 1908 in an effort to entice his wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Alfredo added extra butter or \"triplo burro” to the fettuccine when mixing it together for her. Piazza Rosa disappeared in 1910 following the construction of the Galleria Colonna/Sordi and the restaurant was forced to close. Di Lelio later opened his own restaurant, Alfredo alla Scrofa then called \"Alfredo\", in 1914 on the via della Scrofa in central Rome.\n\nThe fame of Alfredo's fettuccine spread, first in Rome and then to other countries. Di Lelio was made a Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia.\n\nIn 1943, during the war, di Lelio sold the restaurant to two of his waiters. In 1950, with his son Armando, Alfredo di Lelio opened a new restaurant in piazza Augusto Imperatore, Alfredo all'Augusteo, now managed by his niece Ines Di Lelio, bringing along the famous \"gold cutlery\" said to have been donated in 1927 by the American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (in gratitude for Alfredo’s hospitality). The two restaurants competed vigorously, with escalating puffery: \"the king of fettuccine\", \"the real king of fettuccine\", \"the magician of fettuccine\", \"the emperor of fettuccine\", \"the real Alfredo\", etc.\n\nThe dish was so well known that di Lelio was invited to demonstrate it both in Italy and abroad. The fame of the dish, called on Alfredo's menus \"maestosissime fettuccine all'Alfredo\" 'most majestic fettuccine, Alfredo style', comes largely from the \"spectacle reminiscent of grand opera\" of its preparation at table, as described in 1967:\n\n[The fettuccine] are seasoned with plenty of butter and fat parmesan, not aged, so that, in a ritual of extraordinary theatricality, the owner mixes the pasta and lifts it high to serve it, the white threads of cheese gilded with butter and the bright yellow of the ribbons of egg pasta offering an eyeful for the customer; at the end of the ceremony, the guest of honor is presented the golden cutlery and the serving dish, where the blond fettuccine roll around in the pale gold of the seasonings. It's worth seeing the whole ceremony. The owner, son of old Alfredo and looking exactly like him, ... bends over the great skein of fettuccine, fixes it intensely, his eyes half-closed, and dives into mixing it, waving the golden cutlery with grand gestures, like an orchestra conductor, with his sinister upwards-pointing twirled moustache dancing up and down, pinkies in the air, a rapt gaze, flailing elbows.\nRecipes attributed to Alfredo only include three ingredients: fettuccine, young Parmesan cheese and butter. Yet there are various legends about the \"secret\" of the original Alfredo recipe: some say oil is added to the pasta dough, others that the noodles are cooked in milk. The secret may in fact be simply that the noodles, cheese and butter are tossed constantly with some pasta water in a well-warmed platter to ensure that they melt together thoroughly.\n\nFettuccine Alfredo, minus the spectacle, has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants outside Italy, although in Italy this dish is usually called simply \"fettuccine al burro\".\n\nAlfredo's fettuccine has long been popular with Americans. By 1922, it was already being reported on by American travelers. Multiple magazine articles and guidebooks in the 1920s and 1930s extolled Alfredo's noodles. In 1927, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks supposedly dined at Alfredo's and gave him the famous gold fork and spoon. Also in 1927, the American restaurateur and writer George Rector wrote up Alfredo's fettuccine and described the ceremony of its tableside preparation, accompanied by violin music, in detail; he did not give it a specific name, nor mention golden tableware.\n\nIn 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started marketing their \"Fettuccine Egg Noodles\", which included a recipe on the package for an Alfredo sauce including cream and Swiss cheese as well as Parmesan and butter.\n\nAlfredo sauce is often sold as a convenience food in grocery stores in many countries. Unlike the original preparation, which is thickened only by cheese, the prepared food and fast food versions may be thickened with eggs or starch. The base of all authentic homemade Alfredo sauce is dairy and it includes the following 3 main ingredients; heavy cream, butter, and parmesan cheese.\n\n"}

Osborne set out to make a product more palatable than \"Granose\", a biscuit that was marketed by the Sanitarium Health Food Company at that time. On 19 August 1926, he lodged an application for registration of the trademark Weetbix, a name which he had devised. Initially, the product was labelled as 'The Health Biscuit' by the company. \n\nProduction began at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt, under the management of Osborne and with the financial backing of Arthur Shannon who created the company \"Grain Products\" to manufacture the cereal. Osborne's friend Malcolm Ian Macfarlane from New Zealand joined him to take on a marketing role. The product was so successful that in October 1928, Shannon sold the rights in the product to the Australasian Conference Association Limited (Sanitarium Health Food Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and venture of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia). Macfarlane suggested that they ship the product to New Zealand, where it proved so successful that it became difficult to adequately supply the market from Australia. Osborne and MacFarlane went to New Zealand and factories were established in Auckland and Christchurch. However, once again, Shannon sold out to the Australasian Conference Association Limited. \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane then exported the product to South Africa and with Shannon's financial backing, went to that country and a factory was built in Cape Town, with Osborne managing sales. This enterprise was also subsequently sold, this time to Bokomo.\nWhile in South Africa, Osborne and Macfarlane sought to obtain more satisfactory financial backing to secure Osborne's product. A group was formed, Osborne refined the product and he and Macfarlane went to England to form the British & African Cereal Company, Ltd., which they registered in London in 1932, as a Private Company, with the proprietor shown as Weetabix Limited of Weetabix Mills, Burton Latimer, Kettering. All shares in the Company were specified to be under the control of the Directors, the first of whom were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton. For the purpose of differentiating the product from that sold in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the product was named \"Weetabix\". \n\nOsborne and Macfarlane became the joint managing directors with Osborne controlling production and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with Burton Latimer in Northamptonshire eventually being chosen, due in part to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the Company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the Company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the Company was renamed \"Weetabix Limited\". \n\nOsborne proceeded at that time to the United States, establishing a weetabix factory in Clinton, Massachusetts. However, the venture was unsuccessful. Weetabix eventually entered the US market from Canada via Clinton, Massachusetts, the site of the original US factory.\n\nIn July 2014 Sanitarium introduced Gluten Free Weet Bix, produced from sorghum grains. Earlier in 2014, the company had recommissioned their Perth-based Weet-Bix factory into a dedicated gluten free manufacturing facility to produce this new product.\n\nWeet-Bix is seen in both Australia and New Zealand as an iconic national foodstuff. An online poll of 16,000 people in 2006 identified it as Australia's favourite trademark. The product has been marketed in Australia since 1985 with the catchphrase \"Aussie Kids are Weet-Bix kids\". Based on its success in Australia, a similar catchphrase was adopted six months later in New Zealand: \"Kiwi Kids are Weet-Bix kids\". \nWeet-Bix sponsors the Australian cricket team and the New Zealand rugby union team, members of whom have appeared in some television advertising campaigns. It is also the main sponsor for the Sanitarium Weet-Bix Kids Tryathlon events in both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, soccer player Tim Cahill and surfer Stephanie Gilmore are the brand’s main ambassadors.\n\nSanitarium started to issue collectors' cards in 1942 as a marketing device in their boxes of Weet-Bix and some of their other breakfast cereal products including Granose, Bixies, Cerix and later Puffed Wheat, Puffed Rice, Weeta Puffs, Weeta Flakes and Corn Flakes. Sanitarium have also issued cards in their New Zealand products, sometimes similar to the Australian series but also series with a New Zealand focus.\n\n\n"}

It was launched in the United States in 1914, and has had variable market share since then.\n\nAs a play on the word \"double\" in the name, one of the most notable aspects of this brand is the advertising campaign featuring identical twins. Beginning in 1939 with stylized illustrations of twins, advertisements continued with print ads and later television commercials, featuring actual twins as spokespersons. From 1959, the original \"Doublemint Twins\" were 21-year-old Jayne and Joan Knoerzer (professionally using their mother's maiden name, Boyd) of Hammond, Indiana, appeared in advertisements for Doublemint, until 1963 when Joan became pregnant. The company, however, continued sporadically to promote the campaign, which included twins Jennie and Terrie Frankel in the late 1960s; later \"Doublemint Twins\" included June and Patricia Mackrell through the 1970s (who had also been the Toni Twins for Toni Home Permanent, which used the slogan \"Which twin has the Toni?\"), Patricia and Cybil (some sources show her name as Priscilla) Barnstable, Denise and Dian Gallup, Cynthia and Brittany Daniel (future co-stars as the Wakefield twins in the TV series based on the \"Sweet Valley High\" novels), Tia and Tamera Mowry (future co-star of \"The Game\" with both Tia Mowry and Brittany Daniel and future co-stars of \"Sister, Sister\"), Heidi and Alissa Kramer, figure skaters Pamela and Jeremy Green, and Jean (née Barbara) and Elizabeth Sagal (daughters of TV director Boris Sagal and sisters of \"Married...With Children's\" Katey Sagal). The Sagal twins enjoyed a brief run as the stars of a sitcom, \"Double Trouble,\" in 1984. Later twins projected more sex appeal in keeping with trends in American advertising; the Barnstable twins were later asked to pose for\" Playboy\" due to their popularity as spokeswomen for the gum. In 1987, Denise and Dian Gallup spoofed their roles as the Doublemint Twins in cameo roles in the Mel Brooks film, \"Spaceballs.\"\n\nIn 2004, the European Union Court of Justice ultimately denied Wrigley's request for trademark status on the name \"Doublemint\"; the Court found that the mark DOUBLEMINT was descriptive of the product and in violation of trademark law.\n\nThe actual flavorings used in Doublemint gum are a trade secret, but the company does say that the main flavor ingredient is peppermint. Although it is not a sugarless gum, in 2003 Wrigley's replaced some of the sugar with artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium.\nSugar, gum base, dextrose, corn syrup, natural and artificial flavors; less than 2% of glycerol, aspartame, gum arabic, soy lecithin, acesulfame K, color (titanium dioxide, blue 1 lake, beta-carotene), BHT\n\nWrigley began running Doublemint Twin commercials again in 2005 with a new set of twins, Natalie and Nicole Garza, who were dressed in old-fashioned clothes. They drove a tandem bike through various modern day situations, singing about the complexity of modern life and touting the joy of the simple pleasure of Doublemint gum.\n\nWrigley also began an open casting call for people to be in their ad campaigns. The call goes out to not only actual twins but also, literally, anyone and their dog. Many twins have applied, but so have people and their friends, their pets, even inanimate objects. These can be seen at the official Doublemint Gum website. Since then, the Wrigley Company has run various commercials with some of the new twins, as well as Natalie and Nicole from the 2005 campaign.\n\nR&B singer Chris Brown performed a modified version of \"Forever\" in a 2008 commercial for Doublemint, which introduced a thinner Plen-T-Pack package.\n"}

There are four variations of Desserts: Orange Creme Pop, Strawberry Shortcake, Lemon Square and Apple Pie.\nJuicy Fruit also has released \"Juicy Secret\" and \"Juicy Riddle\" which are both sugar free. Beginning in 2015, Juicy Fruit released two new flavors based on Starburst candy: Strawberry and Cherry. In December 2017, Juicy Fruit introduced Juicy Fruit Mixies which include their Original flavor along with three new flavors: Strawberry, Watermelon and Grape.\n\nJuicy Fruit gum consists mostly of sugar contained in a synthetic gum base. Other ingredients include corn syrup and dextrose as bulk agents and natural sweeteners, natural and artificial flavorings, glycerol and lecithin as softening agents, aspartame (NutraSweet) and acesulfame K as artificial sweeteners, Yellow Lake 5 as a coloring and BHT as a preservative.\n\nWhen William Wrigley Jr. started his new business in Chicago, he began by selling his father's Scouring Soap, which he would entice customers to purchase by adding a free gift of baking powder. Unfortunately for Wrigley Jr., this ended up being far more popular than the Scouring Soap, so he switched to begin production and sales of baking powder. In 1892, Wrigley Jr. decided to give his baking powder customers a free gift, this time, attaching a few sticks of chewing gum to the box of baking powder. \n\nThe chewing gum was far more popular than the baking powder, so Wrigley Jr. again switched his business to production and sales of chewing gum. In 1893, Wrigley Jr. introduced a new flavor of gum, Juicy Fruit, which helped the Wrigley Company to become the most popular and successful chewing gum company in the world.\n\nWhen the brand first entered the market, it was packaged simply, with a plain wrapper and \"JUICY FRUIT\" in red, thin block letters. In 1914, Wrigley changed it to thin vertical white and green stripes with \"Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Chewing Gum\" centered in a stylized Maltese Cross emblem with a black background.\n\nJuicy Fruit was taken off of the civilian market temporarily during World War II because of ingredient shortages and the demand for the gum to be included in C-rations. When the gum was re introduced to the general public after World War II ended, the striped packaging was replaced by one with a bright yellow background and \"Juicy Fruit\" bracketed between two stylized chevrons, the latter a motif meant to echo the \"Wrigley arrow\" element used for Wrigley's Spearmint since 1893. \n\nThe bright yellow background remained into the 21st century, with variations since 2002 turning the arrowhead like chevrons into the corners of an elongated smile under the brand name. Juicy Fruit is still widely popular today. \n\nIn 2003 in the United States, Wrigley's replaced some of the sugar in Juicy Fruit with two artificial sweeteners, aspartame and Ace K. \n\nIn 2009, Wrigley's started selling a sugar free version of Juicy Fruit.\n\nIn Truman Capote's \"In Cold Blood\", Juicy Fruit is cited as the preferred gum choice of Perry Smith, one of the two men who killed the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959. \n\n\"Grapefruit—Juicy Fruit\" is a song written and performed by American popular music singer songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was first released on his 1973 album \"A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean\" and was his third single from that album. The single reached #23 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart in September 1973.\n\nJuicy Fruit is mentioned in the Regina Spektor song \"Wallet\", from her album \"Far\". \n\nIt is referenced in the film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" by Chief Bromden: \"Mmm, Juicy Fruit\". \n\nIt also features in the 1983 song \"Juicy Fruit\" by Mtume. Separately, a catchy Juicy Fruit jingle—\"the taste, the taste, the taste is going to move ya!\"—was widely recognizable in TV advertisements throughout the 1980s.\n\n"}

Other ingredients like ground rice or cornflour are sometimes added to alter the texture. Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt.\n\nShortbread is different from shortcake, though they are similar: shortcake can be made using vegetable fat instead of butter and usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder, which gives it a different texture. Shortbread biscuits are often associated with normal egg-based biscuits, but they hold their shape under pressure, making them ideal for packed meals.\n\nShortbread originated in Scotland, with the first printed recipe, in 1736, from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland, and the Scottish brand Walkers Shortbread is exported around the world. As a Scottish brand, shortbread is sometimes packaged in a tartan design, such as Royal Stewart tartan.\n\nShortbread is baked at a low temperature to avoid browning. When cooked, it is nearly white, or a light golden brown. It may be sprinkled with more sugar while cooling. It may even be crumbly before cooled, but will become firmer after cooling.\n\nShortbread is traditionally formed into one of three shapes: one large circle, which is divided into segments as soon as it is taken out of the oven (\"petticoat tails\", which may have been named from the French \"petits cotés\", a pointed biscuit eaten with wine, or \"petites gastelles,\" the old French for little cakes); individual round biscuits (\"shortbread rounds\"); or a thick (¾\" or 2 cm) oblong slab cut into \"fingers\".\n\nThe stiff dough retains its shape well during cooking. The biscuits are often patterned, usually with the tines of a fork before cooking or with a springerle-type cookie mold (U.S.)/biscuit mould (U.K.). Shortbread is sometimes shaped in hearts and other shapes for special occasions.\n\nShortbread is generally associated with and originated in Scotland, but due to its popularity it is also made in the remainder of the United Kingdom, and similar biscuits are also made in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. The Scottish version is the best-known, and Walkers Shortbread is Scotland's largest food exporter.\n\nShortbread was chosen as the United Kingdom's representative for Café Europe during the 2006 Austrian presidency of the European Union.\n\nScottish chef John Quigley, of Glasgow's Red Onion, describes shortbread as \"the jewel in the crown\" of Scottish baking.\n\nAn early variety of shortbread, using ginger, was reportedly eaten during sittings of the Parliament of Scotland, and therefore the variety was sometimes called \"Parliament cake\" or \"Parlies\" into the 19th century. The biscuits are likely to have been made and sold by the shop \"Luckie Fykie\" in Waverley, Edinburgh.\n\nShortbread resulted from medieval biscuit bread, which was a twice-baked, enriched bread roll dusted with sugar and spices and hardened into a hard, dry, sweetened biscuit called a rusk. Eventually, yeast from the original rusk recipe was replaced by butter, which was becoming more of a staple in Britain and Ireland.\n\nAlthough shortbread was prepared during much of the 12th century, the refinement of shortbread is credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. This type of shortbread was baked, cut into triangular wedges, and flavored with caraway seeds.\n\nShortbread was expensive and reserved as a luxury for special occasions such as Christmas, Hogmanay (Scottish New Year’s Eve), and weddings. In Shetland, it is traditional to break a decorated shortbread cake over the head of a new bride on the entrance of her new house.\n\n"}
{"id": "465125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465125", "title": "Zongzi", "text": "Zongzi\n\nZongzi (; ) is a traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves, generally of the species \"Indocalamus tessellatus\", sometimes, with reed leaves, or other large flat leaves. They are cooked by steaming or boiling. In the Western world, they are also known as rice dumplings or sticky rice dumplings.\n\nAs it diffused to other regions of Asia over many centuries, zongzi became known by various names in different languages and cultures, inclunding \"Pya Htote\" in Burmese-speaking areas (such as Myanmar), \"Nom Chang\" in Cambodia, \"Bachang\" in Indonesia and \"Khanom Chang\" in Laos and \"Ba-chang\" in Thailand.\n\nVietnamese cuisine also has a variation on this dish known as \"Bánh ú tro\" or \"Bánh tro\". \n\nIn Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, zongzi is known as \"bakcang\", \"bacang\", or \"zang\" (from Hokkien ), as Hokkien is commonly used among overseas Chinese. Similarly, zongzi is more popularly known as \"machang\" among Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines.\n\nIn some areas of the United States, particularly California and Texas, zongzi is often known as \"Chinese tamales\".\n\n\"Zongzi\" (sticky rice dumplings) are traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival (Dragon Boat Festival), which falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar (approximately late-May to mid-June).\n\nA popular belief amongst the Chinese of eating \"zongzi\" involved commemorating the death of Qu Yuan, a famous Chinese poet from the kingdom of Chu who lived during the Warring States period. Known for his patriotism, Qu Yuan tried unsuccessfully to warn his king and countrymen against the expansionism of their Qin neighbors. When the Qin general Pai Chi took Yingtu, the Chu capital, in 278 BC, Qu Yuan's grief was so intense that he drowned himself in the Miluo River after penning the Lament for Ying. According to legend, packets of rice were thrown into the river to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body.\n\nAlthough they may have originally been a seasonal food, \"zongzi\" are available year-round in most major cities with a significant Chinese population.\n\nThe shapes of \"zongzi\" vary, and range from being approximately tetrahedral in southern China to an elongated cone in northern China. Wrapping \"zongzi\" neatly is a skill that is passed down through families, as are the recipes. Making zongzi is traditionally a family event of which everyone helps out.\n\nWhile traditional \"zongzi\" are wrapped in bamboo leaves, the leaves of lotus, reed, maize, banana, canna, shell ginger and pandan sometimes are used as substitutes in other countries. Each kind of leaf imparts its own unique aroma and flavor to the rice.\n\nThe fillings used for \"zongzi\" vary from region to region, but the rice used is almost always glutinous rice (also called \"sticky rice\" or \"sweet rice\"). Depending on the region, the rice may be lightly precooked by stir-frying or soaked in water before using. In the north, fillings are mostly red bean paste and tapioca or taro. Northern style \"zongzi\" tend to be sweet and dessert-like. Southern-style \"zongzi\", however, tend to be more savory or salty. Fillings of Southern-style \"zongzi\" include salted duck egg, pork belly, taro, shredded pork or chicken, Chinese sausage, pork fat, and shiitake mushrooms.\n\n\"Zongzi\" need to be steamed or boiled for several hours depending on how the rice is prepared prior to being added, along with the fillings. However, as the modes of zongzi styles have traveled and become mixed, today one can find all kinds of zongzi at traditional markets, and their types are not confined to which side of the Yellow River they originated from.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "465529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465529", "title": "Cricket ball", "text": "Cricket ball\n\nA cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen. Movement in the air, and off the ground, is influenced by the condition of the ball, the efforts of the bowler and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimum condition is a key role of the fielding side. The cricket ball is the principal manner through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.\n\nIn day Test cricket, professional domestic games that spread over a multitude of days, and almost the entirety of amateur cricket, the traditional red cricket ball is normally used. In many one day cricket matches, a white ball is used instead in order to remain visible under floodlights, and since 2010, pink has been introduced to contrast with players' white clothing and for improved night visibility during day/night Test matches. Training balls of white, red and pink are also common, and tennis balls and other similar-sized balls can be used for training or informal cricket matches. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus can influence the match. Altering the state of the cricket ball outside the permitted manners designated in the rules of cricket is prohibited during a match, and so-called \"ball tampering\" has resulted in numerous controversies.\n\nInjuries and fatalities have been caused by cricket balls during matches. The hazards posed by cricket balls were a key motivator for the introduction of protective equipment. \nBritish Standard BS 5993 specifies the construction details, dimensions, quality and performance of cricket balls.\n\nA cricket ball is made with a core of cork, which is layered with tightly wound string, and covered by a leather case with a slightly raised sewn seam. In a top-quality ball suitable for the highest levels of competition, the covering is constructed of four pieces of leather shaped similar to the peel of a quartered orange, but one hemisphere is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other. The \"equator\" of the ball is stitched with string to form the ball's prominent seam, with six rows of stitches. The remaining two joins between the leather pieces are stitched internally forming the quarter seam. Lower-quality balls with a two-piece covering are also popular for practice and lower-level competition due to their lower cost.\n\nThe nature of the cricket ball slightly varies with its manufacturer. White Kookaburra balls are used in one-day and Twenty20 international matches, while red Kookaburras are used in test matches played in most of the ten test-playing nations, except for the West Indies and England, who use Dukes, and India, who use SG balls.\n\nCricket balls are traditionally red, and red balls are used in Test cricket and First-class cricket.\n\nWhite balls were introduced when one-day matches began being played at night under floodlights, as they are more visible at night; all professional one-day matches are now played with white balls, even when they are not played at night. The white balls have been found to behave differently to the red balls, most notably that they swing a lot more during the first half of an innings than the red ball, and that they deteriorate more quickly. Manufacturers claim that white and red balls are manufactured using the same methods and materials, other than the dying treatment of the leather. Another problem associated with white cricket balls used in One Day Internationals is that they quickly become dirty or dull in colour, which makes it more difficult for batsmen to sight the ball after 30-40 overs of use. Since October 2012, this has been managed by the use of two new white balls in each innings, with a different ball used from each bowling end; the same strategy was used in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Between October 2007 and October 2012, the issue had been managed using one new ball from the start of the innings, then swapping it at the end of the 34th over with a \"reconditioned ball\", which was neither new nor too dirty to see. Before October 2007, except during 1992 and 1996 World Cups, only one ball was used during an innings of an ODI and it was the umpires discretion to change the ball if it was difficult to see.\n\nPink balls were developed in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The red ball is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the white ball is unsuited to first-class cricket because its rapid deterioration makes it unable to be used for eighty overs as specified in the rules, so the pink ball was designed to provide a satisfactory compromise on both issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than in a red ball, which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket. A pink ball was used for the first time in an international match in July 2009 when the England Woman's team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley, and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.\n\nAs of 2014, the ball used in Test match cricket in England has a recommended retail price of 100 pounds sterling. In test match cricket this ball is used for a minimum of 80 overs (theoretically five hours and twenty minutes of play), after which the fielding side has the option of using a new ball. In professional one day cricket, at least two new balls are used for each match. Amateur cricketers often have to use old balls, or cheap substitutes, in which case the changes in the condition of the ball may not be experienced in the same manner as that which occurs during an innings of professional cricket.\n\nThere are three main manufacturers of cricket ball used in international matches: Kookaburra, Dukes and SG. The manufacturer of the red (or pink) balls used for Tests varies depending on location: India uses SG, England, Ireland and the West Indies use Dukes, and all other countries use Kookaburra. The different manufacturers' balls behave differently – \"e.g.\" Dukes balls have a prouder seam and will tend to swing more than a Kookaburra ball – providing a home advantage when playing against a team unfamiliar with the ball. All limited overs international matches, regardless of location, are played with white Kookaburra balls. White Dukes balls were used at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, but the ball behaved more erratically than the Kookaburra and has not since been used. Domestic competitions may use a domestic manufacturer: for example, Pakistan uses Grays balls in its first-class competitions.\n\nCricket balls can be bowled at close to 160 km/h (100 mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a straight course, both in the air (known as 'swinging') and off the ground (known as 'seaming'). A spin bowler imparts lateral revolutions on the ball at the point of delivery, so that when it bounces it deviates from a straight course. As cricket bats have become thicker, the ball can now be hit well over 100 metres before touching the ground.\n\nCricket commentator and former Test bowler Simon Doull noted that cricket balls produced after Cricket World Cup 2015 produced a lot less swing regardless of manufacturer. This was said to be apparent in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, even in traditionally swing-friendly British pitches, particularly with white balls, but the former West-Indian bowler Ian Bishop was unwilling to support this.\n\nIn test cricket, a new ball is used at the start of each innings in a match. In Limited Over Internationals, two new balls, one from each end, are used at the start of each innings in a match.\nA cricket ball may not be replaced except under specific conditions described in the \"Laws of Cricket\":\n\nBecause a single ball is used for an extended period of play, its surface wears down and becomes rough. The bowlers may polish it whenever they can – usually by rubbing it on their trousers, producing the characteristic red stain that can often be seen there. However, they will usually only polish one side of the ball, in order to create 'swing' as it travels through the air. They may apply saliva or sweat to the ball as they polish it.\n\nThe seam of a cricket ball can also be used to produce different trajectories through the air, with the technique known as swing bowling, or to produce sideways movement as it bounces off the pitch, with the technique known as seam bowling.\n\nSince the condition of the cricket ball is crucial to the amount of movement through the air a bowler can produce, the laws governing what players may and may not do to the ball are specific and rigorously enforced. The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to normal wear and tear due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage rate and condition will be replaced (i.e. a ball of about 30-overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same 'age').\n\nIt is illegal for a player to:\n\nDespite these rules, it can be tempting for players to gain an advantage by breaking them. There have been a handful of incidents of so-called ball tampering at the highest levels of cricket.\n\nA new cricket ball is harder than a worn one, and is preferred by fast bowlers because of the speed and bounce of the ball off the pitch. Older balls tend to spin more as the roughness grips the pitch more when the ball bounces, so spin bowlers prefer to use a worn ball, though a ball of about 8–10 overs old is still useful to a spinner as it can get more drift in the air. Uneven wear on older balls may also make reverse swing possible. A captain may delay the request for a new ball if he prefers to have his spin bowlers operating, but usually asks for the new ball soon after it becomes available.\n\nCricket balls are hard and potentially lethal, so most of today's batsmen and close fielders often wear protective equipment. Cricket ball injuries are fairly frequent, including eye (with some players having lost eyes), head and face, finger and toe, teeth and testicular injuries.\n\nFrederick, Prince of Wales (1707–1751) is often said to have died of complications after being hit by a cricket ball, although the connection between the incident and his actual cause of death is unproven. Glamorgan player Roger Davis was almost killed by a ball in 1971 when he was hit on the head while fielding. The Indian batsman Nariman 'Nari' Contractor had to retire from the game after being hit by a ball on the head in the West Indies in 1962.\n\nIn 1998, Indian cricketer Raman Lamba died when a cricket ball hit his head in a club match in Dhaka. Lamba was fielding at forward short-leg without wearing a helmet when a ball struck by batsman Mehrab Hossain hit him hard on the head and rebounded to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud.\n\nA cricket umpire, Alcwyn Jenkins, died in 2009 in Swansea, Wales after being hit on the head by a ball thrown by a fielder.\n\nOn 27 October 2013, South African cricketer Darryn Randall died after being hit on the head by the ball while batting in a Premier League match. He collapsed immediately and was rushed to the Alice Hospital where the medical staff was unable to revive him.\n\nIn November 2014, Australia and South Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died at the age of 25 at a Sydney hospital after succumbing to an injury sustained from being hit on the side of the neck by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott during a Sheffield Shield game. The same week, Hillel Oscar, an umpire and former captain of Israel's national cricket team died after being hit in the neck by a ball.\n\nOn 14 August 2017, Zubair Ahmed died after being hit on the head while batting in a club match played in the Mardan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nSometimes alternatives to a real cricket ball may be preferred for reasons of safety, availability and cost. Examples include a tennis ball and a plastic version of the cricket ball.\n\nMany casual players use a tennis ball wrapped in layers of some type of adhesive tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother. This is commonly referred to as a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the tennis ball, to provide two different sides and make it easy to bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.\n\n\n\n"}

It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The product made its debut at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Before January 2007, Cream of Wheat was a Nabisco brand made by Kraft Foods. In January 2007, B&G Foods acquired the brand and all rights to market the cereal. \"Cream of Wheat\" is a registered trademark.\n\nIn addition to its wheat-based products, the rice-based Cream of Rice is also produced as part of the product line, and is often a recommended early food for infants and toddlers and for people who cannot tolerate wheat or gluten, such as persons with celiac disease.\n\nCream of Wheat is prepared from the box by boiling water or milk, then pouring in the farina while stirring. As it is stirred, the farina starts to thicken. The use of milk instead of (or in addition to) water gives the food a creamier taste.\n\nIn the United States market, there are three unflavored mixes available (10-minute, 2 1/2-minute and 1-minute). In the Canadian market, there are two unflavored mixes available (8-minute and 3-minute).\n\nCream of Wheat is also sold as an instant formulation which includes the use of single-serving packets. These are prepared by simply mixing their contents with hot water and allowing the result to set in a bowl for approximately two minutes.\n\nIt is common to customize the hot cereal with the addition of sugar, fruit, or nuts. As a result, several flavors are sold of the instant variety: Original, Apples 'N' Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Strawberries 'N' Cream, and Cinnamon Swirl. In October 2012, Cream of Wheat added a new chocolate flavor to their instant line. Their most recent addition to the varieties of instant Cream of Wheat Cereals is Bananas & Cream.\n\nThe original boxes of Cream of Wheat were handmade and lettered, and emblazoned with the image of an African-American chef produced by Emery Mapes. The character was named Rastus, and was developed by artist Edward V. Brewer. Rastus was included on all boxes and advertisements and continues to be used today with only very slight changes. It has long been thought that a chef named Frank L. White was the model for the chef shown on the Cream of Wheat box, a claim White himself made. White's headstone contains his name and an etching taken from the man depicted on the Cream of Wheat box.\n\nFamous illustrators such as N.C. Wyeth, J.C. Leyendecker & Henry Hutt all created ads for the Cream of Wheat brand.\n\n\n"}

Variations of the typical birthday cake include birthday cupcakes, cake pops, pastries, and tarts. While there is not a universal standard regarding taste, birthday cakes are often vanilla-, chocolate-, or strawberry-flavored. They are also baked in a variety of shapes and decorated in one color or multiple colors with icing or fondant.\n\nBirthday cakes have been a part of birthday celebrations in Western European countries since the middle of the 19th century. However, the link between cakes and birthday celebrations may date back to ancient Roman times.\n\nIn classical Roman culture, 'cakes' were occasionally served at special birthdays and at weddings. These were flat circles made from flour and nuts, leavened with yeast, and sweetened with honey.\n\nIn the 15th century, bakeries in Germany began to market one-layer cakes for customers' birthdays as opposed to only marketing cakes for weddings, and thus the modern birthday cake was born. During the 17th century, the birthday cake took on its contemporary form. These elaborate 17th century cakes had many aspects of the contemporary birthday cake, like multiple layers, icing, and decorations. However, these cakes were only available to the very wealthy. Birthday cakes became accessible to the lower class as a result of the industrial revolution and the spread of more materials and goods.\n\nThe cake, pastry, or dessert is served to a person on their birthday. In contemporary Western cultures, the cake is topped with one or more lit candles, which the celebrated individual attempts to blow out.\n\nThere is no standard for birthday cakes, though the \"Happy Birthday\" song is often sung while the cake is served in English-speaking countries, or an equivalent birthday song in the appropriate language of the country. The phrase \"happy birthday\" did not appear on birthday cakes until the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" was popularized in the early 1900s. Variations of birthday songs and rituals exist in different parts of the world. In Uruguay, party guests touch the person's shoulder or head following the singing of \"Happy Birthday to You\". In Ecuador, the person whose birthday it is will take a large bite of the birthday cake before it is served. In Peru, guests used to sing \"Happy Birthday to You\" first in English with the name of the individual whose birthday it is, then in Spanish, later they sing any other song in Spanish regarding cake or date, finally blowing candles and serving the name cake.\n\nThe birthday cake is often decorated with small candles, secured with special holders or simply pressed down into the cake. The cake can also be served with other sweets such as ice cream. In the UK, North America and Australia, the number of candles is equal to the age of the individual whose birthday it is, sometimes with one extra for luck. Traditionally, the person whose birthday it is makes a wish, which is thought to come true if all the candles are extinguished in a single breath.\n\nTo represent a sharing of joy and a sense of togetherness, the cake is shared amongst all the guests attending the party.\n\nThough the exact origin and significance of the candle blowing ritual is unknown, there are multiple theories which try to explain this tradition.\n\nOne theory explaining the tradition of placing candles on birthday cakes is attributed to the early Greeks, who used candles to honor the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. The link between her oversight of fertility and the birthday tradition of candles on cakes, however, has not been established.\n\nThe use of fire in certain rites dates back to the creation of altars. Birthday candles are said to hold symbolic power.\n\nIn the past it was believed that evil spirits visited people on their birthdays and that, to protect the person whose birthday it was from evil, people must surround the individual and make them merry. Party-goers made noise to scare away evil spirits.\n\nIn 18th century Germany, the history of candles on cakes can be traced back to Kinderfest, a birthday celebration for children. This tradition also makes use of candles and cakes. German children were taken to an auditorium-like space. There, they were free to celebrate another year in a place where Germans believed that adults protected children from the evil spirits attempting to steal their souls. In those times there was no tradition of bringing gifts to a birthday; guests would merely bring good wishes for the birthday person. However, if a guest did bring gifts it was considered to be a good sign for the person whose birthday it was. Later, flowers became quite popular as a birthday gift.\n\nA reference to the tradition of blowing out the candles was documented in Switzerland in 1881. Researchers for the \"Folk-Lore Journal\" recorded various \"superstitions\" among the Swiss middle class. One statement depicted a birthday cake as having lighted candles which correspond to each year of life. These candles were required to be blown out, individually, by the person who is being celebrated.\n\nThere are many variations of sweets which are eaten around the world on birthdays. The Chinese birthday pastry is the shòu bāo (壽包, simp. 寿包) or shòu táo bāo (壽桃包, simp. 寿桃包), a lotus-paste-filled bun made of wheat flour and shaped and colored to resemble a peach. Rather than serving one large pastry, each guest is served their own small shou bao. In Korea, the traditional birthday dish is seaweed soup. In Western Russia, birthday children are served fruit pies with a birthday greeting carved into the crusts. The Swedish birthday cake is made like a pound cake that is often topped with marzipan and decorated with the national flag. Dutch birthday pastries are fruit tarts topped with whipped cream. In India there are very few people who use birth celebration in villages, but in cities and towns, birthday cakes are used similarly as in western countries, especially among people with higher education.\n\nIn many cultures the person whose birthday is being celebrated is invited to make a wish, and blow out candles.\n\nIn June 2017 researchers at Clemson University reported that some individuals deposit a large number of bacteria on the cake.\n\n"}
{"id": "468087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468087", "title": "Jolly Cola", "text": "Jolly Cola\n\nJolly Cola is an original Danish soft drink dating back to 1959. Jolly Cola is now produced by the Danish brewery Vestfyen, which also produces Jolly Light, the sports drink Jolly Time and Jolly Orange. Up until the 1980s, Jolly Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark is one of a few countries in the world, where another cola than the original Coca-Cola has had a larger market share. \nJolly Cola is probably most famous for its slogan “Say Jolly to your cola!”, but on its 50th birthday, this slogan was changed into “Free your taste”.\n\nFollowing World War II, many countries in the world viewed Coca-Cola as synonymous with the US and an American life-style, and as the US developed and increased its influence on society, so did Coca-Cola. In the meantime, the Danish population still had to wait until 1959, before they could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola.\n\nCoca-Cola had been marketed with moderate success from the middle of the 1930s, but then came a war, followed by rationing of sugar and finally a special tax on cola, which made the soft drink just as expensive as a beer, and therefore kept it out of the Danish market. The taxation came as a result of skilled lobbyism, carried out by breweries and producers of mineral water – and it worked as intended.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the tax in 1953, only 10,000 litres of cola soft drinks were sold in Denmark a year, primarily produced by minor Danish producers of mineral water, avoiding the competition from the American giant. However, the opposition against the taxation grew, and by the end of the 1950s it was only the communists and conservative powers in Danish politics, which had close connections to the brewing industry, that wanted a prohibitive surtax on what a member of the Danish Communist Party called “a bitter cup”.\nWhen the Danish producers finally realised that they could not keep Coca-Cola out of the Danish market anymore, they quickly changed their strategy. In January 1959 18 breweries and producers of mineral water went together to form ‘Dansk Coladrik A/S’. This initiative was instigated by Carlsberg and Tuborg so as to produce an original Danish cola that was to be sold nationwide. The soft drink was named Jolly Cola and was an all-out copy product. This regarded not only the taste, but also the organisation behind the product, which completely resembled Coca-Cola, especially in terms of having a strong and centralised control of quality and marketing, combined with local bottling departments. Suddenly, the strategy seemed to be that if you could not get rid of Coca-Cola, the least you could do was to ensure that the Danish population drank Danish produced cola. To a great extent, this was a success, and when the taxation was removed and ‘the great Danish cola war’ broke out in July 1959, Jolly Cola actually conquered a significant part of the new market.\n\nIn July 1959 alone, nine million bottles of Jolly Cola were sold, compared to five million bottles of Coca-Cola. This was an incredible number compared to an annual sale of 40 to 50,000 bottles in 1958. Naturally, the sheer interest of the news explains a part of the increased sale, but so does the summer of 1959, which was exceptionally good. Nevertheless, when the market finally stabilised, roughly every fifth sold soft drink in Denmark was a cola, and approximately 40% was Jolly Cola.\n\nJolly Cola maintained this market share until the 1980s.\n\nThere are several explanations for Jolly Cola’s success. However, the most important one is that ‘Dansk Coladrik’ could make use of the brewing industry’s comprehensive network, distributing system and knowledge of the Danish market. Another reason is that it was only possible to buy Coca-Cola in Copenhagen and a few larger cities in Jutland in the early years of the hectic ‘cola war’. Hence, it was not until the 1960s that it was possible to buy Coca-Cola nationwide. This ensured that Jolly Cola was a well-established product in many places when Coca-Cola finally ventured into the market. Thirdly, it was due to great marketing. Dansk Coladrik had tapped their cola in regular soft drink bottles. This made it easier for the retail industry to administer the returnable bottle system, but it also made it possible to launch Jolly Cola as “The Big Cola” (a slogan that not coincidentally resembled Pepsi’s successful 1930s US slogan for its big 12 ounce bottle). A Danish soft drink bottle contained exactly 25 cl, whereas the characteristic ‘chubby’ Coca-Cola bottle only contained 19 cl. The argument about value for your money was important in a time where a soft drink was considered to be a luxury product. (The story of Jolly Cola is based on the work of Klaus Petersen and Niels Arne Sørensen from the Institute of History, Culture and Society).\n\nIn the 1980s Jolly Cola still had around 60% of the Danish cola market, but in the 1990s they experienced a decrease in sales. In 1999 the failing sales numbers forced the Danish Consumers Cooperative Society (Coop amba) to remove Jolly Cola from its shelves. Following this, Jolly Cola only made up 6% of the total Danish soft drink market in 2002, which was again reduced to 2% in 2003. In the same year, a trial between the brewery Vestfyen and the association of Danish breweries almost compromised Jolly Cola’s existence. Vestfyen believed that the association of Danish breweries would rather market Pepsi Cola at the expense of Jolly Cola. In September 2003, however, Vestfyen took over all stocks dealing with the struggling soft drink so as to engage in a turn-around of the product. This became an immense success, and in 2004 Jolly Cola made up 25% of Coop amba's cola sales.\n\nThroughout the years Jolly Cola has provided us with numerous memorable commercials, out of which the commercial with the Danish model Tina Kjær from 1992 is probably the most famous one: \nTwo ripe fruits As well as its successor: It's grown \nAll the commercials can be seen at the following link:\nJolly Cola's Youtube channel\n\nJolly’s labels have changed a couple of times during the years. However, what they have in common is a retro design. It is the same look/design which is reappearing in the new logo. \nIn the 1980s and 1990s there were quizzes, crossword puzzles and common proverbs on the back of Jolly’s labels: \n\n"}
{"id": "469035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=469035", "title": "Rapper sword", "text": "Rapper sword\n\nRapper sword (also known as short sword dance) is a variation of sword dance that emerged from the pit villages of Tyneside in North East England, where miners first performed the tradition.\n\nThe dance requires five performers who co-ordinate themselves whilst using \"rapper swords\" made from flexible steel. Accompanied by traditional folk music, the dancers wear specially-designed shoes that allow for percussive foot movements. Mental alertness, in addition to physical agility, is required in order for dance participants to use the swords effectively without causing harm to themselves or the other performers.\n\nWhilst substantial evidence for the origins of the rapper sword tradition does not exist, as of 2012, since the publication of \"Rapper; The miner's Dance of North East England\" by Phil Heaton it is generally accepted that the dance was originally performed in the mining villages of the Northumberland and Durham coalfield in North-East England, with an intensity of activity traced to pits along both the Durham and Northumberland banks of the river Tyne. A \"hilt-and-point\" sword dance also existed in Durham, Cumberland and Yorkshire, where rigid longswords were used. A documented account of the Yorkshire dance has been located in a 1715 article, in which a fairly accurate description can be read. Later references to sword dancing in the northern counties include a dance described in 1787 in the Cumberland Packet newspaper of January 1788, and a description from Teesdale in 1778, referenced by Hutchinson in his \"View of Northumberland\".\n\nAt some stage in the nineteenth century, the rigid swords were replaced by flexible rappers in the coalfield. Very little is known about this major development in the tradition because of an absence of sufficient evidence, and it may have been entirely accidental. It used to be commonly thought that the flexible version was used for removing dirt from the backs of pit ponies, but there is no available documentation to verify this theory. It seems that two factors have influenced interpretations of when the rapper sword was introduced: firstly, the relocation of a steel works operation by Ambrose Crowley to the Derwent Valley, before which time it is believed that suitable steel for flexible swords would most likely have been unavailable; and secondly, the prohibitive expense of such instruments before the Bessemer process in 1855 that allowed steel to be made inexpensively.\n\nThe dance involves five people, with many including characters, such as Tommy and Betty, who announce the dance, engage the audience and most importantly, collect money from the onlookers. The performers are connected by short swords bearing two handles, with the handle on at least one end being fixed. The other handle is either fixed or swivelling, based on the preference of the rapper side. The flexible rapper swords form an unbroken chain connecting the dancers. The dance is related to the Long Sword dance of Yorkshire, as well as other sword dances in Europe. Some of the earliest teams used hornpipes, rather than the jigs used in the modern era.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, teams of rapper dancers from the pit villages of Tyneside, and Wearside, would travel annually to the towns of Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland and Durham to perform the dance for the crowds, asking for monetary consideration. This was later revived as a source of income during the miners' strikes and lay-offs, especially when the collieries were closed down over winter. Sword dancers of the North East were also active in the political struggles of the coalfield. A team of Tyneside Rovers were part of an early march on parliament in 1890, and another team from Hebburn were part of the famous Jarrow Crusade in 1936. Teams were also reported all over Durham and Northumberland as dancing out and collecting in the 1926 miners' strike and later in the Great Depression.\n\nBy the early twentieth century, the tradition was beginning to die out, but was revived by the interest generated after Cecil Sharp published notations for five of the traditional village dances in his book, \"The Sword Dances of Northern England\". After the First World War, the revival was marked by the fierce competition between pit villages in the rapper classes of the newly instituted \"North of England Musical Tournament\" held annually in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the tradition progressively declined in the original pit villages, partly as a result of social changes in the mining communities. However, another revival was initiated after the war, in 1949 by students at Kings College in Newcastle upon Tyne (now the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), which subsequently spread beyond the traditional area. Revival teams worldwide now perform the rapper tradition, sometimes learned from published notations, sometimes taught by rapper dancers in what is almost a continuation of the earlier oral traditions.\n\nThe dance has transformed as it moved into the twenty-first century: the pace has quickened and is performed at around 140–160 beats per minute, with different team styles using different rates. It is nonetheless typically performed in a smooth and graceful manner, with one figure flowing seamlessly into the next. A number of acrobatic figures can be employed, including forward and backward somersaults over the swords.\n\nThe dance is now almost always performed to jigs (perhaps 90% of the time), with the normal form of rapper stepping being a form of shuffle imported from the local clogging tradition. The jigs used include local tunes and many instruments can, and have been, used to accompany rapper dances (the most popular being fiddles, tin whistles and accordions or melodeons). Many rapper jigs used for the last hundred years are tunes, probably imported by Irish and Scottish immigrants to Tyneside in the nineteenth century. The music is usually performed solo, although it can be performed as a duet; however, rapper is not usually performed to a band. There is much controversy in the rapper community over the use of any form of percussion to accompany rapper beyond the rapper stepping included in the dance. \n\nIn modern times, the competitive element of rapper sword dancing has been revived in the form of the Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT) competition, and in recent years its American counterpart, Dancing America Rapper Tournament (DART).\n\nThe costume in which the dance is usually performed, referred to as the \"kit\", is a stylised version of the working clothes of the local nineteenth century coal miner (\"see photograph, left\"). It consists of shirt; sash; breeches, \"hoggers\" (similar to breeches but shorter), or long trousers; and socks or stockings. Some traditional teams decorated their kit with ribbons or rosettes, and added a tie and/or waistcoat.\n\nModern teams use a variety of kits, mostly based on the traditional costume, with each team using different combinations of colours to try to have a unique corporate image. Some other modern sides, especially women's sides, use very different kits.\n\nThe Rapper Online website provides information on the origins and history of the dance, team listings, and notations of traditional dances. Current and historical information is also available at \"The NUT on the Net\", the Internet edition of \"The NUT\", the journal of the rapper sword dance.\n\nLeading exponents of the tradition in its traditional area include the High Spen Blue Diamonds, the Newcastle Kingsmen, Monkseaton Morris Men, the Sallyport Sword Dancers and Star and Shadow. The Rapper Online website provides a list of rapper sword teams and the Sword Dance Union has produced a map of current UK teams.\n\nThe Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT) competition, which is open to all rapper sword teams, is held annually in a different UK city or town by a different Rapper side. The tournament is made up of 3 divisions: Premier, Championship, and Open, as well as recently adding a youth competition, DERTy. \n\nIn 2019, the competition is being hosted by The Newcastle Kingsmen, Sallyport Sword Dancers, and Star and Shadow Rapper on the 5–7th of April in Newcastle.\n\nRapper dancing has gained international popularity. Jack The Rapper, based in Norway, attended DERT in 1996, 1999 and 2003. The DERT 2005 and 2006 competitions were attended by three teams from the United States, named Candyrapper (2005), Beside the Point (2006) and Scrambled Six (2007). Red Mum Rapper from Denmark competed in DERTs 2013, 2014 and 2016. The Pocket Flyers (USA) attended DERT 2015 in Bristol. Rapper teams also exist in Australia, Germany and the Basque Country of France.\n\n\n"}

Bulmer in England since 1962. Strongbow is the world's leading cider with a 15 per cent volume share of the global cider market and a 29 per cent volume share of the UK cider market. Bulmer's is a subsidiary of Heineken International, the multinational Dutch brewer.\n\nIn 2011, Strongbow Gold, produced in Belgium, was launched across Europe in response to cider's growing popularity on the continent. In 2012, Strongbow was the highest selling cider in Australia, and was the second highest selling cider in North America.\n\nThe majority of Strongbow is produced at Bulmer's Hereford plant, although regional variations are also produced at Heineken's cider mill in Belgium and in Australia, where SABMiller own the rights to the brand.\n\nStrongbow was launched in England by H.P. Bulmer in 1962. Bulmer named the cider after “one of England’s greatest knights” Richard de Clare, whose nickname \"Strongbow\" was believed to be derived from his heavy reliance on archers during his campaigns in Ireland. However, this theory is unlikely to be true because de Clare's father, Gilbert de Clare, was originally known as “Strongbow”, which suggests that Richard's nickname was actually inherited from his father. It was initially marketed as \"the strong cider for men\". By 1970, it was the second highest selling cider in the world after its Bulmer's stablemate Woodpecker. The Times (London) 27 March 2001, Tuesday Cider joins favourite pub drinks</ref> By 2001, Strongbow was among the top ten drinks by sales in English and Welsh pubs and bars. In 2003 Bulmers was purchased by Scottish & Newcastle, who in turn were taken over by Heineken in 2008. In January 2011, Heineken announced their intention to take the Strongbow brand global.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Strongbow is a blend of bitter-sweet cider and culinary apples, with 50 different varieties of apple used. The apples are grown in England and France. It is mass-produced using modern methods, and contains apple concentrate and sugar. It is fermented with a controlled yeast strain, and at least some varieties are flavoured with artificial sweeteners. The Bulmers Strongbow vat is the largest alcoholic container in the world, with a capacity of 1.5 million gallons (6.8 million litres).\n\nIn the UK, Strongbow is available on draught at 4.5% ABV and in cans and bottles at 5% ABV. In 2012 the UK packaged versions were reduced from 5.3% ABV to 5.0% ABV.\n\nStrongbow Gold is the variant available in mainland Europe and is available only in bottles. It was launched in May 2011, and its major markets include Italy and Hungary. It is 5% ABV and designed to be served over ice. It is over 50% apple juice, making it a similar product to Magners and Stella Cidre. It also contains glucose syrup, glucose-fructose syrup, food acidifier: malic acid, anti-oxidant: sulphur dioxide, colouring agent: cochineal, burned sugar. It is made in Belgium at Heineken's Stassen plant. However, the version of Strongbow Gold Apple available in Slovakia contains only 25% apple juice; in that version the colouring is E150a caramel . \n\nStrongbow is exported to numerous overseas markets. Sleeman Breweries took over the distribution rights for Canada in 2001, and is the fifth highest selling cider in the United States, where it was imported by Vermont Hard Cider until August 2012, when Heineken regained the rights. It was launched into the Australian market in 1970, and today still remains as Australia's most popular cider. Strongbow is available in five varieties in Australia: Dry, Sweet, Original (formerly sold as \"Draught\"), Clear (a low carbohydrate variety) and Pear. Foster's Group purchased the Strongbow brand in Australia in 2003, and continues to produce, distribute & market the brand. They were themselves purchased by SABMiller in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Heineken launched \"Strongbow Pear\" in the UK and in 2013 introduced \"Strongbow Dark Fruit\" which contains blackcurrant and blackberry juices. In 2014, \"Strongbow Citrus Edge\" was introduced, which contains lemon and lime. 2015 saw the introduction of \"Cloudy Apple\", a scrumpy version of the cider.\n\nIn 2014 in the US, Heineken launched two new sweeter flavours, dubbed \"Gold Apple\" and \"Honey & Apple\". Strongbow subsequently discontinued the original dry cider Strongbow flavor in the USA. The move to discontinue the original dry cider recipe in the US and replace it with two sweeter varieties was criticized by some vocal customers, with comments related to the discontinuation appearing on various internet forums, the Strongbow Facebook page, and the USA Heineken Strongbow web page. However, in May 2018, Heineken announced that it would bring back the original dry cider to the United States in 16.9 ounce cans, which it did the following month.\n\nIn 2015 in the US, a variety pack was released, which includes the two existing flavors \"Gold Apple\" and \"Honey & Apple\" along with two additional flavors \"Red Berries\" and \"Ginger.\" \"Cherry Blossom\" was introduced in 2016.\n\nPreviously Strongbow White was available in Australia, which had a much higher alcohol content (8.5%). It ceased production sometime after 2000.\n\n\"Strongbow Sirrus\" (5% ABV), was launched in summer 2005 to compete with C&C's Magners Original Irish Cider. Sirrus was formulated as a 'smooth' cider designed to be poured over ice, and was only available in bottles; it has since been discontinued.\n\nIn 2007, the company began trials of \"Strongbow On Ice\", a competitor to other ciders that are served over ice. This uses a specially designed pump that creates a \"head\" of ice made from cider on the top of the pint. Trials were unsuccessful however, and the product was discontinued.\n\nStrongbow Black (previously Strongbow Super) at 7.5% ABV, was delisted by Heineken in 2011 on social responsibility grounds.\n\nThe original Norman archer logo was designed by artist Barney Bubbles. The \"thudding arrows\" have been a signature of the brand's television advertising since the 1960s. Towards the end of the advertisement, two arrows thud into a bar counter near a glass of Strongbow, or its bar pump.\n\nAdvertisements from 1998 to 2002 featured Johnny Vaughan and the \"live to loaf\" line. The campaign focused on Vaughan's character, who was always finding new ways to get the most out of life with the minimum effort. Vaughan was credited by Bulmers with giving credibility to the Strongbow brand among the key 18 to 24-year-old group. Between 1998 and 2000 Strongbow sales rose by 30 per cent.\n\nIn 2010 TV adverts in the UK were based on the \"medal ceremony\" scene at the end of the \"\" film: three men walk down an aisle flanked by large numbers of men; step up a raised podium at the far end; and receive a reward – a pint of Strongbow – for their \"heroic deeds\" (i.e.: performing their ordinary jobs). Adverts in 2012 showed fanciful representations of normal situations (goalkeeping, potting a black ball, best man's speech) where those seen in the advert would be next seen drinking Strongbow having \"earnt it\" for accomplishing such situations. The latest advert depicts a duplex-style apple orchard divided between bitter and sweet reflecting Strongbow being \"bittersweet by nature\".\n\nIn 2015, Strongbow began its \"Cider at its Bestest\" campaign in the US, featuring Patrick Stewart.\n\nStrongbow were official shirt sponsors of Edinburgh football club Heart of Midlothian from 1992–2002. Strongbow also sponsored Leeds United Football Club from 2000–2003. Strongbow reputedly paid £3 million a year for the rights.\n\n\n"}

This flag was approved by the passage of a bill in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly on May 11, 1965 and was officially proclaimed on May 12, 1966. Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for the use of the Union device the preceding year (October 1965). The decision to adopt the flag was made after the federal government decided to replace the Canadian Red Ensign with the Maple Leaf flag, which was quite controversial at the time. The Manitoban flag, intentionally designed to resemble the Canadian red ensign, was seen as a way of preserving heritage that some felt was lost when the national flag was changed. The flag of Ontario was adopted under similar circumstances.\n\nIn 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed the Manitoba provincial flag 44th in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territory flags ranked, which was the last placed Canadian flag.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "471952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471952", "title": "King cake", "text": "King cake\n\nA king cake (sometimes shown as kingcake, kings' cake, king's cake, or three kings' cake) is a type of cake associated in a number of countries with the festival of Epiphany at the end of the Christmas season; in other places, it is associated with the pre-Lenten celebrations of Mardi Gras/Carnival.\n\nWhat started out roughly 300 years ago as a dry French bread–type dough with sugar on top and a bean inside now comes in many varieties depending on the country. Some king cakes are made of a sweet brioche dough in the shape of a hollow circle with a glazed topping sprinkled with colored sugar. Hundreds of thousands of king cakes are eaten in New Orleans during the Carnival season. In other countries, king cakes are made with a puff pastry, filled with one of several fillings (e.g., almond, apple, chocolate/pear, etc.), and have a small figurine, called a fève, hidden inside. The figurine changes from bakery to bakery and can have a variety of themes. The person who gets the piece of cake with the fève has various privileges and obligations.\n\nThe \"king cake\" takes its name from the biblical kings. In Western Christian liturgical tradition, the Solemnity of Epiphany—commemorated on January 6—celebrates the visit of the Magi to the Christ Child. The Eve of Epiphany (the night of January 5) is popularly known as Twelfth Night (the Twelve Days of Christmas are counted from Christmas Eve until this night). The season for king cake extends from the end of the Twelve Days of Christmas (Twelfth Night and Epiphany Day), up until the end of Shrovetide: Mardi Gras, \"Fat Tuesday,\" or Shrove Tuesday; the day before the start of Lent. Some organizations or groups of friends may have \"king cake parties\" every week through the Carnival season. In Portugal and France, whoever gets the King cake trinket is expected to buy the next cake for these get-togethers.\n\nIt is a popular food item during the Christmas season (Christmas Eve to Epiphany) in Belgium, France, Quebec and Switzerland (\"galette\" or \"gâteau des Rois\" or \"galette des rois\"), Portugal (\"bolo rei\"), Spain and Latin America (\"roscón\" or \"rosca de reyes\") and, Greece and Cyprus (\"vasilopita\") and Bulgaria (\"banitsa\"). In the United States, Carnival is traditionally observed in the Southeastern region of the country, particularly in New Orleans, Bay Saint Louis, Mobile, Pensacola, Galveston, and other towns and cities of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\n\nIn these regions, the king cake is closely associated with Mardi Gras traditions and is served throughout the Carnival season, which lasts from Epiphany Eve to Fat Tuesday. The King Cake tradition is thought to have been brought to New Orleans from France in 1870. Now, as part of the celebration, it is traditional to bake a cake (King Cake) in honor of the three kings. The official colors of Mardi Gras – created in 1872 by the Krewe of Rex – are purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.\n\nRelated culinary traditions are the \"tortell\" of Catalonia, the \"gâteau des Rois\" or \"reiaume\" in Provence or the \"galette des Rois\" in the northern half of France, \"bolo rei\" of Portugal, and the Greek and Cypriot \"vasilopita\". The \"galette des Rois\" is made with puff pastry and frangipane (while the \"gâteau des Rois\" is made with brioche and candied fruits). A little bean was traditionally hidden in it, a custom taken from the Saturnalia in the Roman Empire: the one who stumbled upon the bean was called \"king of the feast.\" In the \"galette des Rois\", since 1870 the beans have been replaced first by porcelain and now by plastic figurines.\n\nNow replaced by the Christmas cake, a similar tradition was also followed in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe cake traditionally celebrating Epiphany in France and Quebec is sold in most bakeries during the month of January. Three versions exist: in northern France, Quebec, and Belgium the cake called \"galette des rois\" in French or \"Koningentaart\" in Flemish/Dutch (which can be either circular or rectangular) consists of flaky puff pastry layers with a dense center of frangipane or apple. In the west of France a sablé galette is made, a form of sweetcrust pastry. In southern France—Occitania, Roussillon, Provence, Catalan where it is called \"tortell\"—the cake called \"gâteau des rois\" or \"royaume\", is a torus-shaped brioche with candied fruits and sugar, similar in its shape and colors to a crown. This later version is also common to Spain and very similar to New-Orleans king cake.\n\nTradition holds that the cake is \"to draw the kings\" to the Epiphany. A figurine, \"la fève\", which can represent anything from a car to a cartoon character, is hidden in the cake and the person who finds the trinket in his or her slice becomes king for the day and will have to offer the next cake. Originally, \"la fève\" was literally a broad bean (\"fève\"), but it was replaced in 1870 by a variety of figurines out of porcelain or—more recently—plastic. These figurines have become popular collectibles and can often be bought separately. Individual bakeries may offer a specialized line of fèves depicting diverse themes from great works of art to classic movie stars and popular cartoon characters. The cakes are usually sold in special bags, some of which can be used to heat the cake in a microwave without ruining the crispness of the cake. A paper crown is included with the cake to crown the \"king\" who finds the fève in their piece of cake. To ensure a random distribution of the cake shares, it is traditional for the youngest person to place him- or herself under the table and name the recipient of the share which is indicated by the person in charge of the service.\n\nFormerly, the cake was divided into as many shares as there were guests, plus one. The latter, called \"the share of God,\" \"share of the Virgin Mary,\" or \"share of the poor\" was intended for the first poor person to arrive at the home.\n\nThe \"roscón de reyes\" in Spain or \"rosca de reyes\" in Latin America is traditionally eaten on January 6, during the celebration of the \"Día de los reyes magos\" (Epiphany or the \"Day of the Three Wisemen\"). In most of Spain, Mexico and in Latino communities in the United States, this is the day when children get presents from the Three Wise Men. Before going to bed, children in Mexico and other Latin American countries, such as Argentina, leave a shoe outside their home or room, filled with hay or dried grass and a bowl of water as a present for the animals the \"reyes\" ride, along with a note for the \"reyes\". The \"roscón de reyes\" has an oval shape to symbolize a crown. For decoration, people sometimes use dried and candied fruits such as figs, quince or cherries. The fruit symbolizes the many jewels that a crown would have.\n\nThe tradition of placing a bean, candy or figurine of the baby Jesus inside the cake is followed. Whoever finds it must take it to the nearest church on February 2, \"Día de la candelaria\" (Candlemas Day), which celebrates the presentation of Jesus in the Temple. According to the Jewish tradition, an infant was to be presented to God in the Temple forty days after his birth. The use of candles on Candlemas represents the light of Christ presented to the world. In Mexico and the Mexican diaspora in the United States, people who find the baby Jesus figurine in their piece of cake usually agree to host a party on Candlemas (February 2) and to provide the guests with tamales and atole.\n\nIn Argentina, the tradition of consuming a \"rosca\" on January 6 is also followed, although no figurine is included. In addition, a similar version with whole cooked eggs on top of the cake is also served on Easter as \"rosca de Pascua\".\n\nIn some places, the \"rosca de reyes\" is replaced by panettone.\n\nIn the southern United States, the tradition was brought to the area by Basque settlers in 1718. Originally, it was a cinnamon-filled bready cake eaten to celebrate Epiphany, but it is now associated with Carnival (also known as Mardi Gras). Celebrated across the Gulf Coast region from the Florida Panhandle to East Texas, King cake parties are documented back to the 18th century.\n\nThe king cake of the Louisiana tradition comes in a number of styles. The most simple, said to be the most traditional, is a ring of twisted cinnamon roll-style dough. It may be topped with icing or sugar, which may be colored to show the traditional Mardi Gras colors of green, yellow, and purple. King cakes may also be filled with additional fillings, the most common being cream cheese, praline, cinnamon, or strawberry. A so-called \"Zulu King Cake\" has chocolate icing with a coconut filling, because the Krewe of Zulu parade's most celebrated throw is a coconut. Some bakers now offer king cakes for other holidays that immediately surround the Mardi Gras season, such as king cakes with green and red icing for Christmas, cakes with pink and red icing for Valentine's Day, and cakes with green and white icing for St. Patrick's Day. Others have gone a step further and produce specialty king cakes from the beginning of football season for Louisiana State University and New Orleans Saints tailgate parties, then for Halloween, then Thanksgiving—and do not cease until after Mardi Gras season, when they produce an Easter holiday king cake.\n\nIn the Southern culture, whoever finds the trinket must provide the next king cake or host the next Mardi Gras party.\n\nA King cake – normally referred to as a \"Twelfth Cake\", \"Twelfth-night cake\", or \"Twelfth-tide cake\" – was once popular in the United Kingdom on Twelfth Night. It was frequently baked with a bean hidden in one side and a pea hidden in the other; the man finding the bean became King for the night, while the lady finding the pea became the Queen - also known as the Lord or Lady of Misrule. Earlier, in the time of Shakespeare, there was only a Lord of Misrule, chosen by the hidden bean, reflected in Shakespeare's play \"Twelfth Night\"\n\nSamuel Pepys recorded a party in London on Epiphany night, 6 January 1659/1660, and described the role the cake played in the choosing of a \"King\" and \"Queen\" for the occasion: \"...to my cousin Stradwick, where, after a good supper, there being there my father, mothers, brothers, and sister, my cousin Scott and his wife, Mr. Drawwater and his wife, and her brother, Mr. Stradwick, we had a brave cake brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was Queen and Mr. Stradwick was King. After that my wife and I bid adieu and came home, it being still a great frost.\"\n\nAlthough still occasionally found in the United Kingdom, as the Industrial Revolution curtailed the celebration of the 12 days of Christmas during the Victorian era, the cake declined in popularity to be replaced by the Christmas cake. 18th century actor Robert Baddeley's will bequeathed £3 per annum to serve wine, punch and a Twelfth Night cake to the performers of the Drury Lane Theatre in the green room each Twelfth Night; the ceremony of the \"Baddeley Cake\" has remained a regular event, missed only 13 times in over 200 years, during wartimes or theatre closures.\n\nStarting on Epiphany on January 6, residents begin holding parties especially dedicated to King Cake. King Cake parties bring families and community members together to celebrate the season of Mardi Gras, with its krewe parades and festivals. King Cake is so symbolic of the Mardi Gras celebration for residents it is believed that consuming King Cake outside of the Carnival season will result in rain on Mardi Gras day. The dessert's \"search for the baby,\" the small figurine located inside the cake, is a fun way for residents of New Orleans to celebrate their Christian faith.\n\nThe dessert's significance to the city was evident in the first Mardi Gras season (2006) after Hurricane Katrina: people placed thousands of King Cake orders to bakeries as displaced New Orleanians craved connection with tradition and wanted to share their Carnival culture.\n\nSome sports teams around the area have also infused the tradition of the king cake baby into their teams. The Miami Marlins AAA minor league baseball affiliate, formerly known as the New Orleans Zephyrs, changed their name to the New Orleans Baby Cakes, starting in the 2017 season. The New Orleans Pelicans introduced the King Cake Baby as a second mascot during games around Mardi Gras, to accompany their main mascot, Pelican Pierre.\n\nTraditionally, a small plastic or porcelain baby is hidden in the king cake. Originally, the baby was placed in the cake to symbolize baby Jesus. Fava beans were also used to represent Jesus.\n\nToday, the baby symbolizes luck and prosperity to whoever finds it in his/her slice of cake. That person is also responsible for purchasing next year's cake, or for throwing the next Mardi Gras party. In some traditions, the finder of the baby is designated \"king\" or \"queen\" for the evening.\n\nAs beans and porcelain figures became replaced with plastic babies, many bakers have recently been placing the baby outside of the cake, and leaving the hiding to the customer. This is also because there is a potential of customers choking on or swallowing the baby, and bakers want to stay clear of this liability.\n\nThere are many different recipes for king cake. However, the most common ones include: milk, butter, yeast, water, brown and white sugar, eggs, salt, nutmeg, flour and cinnamon. The frosting is typically made from confectioner's sugar, water, lemon juice, and colored sugar crystals.\n\nThe colors of the king cake originally came from the Christian religion. The purple symbolizes justice, the green symbolizes faith, and the gold symbolizes power. The three colors honor the three kings who visited the Christ child (Jesus) on Epiphany, the 12th day after Christmas.\n"}

The eggs are cracked into a bowl with some salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked: alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. Ground black pepper is also sometimes used as an ingredient. More consistent and far quicker results are obtained if a small amount of thickener such as cornstarch, potato starch or flour is added; this enables much quicker cooking with reduced risk of overcooking, even when less butter is used.\n\nThe mixture can be poured into a hot pan containing melted butter or oil, where it starts coagulating. The heat is turned down and the eggs are stirred as they cook. This creates small, soft curds of egg. Unlike pancake or omelette scrambled egg is virtually never browned. A thin pan is preferable to prevent browning. With continuous stirring, and not allowing the eggs to stick to the pan, the eggs themselves will maintain the pan temperature at about the boiling point of water, until they coagulate.\n\nOnce the liquid has mostly set, additional ingredients such as ham, herbs, cheese or cream may be folded in over low heat until incorporated. The eggs are usually slightly undercooked when removed from heat, since the eggs will continue to set. If any liquid is seeping from the eggs (syneresis), this is a sign of undercooking, overcooking or adding undercooked high-moisture vegetables.\n\nScrambled eggs can be cooked in a microwave oven, and can also be prepared using sous-vide cooking, which gives the traditional smooth creamy texture and requires only occasionally mixing during cooking. Another technique for cooking creamy scrambled eggs is to pipe steam into eggs with butter via a steam wand (as found on an espresso machine).\n\n\nClassical haute cuisine preparation calls for serving scrambled eggs in a deep silver dish. They can also be presented in small croustades made from hollowed-out brioche or tartlets. When eaten for breakfast, scrambled eggs often accompany toast, bacon, smoked salmon, hash browns, cob, pancakes, ham or sausages. Popular condiments served with scrambled eggs include ketchup, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.\n\n\n"}

It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb \"souffler\" which means \"to blow\", \"to breathe\", \"to inflate\" or \"to puff\".\n\nThe earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook Vincent de la Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.\n\nSoufflés are typically prepared from two basic components:\n\nThe base provides the flavor and the egg whites provide the \"lift\", or puffiness to the dish. Foods commonly used to flavor the base include herbs, cheese and vegetables for savory soufflés and jam, fruits, berries, chocolate, banana and lemon for dessert soufflés.\n\nSoufflés are generally baked in individual ramekins of a few ounces or soufflé dishes of a few liters: these are typically glazed, flat-bottomed, round porcelain containers with unglazed bottoms, vertical or nearly vertical sides, and fluted exterior borders. The ramekin, or other baking vessel, may be coated with a thin film of butter to prevent the soufflé from sticking. Some preparations also include adding a coating of sugar, bread crumbs, or a grated hard cheese such as parmesan inside the ramekin in addition to the butter; some cooks believe this allows the soufflé to rise more easily.\n\nAfter being cooked, a soufflé is puffed up and fluffy, and it will generally fall after 5 or 10 minutes (as risen dough does). It may be served with a sauce atop the soufflé, such as a sweet dessert sauce, or with a sorbet or ice-cream on the side. When served, the top of a soufflé may be punctured with serving utensils to separate it into individual servings. This can also enable a sauce to integrate into the dish.\n\nThere are a number of both savory and sweet soufflé flavor variations. Savory soufflés often include cheese, and vegetables such as spinach, carrot and herbs, and may sometimes incorporate poultry, bacon, ham, or seafood for a more substantial dish. Sweet soufflés may be based on a chocolate or fruit sauce (lemon or raspberry, for example), and are often served with a dusting of powdered sugar. Frugal recipes sometimes emphasize the possibilities for making soufflés from leftovers.\n\nA soufflé may be served alone or with ice cream, fruit, or a sauce.\n\nSoufflés are occasionally depicted in cartoons, comedies and children's programs as a source of humor. Often this involves a loud noise or poke causing the soufflé to collapse, usually to the embarrassment and dismay of the character who prepared the soufflé or the dejection of the character being served the anticipated dessert.\n\n\n\n"}

The objective of the game is for a player to have their partners guess the word on the player's card without using the word itself or five additional words listed on the card.\n\nThe game is similar to Catch Phrase, also from Hasbro, in which a player tries to get his or her teammates to guess words using verbal clues.\n\nSome early editions included a board to track progress (as shown in the photo on this page).\n\nThe second edition of the game, produced in 1994, has a round, pink squeaker, or hooter, instead of a buzzer, as do the 1993 and 1990 editions.\n\nTaboo Junior, the game for younger players, includes a purple squeaker, as do a few of the other editions from 1996 and 2002 as well as 2012.\n\nIn 1990, Hasbro sold packs of additional words, but they are no longer in production.\n\nAn even number of players from four to ten sit alternating around in a circle. Players take turns as the \"giver,\" who attempts to prompt his or her teammates to guess as many keywords as possible in the allotted time. However, each card also has \"taboo\" (forbidden) words listed which may not be spoken. Should the giver say one, a \"censor\" on the opposing team hits the buzzer and the giver must move on to the next word. For example, the giver might have to get his or her team to deduce the word \"baseball\" without offering the words \"sport,\" \"game,\" \"pastime,\" \"hitter,\" \"pitcher,\" or \"baseball\" itself as clues. The giver may not say a part of a \"taboo\" word; for example, using \"base\" in \"baseball\" is taboo. Nor may they use a form of a word; for example, if the word was \"wedding\" and the taboo words are \"marriage,\" \"bride,\" \"groom,\" \"nuptials,\" or \"honeymoon,\" the words \"marry\" and \"bridal\" would not be allowed. The giver may only use speech to prompt his or her teammates; gestures, sounds (e.g. barking), or drawings are not allowed. Singing is permitted, provided the singer is singing words rather than humming or whistling a tune. The giver's hints may rhyme with a taboo word, or be an abbreviation of a taboo word.\n\nWhile the giver is prompting the teammates they may make as many guesses as they want with no penalties for wrong guesses. Once the team correctly guesses the word exactly as written on the card, the giver moves on to the next word, trying to get as many words as possible in the allotted time. When time runs out, play passes to the next adjacent player of the other team. The playing team receives one point for correct guesses and one penalty point if \"taboo\" words are spoken.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is named after Hall of Famer Gordie Howe, who is known as \"Mr. Hockey\", because he is considered the most well rounded hockey player of all time. Howe could both set up and score goals, but also do everything well from killing penalties, back checking, and even fighting, when necessary.\n\nThe first known Gordie Howe hat trick was achieved by Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Harry Cameron of the Toronto Arenas on December 26, 1917 in a 7–5 win against the Montreal Canadiens. \n\n\nA multiple Gordie Howe hat trick, involving two players who each scored a goal and got and assist and then fought each other, has occurred on two occasions:\n\nOn April 9, 1981, during a play-off game between the Minnesota North Stars and the Boston Bruins, Bryan Maxwell and Bobby Smith of the Minnesota North Stars and Brad Park of the Boston Bruins all got Gordie Howe Hat Tricks.

{"id": "474943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=474943", "title": "Soy milk", "text": "Soy milk\n\nSoy milk or soymilk is a plant-based drink produced by soaking and grinding soybeans, boiling the mixture, and filtering out remaining particulates. It is a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein. Its original form is a natural by-product of the manufacture of tofu. It became a common beverage in Europe and North America in the latter half of the 20th century, especially as production techniques were developed to give it taste and consistency more closely resembling dairy milk. Along with similar vegetable-based \"milks\", like almond and rice milk, soy milk may be used as a substitute for dairy milk by individuals who are vegan or lactose intolerant.\n\nIn China, the usual term \"doujiang\" (\"[soy]bean broth\") is used for the traditional watery and beany beverage produced as a by-product of the production of tofu, whereas store-bought products designed to imitate the flavor and consistency of dairy milk are more often known as \"dounai\" (\"[soy]bean milk\"). In other countries, there are sometimes legal impediments to the equivalents of the name \"soy milk\". For example, in the European Union, \"'Milk' means exclusively the normal mammary secretion obtained from one or more milkings without either addition thereto or extraction therefrom\". Often, only cow's milk is allowed to be named \"milk\" on its packaging, and any other milks must state the name of the respective animal: \"goat milk\" or \"sheep milk\". In such jurisdictions, the manufacturers of plant milks typically label their products the equivalent of \"soy beverage\" or \"soy drink\".\n\nSoybeans originated in northeastern China and appear to have been domesticated around the 11th century, but its use in soups and beverages are only attested at much later dates. Soy gruel was first noted in the 3rd century, soy \"wine\" in the 4th century, and a tofu broth (\"doufujiang\") amid the collapse of the Mongol Yuan. As \"doujiang\", this drink remains a common watery form of soy milk in China, usually prepared from fresh soybeans. Its popularity increased during the Qing dynasty, apparently due to the discovery that gently heating \"doujiang\" for at least 90 minutes hydrolyzed its raffinose and stachyose, oligosaccharides which can cause flatulence and digestive pain among lactose-intolerant adults. By the 18th century, it was popular enough that street vendors were hawking it; in the 19th, it was also common to take a cup to tofu shops to get hot, fresh \"doujiang\" for breakfast. It was already often paired with youtiao, which was dipped into it. The process was industrialized in early Republican China. By 1929, two Shanghai factories were selling over 1000 bottles a day and another in Beijing was almost as productive itself. Following disruption from the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War, soy milk began to be marketed in soft drink-like fashion in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan in the 1950s.\n\nThe first non-dairy milk—almond milk—was created in the Levant around the 13th century and had spread to England by the 14th. Soymilk was mentioned in various European letters from China beginning in the 17th century. \"Soy milk\" entered the English language (as \"soy-bean milk\") in an 1897 USDA report. Li Yuying established Caséo-Sojaïne, the first soy milk \"dairy\", in Colombes, France, in 1910; he received the first British and American patents for soy milk's manufacture in 1912 and 1913. J.A. Chard began production of \"Soy Lac\" in New York City, United States, in 1917. Harry W. Miller—an American businessman forced to relocate his factory from Shanghai owing to World War II—was similarly compelled by the USDA and the US dairy industry to use the term \"Soya Lac\" rather than \"soy milk\". John Harvey Kellogg had been working with what he called \"soymilk\" at his Battle Creek Sanitarium since 1930, but was similarly compelled to market his acidophilus-enriched beverage as \"Soygal\" when it began commercial production in 1942. A string of 40 court cases against Rich Products between 1949 and 1974 finally established that non-dairy \"milks\" and imitation dairy products were \"a new and distinct food\", rather than inferior and illegal knock-offs. Cornell researchers established the enzyme lipoxygenase's responsibility for soy milk's \"beany\" flavor in 1966; the same research established a process for reducing or eliminating it from commercial products. With Tetra Pak cartons extending its shelf-life, Hong Kong-based Vitasoy reintroduced soy milk to the US market in 1980 and brought it to 20 other countries within a few years. Alpro similarly began production in Belgium in 1980, quickly becoming Europe's leading producer. New production technology and techniques began to permit soy beverages with an appreciably more milk-like flavor and consistency in the mid-1980s.\n\nA cup (243 ml) serving of a generic unsweetened commercial nutrient-fortified brand of soy milk provides 80 calories from 4 g of carbohydrates (including 1 g of sugar), 4 g of fat and 7 g of protein. This processed soy milk contains appreciable levels of vitamin A, B vitamins, and vitamin D in a range of 10 to 45% of the Daily Value, with calcium and magnesium also in significant content. It has a glycemic index of 34±4.\n\nSoy milk flavor quality differs according to the cultivar of soybean used in its production. Even in China, the desirable sensory qualities are a mouthfeel (smooth but thick), color (off-white), and appearance (creamy) resembling milk. These traits—along with a pleasing aroma—are positively correlated with a soy milk's content of proteins, soluble solids, and oil. In the United States, testing suggests consumers prefer viscous soy milk with sweet aromatic flavors like vanilla and actively dislike the \"beany\" or \"brothy\" flavors resembling traditional \"doujiang\".\n\nSoy milk is made from whole soybeans or full-fat soy flour. The dry beans are soaked in water for a minimum of three hours up to overnight depending on the temperature of the water. The rehydrated beans then undergo wet grinding with enough added water to give the desired solids content to the final product which has a protein content of 1–4%, depending on the method of production. The ratio of water to beans on a weight basis is 10:1 for traditional soy milk. The resulting slurry or purée is brought to a boil in order to improve its taste properties by heat inactivating soybean trypsin inhibitor, improve its flavor, and to sterilize the product. Heating at or near the boiling point is continued for a period of time, 15–20 minutes, followed by the removal of insoluble residues (soy pulp fiber) by filtration. Processing requires the use of an anti-foaming agent or natural defoamer during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soy milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming. It is generally opaque, white or off-white in color, and approximately the same consistency as cow's milk. Quality attributes during preparation include germination time for the beans used, acidity, total protein and carbohydrates, phytic acid content, and viscosity.\n\nSoy milk is a common beverage in East Asian cuisines. In Chinese cuisine, \"sweet\" soy milk is made by adding cane sugar or simple syrup. \"Salty\" or \"savory\" soy milk is often combined with chopped pickled mustard greens, dried shrimp, youtiao croutons, chopped spring onions, cilantro, pork floss, and/or shallots, along with vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and/or chili oil. Both are traditional breakfast foods, served hot or cold depending on the season or personal preference. At breakfast, it is often accompanied by starchy carbohydrate-rich foods like mantou (a thick, fluffy kind of roll or bun), youtiao (deep-fried dough sticks), and shaobing (sesame flatbread).\n\nJapanese cuisine uses soy milk to make yuba and as an occasional base for nabemono.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, soy milk is used as the broth for making kongguksu, a cold noodle soup eaten mostly in summer.\n\nIn the west, soy milk is found in many vegan and vegetarian food products and can be used as a replacement for cow's milk in many recipes. Soy milk is also used in making imitation dairy products such as soy yogurt, soy cream, soy kefir and soy-based cheese analogues.\n\nUsing soybeans to make milk instead of raising cows may be ecologically advantageous. Cows require much more energy in order to produce milk, since the farmer must feed the animal, which can consume up to of food in dry matter basis and of water a day, producing an average of of milk a day. Legumes, including the soybean plant, also replenish the nitrogen content of the soil in which they are grown.\n\nThe cultivation of soybeans in South America is a cause of deforestation (specifically in the Amazon rainforest) and a range of other large-scale environmental harm. However, the majority of soybean cultivation worldwide, especially in South America where cattle farming is widespread, is intended for livestock fodder rather than soy milk production.\n\n"}

It is known globally in its British Indian form as a staple of curry house and Indian restaurant menus, often regarded as a fiery, spicy dish, even though it may not necessarily be the spiciest dish available.\n\nA standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese \"carne de vinha d'alhos\" (literally \"meat in garlic wine marinade\"), a vindaloo is a dish of meat (usually pork) marinated in wine and garlic. The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the Portuguese sailor's \"preserved\" raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of alternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in red wine. This was \"Indianized\" by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the red wine, and the addition of dried red chili peppers with additional spices. It evolved into the localized and easy-to-pronounce dish \"vindaloo\". \n\nNowadays, the British Indian version of vindaloo calls for the meat to be marinated in vinegar, sugar, fresh ginger and spices overnight, then cooked with the addition of more spices.\n\nRestaurants in Goa offering traditional Goan cuisine serve vindaloo with pork, which is the original recipe. The dish was popularized by Goan cooks (whom the British favoured, because they had no issues in kitchens and bars when handling beef, goat meat, pork, or liquor) in the British establishments and the ocean-going liners. Restaurants outside Goa serve vindaloo with chicken or lamb, which is sometimes mixed with cubed potatoes. Even though the word \"aloo\" (आलू) means \"potato\" in Hindi, traditional vindaloo does \"not\" include potatoes.\n\nVindaloo has gained popularity outside of India, where it is almost universally featured on menus at Indian restaurants. Vindaloo served in restaurants of the United Kingdom differs from the original vindaloo dish; it is simply a spicier version of the standard \"medium (spiciness)\" restaurant curry with the addition of vinegar, potatoes and chili peppers. The British variation originated from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 1970s.\n\nVindaloo is one of the spiciest dishes available on menus where it is served, although some restaurants serve a \"tindaloo\", which is a quite different dish that originated in Bangladesh.\n\n"}

Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.\n\nFugu is served as sashimi and chirinabe. Some consider the liver to be the tastiest part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984. Fugu has become one of the most celebrated and notorious dishes in Japanese cuisine.\n\nFugu contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, the ovaries, eyes, and skin. The poison, a sodium channel blocker, paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious; the poisoned victim is unable to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation. There is no known antidote for fugu poison. The standard treatment is to support the respiratory and circulatory systems until the poison is metabolized and excreted by the victim's body.\n\nResearchers have determined that a fugu's tetrodotoxin comes from eating other animals infested with tetrodotoxin-laden bacteria, to which the fish develops insensitivity over time. As such, efforts have been made in research and aquaculture to allow farmers to produce safe fugu. Farmers now produce 'poison-free' fugu by keeping the fish away from the bacteria; Usuki, a town in Ōita Prefecture, has become known for selling non-poisonous fugu.\n\nThe inhabitants of Japan have eaten fugu for centuries. Fugu bones have been found in several shell middens, called \"kaizuka\", from the Jōmon period that date back more than 2,300 years. The Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868) prohibited the consumption of fugu in Edo and its area of influence. It became common again as the power of the Shōgunate weakened. In western regions of Japan, where the government's influence was weaker and fugu was easier to get, various cooking methods were developed to safely eat them. During the Meiji Era (1867–1912), fugu was again banned in many areas. Fugu is the only food the Emperor of Japan is forbidden by law to eat, for his safety.\n\nIn China, the use of the pufferfish for culinary purposes was already well established by the Song dynasty as one of the 'three delicacies of the Yangtze' (長江三鮮) and appears in the writings of the polymath Shen Kuo as well as in the encyclopedic work \"Taiping Guangji\". The scholar-statesman Su Shi famously remarked that the taste is worthy of death (值那一死).\n\nThe \"torafugu\", or tiger pufferfish (\"Takifugu rubripes\"), is the most prestigious edible species and the most poisonous. Other species are also eaten; for example, \"Higanfugu\" (\"T. pardalis\"), \"Shōsaifugu\" (\"T. vermicularis\" syn. \"snyderi\"), and \"Mafugu\" (\"T. porphyreus\"). The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan provides a list that shows which species' body parts can be consumed. The list names safe genera including pufferfish of the \"Lagocephalus\" and \"Sphoeroides\" genera and the related porcupinefish (\"Harisenbon\") of the family \"Diodontidae\".\n\nStrict fishing regulations are now in place to protect fugu populations from depletion. Most fugu is now harvested in the spring during the spawning season and then farmed in floating cages in the Pacific Ocean. The largest wholesale fugu market in Japan is in Shimonoseki.\n\nFugu prices rise in autumn and peak in winter, the best season, because they fatten to survive the cold. Live fish arrive at a restaurant, surviving in a large tank, usually prominently displayed. Prepared fugu is also often available in grocery stores, which must display official license documents. Whole fish may not be sold to the general public.\n\nSince 1958, fugu chefs must earn a license to prepare and sell fugu to the public. This involves a two- or three-year apprenticeship. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test, preparing and eating the fish. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass. Small miscalculations result in failure or, in rare cases, death. Consumers believe that this training process makes it safer to eat fugu in restaurants or markets. Also, commercially available fugu is sometimes grown in environments in which it grows to be less toxic.\n\nSince October 2012, restaurants in Japan have been permitted to sell fugu which has been prepared and packaged by a licensed practitioner elsewhere.\n\nA dish of fugu typically costs between ¥2,000 (approx. US$20) and ¥5,000 (approx. US$50); a full-course fugu meal (usually eight servings) can cost ¥10,000–20,000 (approx. US$100–200). The expense encourages chefs to slice the fish very carefully to obtain the largest possible amount of meat. The special knife, called \"fugu hiki\", is usually stored separately from other knives.\n\nTetrodotoxin (TTX) is a natural product that has, as of 2015, been isolated from puffer fish, but also from octopuses, from crabs and shellfish, from frogs and newts, as well as other aquatic animals (see below). It is a potent neurotoxin that shuts down electrical signaling in nerves; it acts via interaction with components of the sodium channels in the cell membranes of those cells. It does not cross the blood–brain barrier. In the case of the pufferfish host, at least (see below), their insusceptibility to the poison results from a mutation in their sequence of their specific types of sodium channel proteins.\n\nTTX is not produced by puffer fish and the other aquatic animals from which it has been isolated; rather, bacteria such as \n\"Alteromonas\", \"Shewanella\", and \"Vibrio\" species infect or cohabit with the animal species from which TTX is isolated, and a bacterial biosynthetic pathway for its production has been rationalized.\n\nIn animal studies with mice, the median lethal dose of TTX was found to be 232 µg per kg body weight. Tetrodotoxin levels are affected by preparation (removal of most toxic materials, treatments such as curing and pickling, see below); it is, however, reportedly not significantly affected by cooking.\n\nThe symptoms from ingesting a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin may include dizziness, exhaustion, headache, nausea, or difficulty breathing. The person remains conscious but cannot speak or move. Breathing stops and asphyxiation follows.\n\nThere is no known antidote, and treatment consists of emptying the stomach, giving the person activated charcoal to bind the toxin, and putting them on life support until the poison has worn off. Toxicologists have been working on developing an antidote for tetrodotoxin.\n\nStatistics from the Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health indicate 20 to 44 incidents, some affecting multiple diners, of \"fugu\" poisoning per year between 1996 and 2006 in Japan. Between 34 and 64 people were hospitalized, and zero to six died, per year, with an average fatality rate of 6.8%. Of the 23 incidents reported in Tokyo from 1993 through 2006, only one took place in a restaurant; all others involved people catching and eating the fish. Poisonings through amateur preparation can result from confusion between types of puffer, as well as improper methods, and some may represent deliberate suicide attempts. Engelbert Kaempfer, a German physician who resided in Japan in the 1690s, reported that an unusually toxic variety of puffer was sometimes sought out by individuals who wished to take their own lives.\n\nMuch higher figures were reported in earlier years, peaking in 1958 when 176 people died from eating fugu in a single year. According to the Fugu Research Institute 50% of the victims were poisoned by eating the liver, 43% from eating the ovaries, and 7% from eating the skin. One of the most famous victims was the Kabuki actor and \"Living National Treasure\" Bandō Mitsugorō VIII, who in 1975 died after eating four servings of \"fugu kimo\" (fugu liver), the sale of which was prohibited by local ordinances at the time. Bandō claimed to be able to resist the poison, but died several hours after returning to his hotel.\n\nOn August 23, 2007, a doctor in Thailand reported that unscrupulous fish sellers sold puffer meat disguised as salmon, which caused fifteen deaths over three years. About 115 people were taken to different hospitals. Fugu had been banned in Thailand five years prior to the deaths.\n\nIn March 2008, a fisherman in the Philippines died and members of his family became ill from pufferfish. The previous year, four people in the same town died and five others had fallen ill after eating the same variety of pufferfish.\n\nIn February 2009, a Malaysian fisherman died and four others were hospitalised after they consumed a meal of puffer fish when they ran out of food while at sea.\n\nIn November 2011, a chef at two-Michelin star \"Fugu Fukuji\" in Tokyo was suspended from his post. The chef served fugu liver to a customer who, despite being warned of the risks, specifically asked that it be provided. The 35-year-old customer subsequently required hospital treatment for mild symptoms of tetrodotoxin paralysis, but made a full recovery.\n\nFive men were poisoned at a restaurant in Wakayama in March 2015 after specifically asking for liver.\n\n\nIn the cuisine of Hakusan, Ishikawa, ovaries are served after effort is made to reduce the toxin level by salting and pickling for three years—e.g., in \"Blowfish Ovaries Pickled in Rice-Bran Paste\" (河豚の卵巣の糠漬け, ふぐのらんそうのぬかづけ). Only the \"Mikawa district of Hakusan City, the Ono and Kanaiwa districts of Kanazawa City, and Wajima City, all in Ishikawa Prefecture\" are permitted to perform the process, and only by the traditional method, and explicit warnings are offered to dissuade non-professionals from attempting the 3-year process. After one year of pickling—about a third of the way through the process—about 10% of the toxin is suggested to remain, and after the full three years the product is \"only sold after having been checked for safety through a toxicity inspection, and other tests.\"\n\nIn Korean cuisine, edible pufferfish are prepared in various ways including \"gui\" (grilling), \"jorim\" (simmering), and \"guk\" (soup).\n\nMost Japanese cities have one or more fugu restaurants, perhaps in clusters because of earlier restrictions, as proximity made it easier to ensure freshness. A famous restaurant specializing in fugu is \"Takefuku\", in the Ginza district in Tokyo. \"Zuboraya\" is another popular chain in Osaka.\n\nIn South Korea, fugu is known as \"bok-eo\" (복어). It is very popular in port cities such as Busan and Incheon. It is prepared in a number of dishes such as soups and salads, and commands a high price.\n\nThe fugu is cleaned of the most toxic parts in Japan and freeze-flown to the USA under license in customized, clear, plastic containers. Fugu chefs for U.S. restaurants are trained under the same rigorous specifications as in Japan. Pufferfish native to US waters, particularly the genus \"Spheroides\", have also been consumed for food, sometimes resulting in poisonings.\n\nSale of fish belonging to this genus is forbidden altogether in the European Union.\n\nJapanese restaurateur Nobuyoshi Kuraoka waged a five-year battle with the Food and Drug Administration to allow exclusive import of the Japanese Puffer Tiger fish to his restaurant in Manhattan. License was granted in 1989. By 2003 only seventeen restaurants in the United States were licensed to serve fugu; twelve of those were in New York City including Kuraoka's Restaurant Nippon.\n\nIn the Kansai region, the slang word \"teppō\", () meaning rifle or gun, is used for the fish. This is a play of words on the verb \"ataru\" (), which can mean to be poisoned or shot. In Shimonoseki region, the ancient pronunciation \"fuku\" is more common instead of the modern \"fugu\". The former is also a homonym for \"good fortune\" whereas the latter is one for \"disabled.\"\nThe Tsukiji fish market fugu association holds a service each year at the height of the fugu season, releasing hundreds of caught fugu into the Sumida River. A similar ceremony is also held at another large market in Shimonoseki.\n\nA \"rakugo\", or humorous short story, tells of three men who prepared a fugu stew but were unsure whether it was safe to eat. To test the stew, they gave some to a beggar. When it did not seem to do him any harm, they ate the stew. Later, they met the beggar again and were delighted to see that he was still in good health. After that encounter, the beggar, who had hidden the stew instead of eating it, knew that it was safe and he could eat it. The three men had been fooled by the wise beggar.\n\nLanterns can be made from the bodies of preserved fugu. These are occasionally seen outside of fugu restaurants, as children's toys, as folk art, or as souvenirs. Fugu skin is also made into everyday objects like wallets or waterproof boxes.\n\nScientists at Nagasaki University have reportedly succeeded in creating a non-toxic variety of torafugu by restricting the fish's diet. After raising over 4,800 non-toxic fish, they are fairly certain that the fish's diet and digestive process actually produce the toxins. The non-toxic version is said to taste the same. Some skeptics say that the fish being offered as non-toxic may be of a different species, and that the toxicity has nothing to do with the diet of the pufferfish.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite the name, the drink contains neither eggs nor cream.\n\nThe egg cream is almost exclusively a fountain drink. Although there have been several attempts to bottle it, none has been wholly successful, as its fresh taste and characteristic head require mixing of the ingredients just before drinking.\n\nMost writing on the egg cream assumes that it originated among Eastern European Jewish immigrants in New York City. This has led to a variety of theories to explain the widely noted paradox that the New York City egg cream is made with neither eggs nor cream.\n\nStanley Auster, the grandson of the beverage's alleged inventor, has been quoted as saying that the origins of the name are lost in time. One commonly accepted origin is that \"egg\" is a corruption of the German word — also found in Yiddish, meaning \"genuine\" or \"real\" — and this was a \"good cream\".\n\nFood historian Andrew Smith writes: \"During the 1880s, a popular specialty was made with chocolate syrup, cream, and raw eggs mixed into soda water. In poorer neighborhoods, a less expensive version of this treat was created, called the Egg Cream (made without the eggs or cream).\"\n\nAnother explanation comes from reports that it grew out of a request for from someone, possibly the actor Boris Thomashefsky who had experienced a similar drink in Paris, which according to his heavy accent morphed the name into something like \"egg cream\", which then developed into the current term.\n\n\nIn Indonesia, a (literally, \"happy soda\"), comprising soda water, sweetened condensed milk, and grenadine.

{"id": "477471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477471", "title": "Gyūdon", "text": "Gyūdon\n\n, literally beef bowl, is a Japanese dish consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi (fish and seaweed stock), soy sauce and mirin (sweet rice wine). It sometimes also includes shirataki noodles, and is sometimes topped with a raw egg or a soft poached egg (onsen tamago). A very popular food in Japan, it is commonly served with beni shōga (pickled ginger), shichimi (ground chili pepper), and a side dish of miso soup. \"Gyū\" is the Chinese letter for cow, and \"don\" is short for \"donburi\", the Japanese word for \"bowl\".\n\nDue to the Meiji Restoration and subsequent westernization, western customs like eating beef were adopted and spread throughout Japan.\n\nGyūdon is considered to have come from Sukiyaki-don and the old dish gyūnabe, where thin slices of beef are cooked with vegetables in a pot, and at some point was put over rice and served in a bowl.\n\nIn 1862, the Kantō region's version of gyūnabe became the first popular version of this dish. In 1899 Eikichi Matsuda opened the first Yoshinoya restaurant, at the fish market in Tokyo's Nihonbashi district.\n\nFrom the Taishō era (1912~) until the early Shōwa era (1926~), the use of cheap beef and the popularity of food sold from carts outdoors (yatai) in places like Asakusa boosted the popularity of the dish.\n\nAlthough traces of the traditional sukiyaki can be found in some gyūdon containing ingredients such as konjac, grilled tofu, and green onions, most major food chains serve it as beef with onion.\n\nGyūdon can be found in many restaurants in Japan and some fast food chains specialize exclusively in the dish. The largest gyūdon chain in Japan is Sukiya. Other large chains are Yoshinoya and Matsuya. Matsuya sells gyūdon under the name \"gyūmeshi\" (牛めし).\n\nSome gyūdon chains charge for miso soup, but many of them serve complimentary miso soup for customers who are eating in. The major gyūdon restaurant chain that offers free miso soup is Matsuya, whereas other major chains like Sukiya offer it as a part of a set or combo.\n\nThere are chains that allow customers to specify how their gyūdon is served with code phrases like \"tsuyudaku\" (extra tsuyu broth) at no extra charge. However, this service is only for people eating in confines of the restaurant.\n\n\"Tsuyudaku\", in regards to gyūdon, is jargon that refers to one kind of specification where the juice and tsuyu mixture is served in large amounts. \"Tsuyunuki\" is where the amount of tsuyu is specified to be less than usual. Also, the term \"tsuyudakudaku\" is code for a larger amount of tsuyu.\n\nSometimes, as with \"tsuyudakudakudaku\" (\"dripping with soupiness\"), people will request that the daku, or amount of tsuyu, be exceedingly increased.\n\nThere's a theory that says daku comes from the taku part of \"takusan\" (eng: many / a lot) which, when doubled as in \"daku-daku\", is also the onomatopoeia (imitative word) for the sound of dripping.\n\nThe origin of tsuyudaku comes from Japanese businessmen (salaryman) on their morning commute to work who, due to time restrictions, ask for extra soupy gyūdon (\"gyūdon tsuyu ome ni\") so that they can eat it quickly. \n\nThis trend became so common, that the term \"tsuyudaku\" quickly spread among proprietors of popular gyūdon chains.\n\nAs a consequence of the fear of mad cow disease and a ban on imports of beef from the United States, Yoshinoya and most competitors were forced to terminate gyūdon sales in Japan on February 11, 2004. Yoshinoya moved its business to a similar dish made with pork instead of beef, which it named \"butadon\" (豚丼). Sukiya continued to serve gyūdon (using Australian beef) and also added a dish, \"tondon\", equivalent to Yoshinoya's \"butadon\", to its menu. (\"Buta\" and \"ton\" are both Japanese words for \"pig\" or \"pork\", written with the same Han character, 豚. See tonkatsu, tonjiru.)\n\nThe Japanese Diet voted to resume beef imports from the United States in early May 2005, but the ban was reinstated in January 2006 after detectable quantities of prohibited spine tissue were found in the first post-ban shipments arriving in Japan. As the issue was discussed between the United States and Japanese governments, gyūdon vendors and customers waited for a resolution. As of September 2006, the ban has been lifted.\n\n\n"}

Fast food restaurants usually fry their nuggets in vegetable oil.\n\nSome fast food restaurants have launched vegetarian alternatives. McDonald's served Garden McNuggets made of beans and Swedish fast food restaurant Max Hamburgare offers a dish containing nuggets made of falafel. Quorn also supplies vegetarian chicken style nuggets.\n\nThe chicken nugget was invented in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented academic work. This bite sized piece of chicken, coated in batter and then deep fried was called the \"Chicken Crispie\" by Baker and his associates. Dr. Baker's innovations made it possible to form chicken nuggets in any shape. Common problems the meat industry were facing at the time of this invention were being able to hold ground meat together without a skin and producing a batter that could handle being both deep fried and frozen without coming off of the desired meat. Baker was able to solve both problems by first coating the meat in vinegar, salt, grains, and milk powder to make it hold together and secondly using an egg and grain based batter that was able to be fried as well as frozen.\n\nThe McDonald's version of Chicken Nuggets are known as Chicken McNuggets. Their recipe was created on commission from McDonald's by Tyson Foods in 1979 and the product was sold beginning in 1980.\n\nChicken nuggets are generally regarded as a fatty, unhealthy food. A study published in the \"American Journal of Medicine\" analyzed the composition of chicken nuggets from two different American fast food chains. The study found that less than half of the material was skeletal muscle with fat occurring in equal or greater quantities. Other components included epithelial tissue, bone, nervous tissue and connective tissue. The authors concluded that \"Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer.\"\n\nThe process of turning chickens into chicken nuggets occurs in three main sections. The first two, \"pre-slaughter\" and \"slaughter\", are common to the creation of many chicken products. The further processing required for making chicken nuggets begins with deboning. The chicken is cut and shaped to the correct size. This is done manually, by a series of automatic blades, or by a process called \"grinding\" (a method of deboning in which the softer parts of the chicken carcass are forced through a mesh, leaving behind the more solid pieces, resulting in a meat paste. If used, this paste is then shaped before battering). The pieces are battered and breaded in a large cylindrical drum that rotates, evenly coating all of the pieces in the desired spices and breading. The pieces are then fried in oil until the batter has set and the outside reaches the desired color. Finally the nuggets are packaged, frozen and stored for shipping. While specific ingredients and production methods may vary between manufacturers, the above practices hold true for most of the industry.\n\nChicken nuggets have been the subject of food challenges, social media phenomena, and many more forms of public notoriety. The dish has inspired gourmet restaurants, exercise routines, and even feature-length productions, including Cooties (film), a movie about a grade school child who eats a chicken nugget infected with a virus that turns pre-pubescent children into zombies. Thomas Welborn holds the world record for eating the most chicken nuggets in 3 minutes (746 grams, or approximately 42 chicken nuggets).\n\nThe most retweeted tweet of 2017 was made by Carter Wilkerson who asked Wendy's what it would take for a year of free nuggets. The tweet generated over 3.5 million retweets.\n\nThe largest recorded chicken nugget weighed and was long and wide and was created by Empire Kosher. It was unveiled at Kosherfest in Secaucus, New Jersey on October 29, 2013.\n\n"}

It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish in South Korea where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.\n\nBulgogi came from the Korean word \"bul-gogi\" (), consisting of \"bul\" (\"fire\") and \"gogi\" (\"meat\"). The compound word is derived from the Pyongan dialect, as the dish itself is a delicacy of Pyongan Province (currently in North Korea). After the liberation of the Korean Peninsula from Japanese forced occupation in 1945, the dish became popular in Seoul and other parts of South Korea, by refugees from Pyongan. It was then listed in the 1947 edition of the \"Dictionary of the Korean Language\", as meat grilled directly over a charcoal fire.\n\nIn the \"Standard Korean Language Dictionary\" published by the National Institute of Korean Language, the word is listed as meat such as beef that is thinly sliced, marinated, and grilled over the fire. The word is also included in English-language dictionaries such as \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English\". Merriam-Webster dated the word's appearance in the American English lexicon at 1961.\n\nBulgogi is believed to have originated during the Goguryeo era (37 BCE–668 CE), when it was originally called \"maekjeok\" (, ), with the beef being grilled on a skewer. It was called \"neobiani\" (너비아니), meaning \"thinly spread\" meat, during the Joseon Dynasty and was traditionally prepared especially for the wealthy and the nobility. In the medieval Korean history book \"Donggooksesi\" (동국세시), bulgogi is recorded under the name \"yeomjeok\" (염적), which means 'fire meat'. It was grilled barbecue-style on a \"hwaro\" grill on skewers, in pieces approximately 0.5 cm thick. Although it is no longer cooked skewered, this original type of bulgogi is today called \"bulgogi sanjeok\" (불고기 산적).\n\nBulgogi is made from thin slices of sirloin or other prime cuts of beef. Before cooking, the meat is marinated to enhance its flavor and tenderness with a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ground black pepper, and other ingredients such as scallions, ginger, onions or mushrooms, especially white button mushrooms or \"matsutake\". Pureed pears and onions are often used as tenderizers. Sometimes, cellophane noodles are added to the dish, which varies by the region and specific recipe.\n\nBulgogi is traditionally grilled, but pan-cooking has become popular as well. Whole cloves of garlic, sliced onions and chopped green peppers are often grilled or fried with the meat. This dish is sometimes served with a side of lettuce or other leafy vegetable, which is used to wrap a slice of cooked meat, often along with a dab of \"ssamjang\", or other side dishes, and then eaten together.\n\nBulgogi is served in barbecue restaurants in Korea, and there are bulgogi-flavoured fast-food hamburgers sold at many South Korean fast-food restaurants. The hamburger patty is marinated in bulgogi sauce and served with lettuce, tomato, onion, and sometimes cheese.\n\n\n\n"}

Thali is also used to refer to an Indian-style meal made up of a selection of various dishes which are served on a platter. The 'thali' style meal serving is popular in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nAs noted by INTACH, the earliest evidence of use of continuity in cooking and food habits of India can be established by the existence of tandoor (cooking oven), thali, lotas and chakla-belan for making chapatis found in excavations at Indus Valley Civilization site of Kalibangan (3500 BCE – 2500 BCE).\n\n\"Thali\" refers to the metal plate that a thali meal may be served on. Thali is popular in Punjab The idea behind a Thali is to offer all the 6 different flavors of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavors). According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these 6 flavors. Restaurants typically offer a choice of vegetarian or meat-based thalis. Vegetarian thalis are very typical and commonplace in Tamil Nadu canteens (and South India and Southeast Asia in general), and are a popular lunch choice.\n\nDishes served in a Thali vary from region to region in South Asia and are usually served in small bowls, called \"katori\" in India. These 'katoris' are placed along the edge of the round tray – the actual thali: sometimes a steel tray with multiple compartments is used. Typical dishes include rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, dahi (yogurt), small amounts of chutney or pickle, and a sweet dish to top it off. Rice or Roti is the usual main dish which occupies the central portion of the Thali, while the side dishes like vegetable curries and other aforementioned delicacies are lined circularly along the round Thali. Depending on the restaurant or the region, the thali consists of delicacies native to that region. In general, a thali begins with different types of breads such as puris or chapatis (rotis) and different vegetarian specialities (curries). However, in South India, rice is the only staple served with thalis. Thalis are sometimes referred to by the regional characteristic of the dishes they contain. For example, one may encounter Nepalese thali, Rajasthani thali, Gujarati thali and Maharashtrian thali. In many parts of India and Nepal, the bread and the rice portions are not served together in the thali. Typically, the bread is offered first with rice being served afterwards, often in a separate bowl or dish.\n\nUnlimited thalis are those that come with limitless refills.

The dish was first popularized in New York City. \n\nThere are conflicting accounts as to the origin of Eggs Benedict.\n\nDelmonico's in lower Manhattan says on its menu that \"Eggs Benedict was first created in our ovens in 1860.\" One of its former chefs, Charles Ranhofer, also published the recipe for \"Eggs à la Benedick\" in 1894.\n\nIn an interview recorded in the \"Talk of the Town\" column of \"The New Yorker\" in 1942, the year before his death, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon, and a hooker of hollandaise\". Oscar Tschirky, the \"maître d'hôtel\", was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham for the bacon and a toasted English muffin for the toast.\n\nA later claim to the creation of Eggs Benedict was circuitously made by Edward P. Montgomery on behalf of Commodore E. C. Benedict. In 1967 Montgomery wrote a letter to then \"The New York Times\" food columnist Craig Claiborne which included a recipe he said he had received through his uncle, a friend of the commodore. Commodore Benedict's recipe—by way of Montgomery—varies greatly from Ranhofer's version, particularly in the hollandaise sauce preparation—calling for the addition of a \"hot, hard-cooked egg and ham mixture\".\n\nSeveral variations of Eggs Benedict exist\n\n"}

It is heavily used in the Bahia state of Brazil. It apparently got its name from the unrelated melegueta pepper (a seed-derived spice) from West Africa, because of a similar level of piquancy (spiciness or hotness of flavor). \n\nIt is a small, tapered, green chili that turns red as it matures, at about 5 cm (2 in) in length. It has a range of 60,000 to 100,000 Scoville units. Two sizes are seen in markets, which sometimes have different names: the smaller ones are called ' in Brazil, and as (a Swahili name) in Mozambique and in Portugal, though this name is now also used for a newer, derived African cultivar, the pepper), while the larger ones are called ' in both Brazil and Portugal. They are not different varieties, just peppers of different maturities from the same plant. In Portugal, it is sometimes simply referred to as or , though other varieties are available in modern markets today. It is also known in Angola by the names of \"jindungo\", \"ndongo\", \"nedungo\", and \"pripíri\" in various local languages. In Cape Verde, malagueta is called and in the Criola language.\n\nThe first Europeans to have contact with this species were the crew members who accompanied Christopher Columbus when they first landed in the Caribbean in 1492. In addition to being a noble delicacy much appreciated by the ancient inhabitants of the Americas, it was also used as a natural dye and, above all, as a medicine.\n\nThe spicy capsaicin content of the chilis must have aroused the interest of Portuguese, who for decades have been looking for easier sources for the then-rare black pepper of Asia (the piquant compound in which is piperine); one of the major motivations for the Columbian voyages was to discover a new route to Asia for direct trade in spices, silks, and other Asian goods. At the time of Columbus's arrival in the New World, the Portuguese traded from the Gulf of Guinea a very popular African spice as a substitute for the black pepper: \"Aframomum melegueta\" (today in disuse in the West, but known as grains of paradise), which was then best known as melegueta pepper. The name was applied to the local chilis, as , because the chili's piquancy was reminiscent of Old World pepper. (Today, various botanical and culinary writers continue to confuse malagueta chilis and melegueta pepper.)\n\nIn the period of intense exchanges and trips, named today the Columbian exchange, between Europe and the Americas, Portuguese navigators took this new \"malagueta\" to Portugal and to Brazil, where it became known as , , or ; to Africa where it became very popular as \"jindungo\" and \"piri-piri\"; and eventually took it to Asia, where it became an ingredient of curries and other spicy dishes. Less than a century after being brought to Europe, chili pepper, because of its qualities, spread to many other Old World cultures, including Arabia, India, Thailand, China, and surrounding regions, integrating with local cuisines.\n\nThis pepper is used to season many regional dishes and sauces in Brazil and Mozambique. In Portugal, it is mainly used to season poultry dishes.\n\nIn Brazil, what is now being sold as malagueta may well be a recent hybrid, while what is now referred to as , , may well be the original malagueta, and was actually the only malagueta on the market 30 years ago. While there have been claims that , , and are other names for malagueta, these are quite different and they appear to belong in the \"Capsicum chinense\" species. \n\nIn the cuisine of São Tomé and Príncipe, \"piri-piri\" sauce made with malagueta peppers is commonly available as a condiment in restaurants throughout São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, malagueta with allspice to make a preparation called .\n\nMalaguest chilis were featured in \"Woman on Top\", a 2000 American fantasy and romantic comedy film directed by Fina Torres and starring Penélope Cruz, in which Cruz's character, Isabella, creates enchanting Afro-Brazilian dishes for a television cooking show, and the show's producer, played by Mark Feuerstein, keys in on the pepper's spicy allure and Isabella's sensuality. The film's promotional material features Cruz holding a pepper; however, the malagueta is replaced by another, larger chili.\n\n"}

A mayonnaise-based recipe is documented in 1914.\n\nLocal historians claim that the mayonnaise-based version was invented in Nashua, New Hampshire, by James E. Colburn in the 1910s. A 1927 biographical article calls him \"the originator and first producer of that delectable condiment known as Russian salad dressing\". Colburn had been selling \"Colburn's Mayonnaise salad dressing\" at his store since at least 1910.\n\nCertainly by 1914, Colburn's company was manufacturing it, and distributing it to retailers and hotels. He earned enough from its sale that he retired in 1924.\n\nIt is unknown in traditional Russian cuisine, but Russians call it \"ketchunnaise\" (кетчунез).\n\nTypically piquant, it is today characteristically made of a blend of mayonnaise and ketchup complemented with such additional ingredients as horseradish, pimentos, chives, and spices.\n\nBesides being used as a salad dressing, Russian dressing is also used as a sandwich spread for Reuben sandwiches.\n\nRussian dressing has largely been supplanted by Thousand Island dressing, which is sweeter and less spicy than Russian.\n\nOther combinations of mayonnaise and ketchup, but without the spicy ingredients, are known as fry sauce or other names, and typically served with french fries or tostones.\n\nTartar sauce has the piquant ingredients of Russian dressing, without the ketchup.

Hot Dry Noodles has a history in Chinese food culture for 80 years, and it is unique because the noodles are not in soup like most other Asian style noodles. \nIt is the most significant, famous and popular breakfast food in Wuhan, often sold in street carts and restaurants in residential and business areas.\nBreakfasts such as Hot dry noodles are available from as early as 5 am, and usually appears on night markets as a snack during late night times in Wuhan. The noodle could be prepared in minutes and affordable, therefore it becomes the most popular breakfast choice.\n\nHot dry noodles restaurants stand all over the city. Typical hot dry noodles contain soy sauce, sesame paste, pickled vegetables, chopped garlic chives and chili oil. Hot dry noodles, along with Shanxi's knife-cut noodles (刀削面: Daoxiaomian), Liangguang's \"yifumian\", Sichuan's \"dandanmian\", and northern China's \"zhajiangmian\", are collectively referred to \"Top five noodles of China\" by People's Daily, and rated No.1 in the list titled in \"China's Top 10 famous noodles\" by Business Insider in 2013 The specifics of the preparation of hot dry noodles is discussed in Wuhan author Chi Li's novel '热也好冷也好活着就好'.\n\nThe recipe for hot dry noodles is different from cold noodles and noodles in soup.\n\nBoth Wuhan and Szechuan cuisine make extensive use of chilies to cleanse the palate and cope with the humid climate. The chef will cook the fresh noodles mixed with sesame oil in boiling water. When the noodles get cooked and cooled down, it becomes pliable. Before eating, the noodles will be cooked in the same process again. Finally, dressings including spring onion and sauce will be added. While preparing hot dry noodles, the noodles are placed into a Chinese strainer (a cone-shaped strainer) and dipped briefly into boiling water and then swirled and drained. The noodles will be poured into a paper bowl and the sauce and pickled vegetables will be poured on the top of the noodles. Chili oil is usually used in the seasoning of hot dry noodles as well as a bit of fresh coriander.\n\nThe summer time in Wuhan is extremely long, and the high temperature causes food's rapid deterioration. As a result, people added dietary alkali into noodles to avoid deterioration, that is the predecessor of hot dry noodles.\n\nA widely circulated rumor is, in the early 1930s, there was a small food stand operated by Bao Li, a hawker who made a living by selling bean noodles and noodle soups near a temple in Hankou. One day, Li poured sesame oil onto his noodles accidentally, and he boiled those noodles then added shallot and other condiments on the next day and sold them on next morning. His noodles became very popular because of its unique taste, and customers asked Bao Li what kind of noodle it is, Bao Li answered: Hot dry noodles.\n\nIt is difficult to find hot dry noodles outside of Wuhan.\nNevertheless, during the development and spread of the making technique, people in Xinyang, a city in Henan Province, formed their own special way to make hot dry noodles and it became a branch of hot dry noodles eventually.\n\n"}

Pie, mash and eel shops have been in London since the 19th century, and are still common in East and South London and in many parts of Kent and Essex. The shops may serve stewed or jellied eels.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, industrial air pollution tended to be worse in the east and south east of London because of the prevailing westerly wind, with the result that the East End was settled more by the working classes, while the western part of the city was home to higher social classes. The working class were poor and favoured foodstuffs that were cheap, in plentiful supply and easy to prepare.\n\nThe savoury pie had long been a traditional food, and its small handsized form also made it a transportable meal, protected from dirt by its cold pastry crust, and filled with cheap minced meat, usually mutton. Adding cheap mashed potatoes, together with a sauce made with fish stock and parsley, made it a plate-based sit-down meal.\n\nJellied eels are often associated with pie and mash, as European eels cooked in gelatine also became a common worker's meal since eels were one of the few forms of fish that could survive in the heavily polluted River Thames and London's other rivers at that time. Supply was plentiful through the late 19th century, particularly from the Dutch fishing boats landing catches at Billingsgate Fish Market. \n\nSince 2010, as revealed in a joint study by the Zoological Society of London and the Environment Agency, the number of eels captured in research traps in the River Thames fell from 1,500 in 2005 to 50 in 2010, meaning most eels used in pie and mash shops are now from the Netherlands and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe main dish sold is pie and mash, a minced-mutton and cold-water-pastry pie served with mashed potato. There should be two types of pastry used; the bottom or base should be suet pastry and the top can be rough puff or short. It is common for the mashed potato to be spread around one side of the plate and for a type of parsley sauce to be present. This is commonly called eel liquor sauce or simply liquor (although it is non-alcoholic), traditionally made using the water kept from the preparation of the stewed eels. However, many shops no longer use stewed eel water in their parsley liquor. The sauce traditionally has a green colour, from the parsley.\n\nBefore shops became common, trading took place from braziers or carts. It was not until late Victorian times that shops began to appear. The first recorded shop was Henry Blanchard's at 101 Union Street in Southwark in 1844 which was described as an \"Eel Pie House\". The shops have become part of the local community and heritage of their area, for example, L. Manze in Walthamstow became Grade II listed by English Heritage in 2013 due to its architectural and cultural significance.\n\nTraditionally, pie and mash shops have white tile walls with mirrors, and marble floors, tables and work tops, all of which are easy to clean. They give the shops, hardly ever called restaurants, a late Victorian or Art Deco appearance. \n\nBecause of the large number of pleasure boat steamer companies offering Sunday trips on the River Thames, many Eastenders used them to explore the more gentrified west of London. The result was that many also wanted their traditional foods of ale and pie and mash, resulting in the renaming of both a hotel that they frequently visited and the island on which it sat in Twickenham to Eel Pie Island in the early 1900s.\n\nMore Londoners are moving to the suburbs and England's rural counties are gaining in popularity. To cater for this exodus of Londoners, mail order pie and mash companies have set up and traditional pie mash and liquor can be delivered anywhere in the UK.\n\nJellied eels and cockles are other London specialities often sold in pie and mash shops, usually bought ready prepared from wholesalers. Chilli vinegar (vinegar containing pickled chilies), originating from the spice trade imports to the London docks, is also traditionally served with all these dishes. Prior to the introduction of chilies to the vinegar in recent years, the vinegar of choice was a plain malt vinegar like Sarsons. \nIn recent years, some pie and mash shops have started to offer a broader selection of pies, including vegetarian and chicken versions, to serve a broader range of customers. Fruit pies (sprinkled with sugar) were already available in many shops as a dessert.\n\n\n"}

The brand's best-known product is Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, an orange-flavored liqueur created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is made from a blend of Cognac brandy, distilled essence of bitter orange, and sugar. Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge is 40% alcohol (70 proof in UK, 80 proof in US).\n\nAside from Cordon Rouge, the Grand Marnier line includes other liqueurs, most of which can be consumed \"neat\" as a cordial or a digestif, and can be used in mixed drinks and desserts. In France, this kind of use is the most popular, especially with crêpes Suzette and crêpes au Grand Marnier.\n\nCésar Ritz (1850–1918) reportedly came up with the name \"Grand Marnier\" for Marnier-Lapostolle, who in return helped him purchase and establish the Hotel Ritz Paris. On March 15, 2016, the Campari Group announced a friendly takeover offer for Société des Produits Marnier Lapostolle S.A., the owner of Grand Marnier.\n\nCordon Rouge (\"Red Ribbon\") is an orange-flavored cognac liqueur and the original Grand Marnier liqueur, which was created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is consumed neat and is also used in mixed drinks and desserts.\n\n\n\nCordon Jaune (\"Yellow Ribbon\") was only sold in some European countries and at some major international airports. The production stopped on January 1, 2017. Cordon Jaune is a triple-sec Curaçao-like liqueur that is made with neutral grain spirit instead of Cognac. It does not resemble Cordon Rouge or other orange-flavored brandy liqueurs so much as other high-quality, 80 proof triple-sec Curaçao liqueurs, like Cointreau original or Gabriel Boudier Curaçao Triple-sec.\n\n\"Cuvée du Centenaire\" (\"Centennial Edition\") was first released in limited quantities in 1927 to commemorate the 100th anniversary. It is made with up to 25-year-old fine cognacs and is consumed neat. It is more expensive, at about US$145 per bottle.\n\n\nThe \"Cuvée Spéciale Cent Cinquantenaire\" (\"Special Sesquicentennial Edition\") was created in 1977 to honor the 150th anniversary of the brand, and is currently the most expensive variety of Grand Marnier. It is made with up to 50-year-old cognacs in frosted glass bottles featuring hand-painted Art Nouveau decorations. In 2005 it was marketed with the slogan \"Hard to find, impossible to pronounce, and prohibitively expensive.\"\n\n\nCuvée Louis-Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle is a special selection of cognacs taken from the best known districts (Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois and Bons Bois) and aged at length in oak casks. It is only available in duty-free shops in Canada and France and liquor stores in Quebec, Canada, and the Netherlands.\n\nGrand Marnier is used in several kinds of pastries, such as liquor cream buns. It can also be used in the French Christmas dessert known as \"Bûche de Noël\" (Yule log). It is frequently used in recipes for cranberry sauce, as sweetness and citrus can be a contrast to the bitterness of cranberries. It is also an ingredient for the preparation of flambé dishes, such as crêpes Suzette, Grand Marnier soufflé and crème brûlée. It can also be used in the sauce of the \"Canard à l'orange\" roasted duck dish. It can be simply drizzled over vanilla ice cream. It can also be used in some fruitcake recipes instead of brandy.\n\nGrand Marnier can be used in mixed drinks.

Milk and butter are frequently used in preparation and it is frequently whipped at the end. The dish is usually a side dish to meat and/or vegetables. The closely related smashed potatoes dish is made with unskinned potatoes and it is hand mashed and not whipped.\n\nRecipes for making the dish started appearing in 1747 with an entry in \"The Art of Cookery\" by Hannah Glasse. Dehydrated and frozen mashed potatoes are available in many supermarkets.\n\nMashed potato may be used as an intermediary ingredient for other dishes such as dumplings and gnocchi, in which case the potatoes may be baked or boiled, and may or may not have dairy or seasoning added.\n\nThe use of \"floury\" types of potatoes is recommended, although \"waxy\" potatoes are sometimes used for a different texture. There are a multitude of \"floury\" types, but the most commonly known include russet, golden wonder, and red rascal potatoes. Butter, vegetable oil, milk and/or cream are usually added to improve flavour and texture, and the potatoes are seasoned with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs and spices. Popular ingredients and seasonings include: garlic, cheese, bacon bits, sour cream, crisp onion or spring onion, caramelised onion, mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish, spices such as nutmeg, and chopped herbs such as parsley.\n\nOne French variation adds egg yolk for \"pommes duchesse\" or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed with butter and lightly browned. \"Pomme purée\" (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than normal mashed potato - up to one part butter for every two parts potato. In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth. \"Aloo Bharta\", an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves and other spices.\n\nMashed potato can be served as a side dish, and is often served with sausages in the British Isles, where they are known as bangers and mash. Mashed potato can be an ingredient of various other dishes, including shepherd's and cottage pie, pierogi, colcannon, dumplings, potato pancakes, potato croquettes and gnocchi. Particularly runny mashed potatoes are called \"mousseline\" potatoes.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the cold mashed potato is mixed with fresh eggs and then fried until crisp to produce the potato cake. This dish is thought to have originated in Cornwall and is a popular breakfast item. When instead combined with meat and other leftover vegetables, the fried dish is known as bubble and squeak.\n\nA popular accompaniment to mashed potatoes in the United States is gravy. The most common forms of gravy paired with mashed potatoes are beef gravy or turkey gravy, though vegetable gravy is becoming more common as the vegetarian and vegan trends see a rise in popularity.\n\nA potato masher is a utensil which can be used to prepare the potatoes, as is a potato ricer. They may also be whipped with an electric hand mixer, or with sufficient boiling, can be mashed effectively with a durable wooden spoon and brute force.\n"}

Historically, the dish has also been prepared using other meats, such as rump steak and lamb's kidney.\n\nBatter puddings became popular in the early 18th century. Jennifer Stead has drawn attention to a description of a recipe identical to 'toad in the hole' from the middle of the century. At this time, Northerners tended to use drippings to make their puddings crispier, whereas Southerners made softer Yorkshire puddings. \n\nDishes like toad in the hole appeared in print as early as 1762, where it was described as a 'vulgar' name for a 'small piece of beef baked in a large pudding'. Toad in the hole was originally created as a way to stretch out meat in poor households. Chefs therefore suggested using the cheapest meats in this dish. In 1747, for example, Hannah Glasse's \"The Art of Cookery\" listed a recipe for 'pigeon in a hole', calling for pigeon rather than the contemporary sausages. In 1861, Isabella Beeton listed a similar recipe using rump steak and lamb's kidney, while Charles Elme Francatelli's 1852 recipe mentions '6\"d\". or 1\"s\". worth of any kind of cheap meat. This recipe was described as 'English cooked-again stewed meat' (\"lesso rifatto all'inglese\") or 'toad in the Hole', in the first book of modern Italian cuisine, which stressed that meat was to be left-over from stews and re-cooked in batter.\n\nThe dish with leftover meat, was originally not called toad in the hole. In the 1787 book \"A Provincial Glossary\", for example, it was referred to as \"meat boiled in a crust\". The first mention of the word \"hole\", outside of \"Pigeons in a Hole\" found in the cookbook by Hannah Glasse, appeared in the 1900 publication \"Notes & Queries\", which described the dish as a \"batter-pudding with a hole in the middle containing meat\". Despite popular belief, there is no record of the dish ever being made with toad. The origin of the name is unclear, but it may refer to the way toads wait for their prey in their burrows, making their heads visible in the earth, just like the sausages peep through the batter. It may also derive from the \"Antediluvian Toad\", a phenomenon of live frogs or toads being found encased in stone, which was a scientific fad of the late 18th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "482611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=482611", "title": "Pork pie", "text": "Pork pie\n\nA pork pie is a traditional British meat pie, usually served cold. It consists of a filling of roughly chopped pork and pork fat, surrounded by a layer of jellied pork stock in a hot water crust pastry. It is normally eaten as a snack or with a salad.\n\nModern pork pies are a direct descendant of the raised meat pies of medieval cuisine, which used a dense hot water crust pastry as a simple means of preserving the filling. In France the same recipes gave rise to the modern \"Pâté en croute\". Many medieval meat pie recipes were sweetened, often with fruit, and were meant to be eaten cold: the crust was discarded rather than being eaten. A particularly elaborate and spectacular recipe described in medieval recipe collection \"The Forme of Cury\" was a meat pie featuring a crust formed into battlements and filled with sweet custards, the entire pie then being served flambeed: a distant descendant of this dish, with hollow pastry turrets around a central pork pie, was still current in the 18th century under the name \"battalia pie\". Hannah Glasse's influential 1747 recipe collection included a recipe for a \"Cheshire pork pie\", having a filling of layers of pork loin and apple, slightly sweetened with sugar, and filled with half a pint of white wine.\n\nBy the 19th century sweetened fruit and meat combinations had become less common, and the raised crust pork pie took its modern form.\n\nTraditional pies use a mix of fat and cured meat, giving the filling a pink colour. They are often produced in moulds or forms, giving the outside of the pie a very regular shape. This method is simpler and cheaper for volume production, and hence the more common choice for commercial manufacturers.\n\nAs the meat shrinks when the pie is cooked, traditional recipes specified that clarified butter or a hot pork stock was poured into the pie after baking. This would set when cool, filling the gap between meat and pastry and preventing air from reaching the filling and causing it to spoil. Commercial makers use a 6% solution of gelatin at between 80 and 90 degrees Celsius, added into the pie immediately after baking. \n\nThe Melton Mowbray pork pie is named after Melton Mowbray, a town in Leicestershire. While it is sometimes claimed that Melton pies became popular among fox hunters in the area in the late eighteenth century, it has also been stated that the association of the pork pie trade with Melton originated in c.1831 as a sideline in a small baker and confectioners' shop in the town, owned by Edward Adcock. Within the next decade a number of other bakers then started supplying them, notably Enoch Evans, a former grocer, who seems to have been particularly responsible for establishing the industry on a large scale. Whether true or not the association with hunting provided valuable publicity, although one local hunting columnist writing in 1872 stated that it was extremely unlikely that \"our aristocratic visitors carry lumps of pie with them on horseback\". \n\nThe main distinctive feature of a Melton pie is that it is made with a hand-formed crust. The uncured meat of a Melton pie is grey in colour when cooked; the meat is chopped, rather than minced. As the pies are baked free-standing, the sides bow outwards, rather than being vertical as with mould-baked pies.\n\nIn light of the premium price of the Melton Mowbray pie, the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association applied for protection under European Protected designation of origin laws as a result of the increasing production of Melton Mowbray-style pies by large commercial companies in factories far from Melton Mowbray, and recipes that deviated from the original uncured pork form. Protection was granted on 4 April 2008, with the result that only pies made within a designated zone around Melton, and using the traditional recipe including uncured pork, are allowed to carry the Melton Mowbray name on their packaging.\n\nThere is a tradition in the East Midlands of eating pork pies for breakfast at Christmas. While its origin is unclear, the association of pork pies with Christmas dates back to at least the mid 19th century and it was by far the busiest time of year for the Melton manufacturers. \n\nIn Yorkshire, pork pies are often served hot, accompanied with gravy or with mushy peas and mint sauce. For example, a van from award winning pie makers Wilson's of Cross Gates regularly serves the latter combination to supporters at Leeds Rhinos rugby league matches at Headingley Stadium. It is also a common combination served at Bonfire Night celebrations. In Yorkshire slang a pork pie is sometimes called a \"growler\", a term probably derived from the \"NAAFI growler\" of earlier naval and army slang.\n\nAn annual pork pie competition is held in April at The Old Bridge Inn, Ripponden, Yorkshire.\n\nThe gala pie is a variety of pork pie where the filling includes a proportion of chicken and a hard-boiled egg. Gala pies are often baked in long, loaf-type tins, with multiple eggs arranged along the centre. The so-called \"long egg\" in gala pies is actually made of several eggs. The yolks are separated from the whites and the yolks are then poured into a long tube-shaped mould in which they are cooked. The hard yolk is removed from the mould then put inside a larger tube-shaped mould and the egg whites are poured round the outside of the hard yolk. The whole thing is then cooked again to harden the whites around the yolk. This is then removed from the mould thus producing one very long hard-boiled egg.\n\nSmaller, , varieties, sometimes branded as a \"picnic pie\", often have additional ingredients added to the filling such as apples, pickles and bacon.\n\nIn some cases the solid pastry top is replaced by a pastry lattice, allowing the meat filling to be seen. A recent development is to have a layer of Branston pickle inserted under the lattice crust. Occasionally the top crust is dispensed with altogether in favour of a layer of cranberries sealed into place with aspic.\n\n"}
{"id": "482824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=482824", "title": "Turkish coffee", "text": "Turkish coffee\n\nTurkish coffee () is coffee prepared using very finely ground coffee beans, unfiltered. The same method is used in many Middle Eastern and Southeastern European countries.\n\nTurkish coffee refers to a method of brewing very finely ground coffee. Any coffee bean may be used; arabica varieties are considered best, but robusta or a blend is also used. The beans must be ground to a very fine powder, which is left in the coffee when served. The coffee may be ground at home in a manual grinder made for the very fine grind (home electric grinders are not suitable), ground to order by coffee merchants in most parts of the world, or bought ready-ground from many shops.\nTurkish coffee is made by bringing the powdered coffee with water and usually sugar to the boil in a special pot called \"cezve\" in Turkey, and often called \"ibrik\" elsewhere. As soon as the mixture begins to froth, and before it boils over, it is taken off the heat; it may be briefly reheated twice more to increase the desired froth. Sometimes about one-third of the coffee is distributed to individual cups; the remaining amount is returned to the fire and distributed to the cups as soon as it comes to the boil. The coffee is traditionally served in a special type of small porcelain cup called a \"kahve finjanı\".\n\nSugar is added to Turkish coffee while brewing, so the amount of sugar must be specified when preparing the coffee. It may be served unsweetened (), with little or moderate sugar (), or sweet (). Coffee is often served with something small and sweet to eat, such as Turkish delight. It is sometimes flavoured with cardamom, mastic, salep, or ambergris.\nA lot of the powdered coffee grounds are transferred from the \"cezve\" to the cup; in the cup, some settle on the bottom but much remains in suspension and is consumed with the coffee.\n\nFirst appearing in the Ottoman Empire, under the strictest interpretations of the Quran the strong coffee was considered a drug and its consumption was forbidden. Due to the immense popularity of the beverage, the sultan eventually lifted this prohibition.\n\nTurkish coffee culture had reached Britain and France by the mid to late 17th century. The first coffee house in Britain was opened by a Turkish Jew in the mid 17th century. In the 1680s, the Turkish ambassador to France reportedly threw lavish parties for the city's elite where African slaves served coffee to guests in porcelain \"finjan\"s on gold or silver saucers.\n\nThe word Coffee derives from the Turkish word kahve from Arabic qahwa.\n\nSuperstition says the grounds left after drinking Turkish coffee can be used for fortune-telling. The cup is commonly turned over into the saucer to cool, and it is believed by some that the patterns of the coffee grounds can be used for a method of fortune telling known as tasseography.\n\nAs well as being an everyday beverage, Turkish coffee is also a part of the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present from the girl, although in some parts of the country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.\n\nTurkish coffee is usually called either \"Turkish coffee\" in the local language, or named as the coffee of the country or region, e.g. \"Greek coffee\", \"Arab[ic] coffee\", etc.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkish coffee is also called \"Bosnian coffee\" (Bosnian: \"bosanska kahva\"), which is made slightly differently from its Turkish counterpart. A deviation from the Turkish preparation is that when the water reaches its boiling point, a small amount is saved aside for later, usually in a coffee cup. Then, the coffee is added to the pot (džezva), and the remaining water in the cup is added to the pot. Everything is put back on the heat source to reach its boiling point again, which only takes a couple of seconds since the coffee is already very hot. Coffee drinking in Bosnia is a traditional daily custom and plays an important role during social gatherings.\n\nA beverage called \"turecká káva\" or \"turek\" is very popular in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, although other forms of coffee preparation such as espresso have become more popular in the last few decades, decreasing the popularity of \"turek\". \"Turek\" is usually no longer served in cafés, but it is prepared in pubs and kiosks, and in homes. The Czech and Slovak form of Turkish coffee is different from Turkish coffee in Turkey, the Arab world or Balkan countries, since a \"cezve\" is not used; instead the desired amount of ground coffee is poured into boiling or almost boiling water. In recent years, Turkish coffee is also made in a \"cezve\" (\"džezva\" in Czech), but \"Turkish coffee\" usually means the method described above. Coffee is prepared in the same way in Lithuania.\n\nIn Greece, Turkish coffee was formerly referred to simply as 'Turkish' (τούρκικος). But political tensions with Turkey in the 1960s led to the political euphemism \"Greek coffee\" (ελληνικός καφές), which became even more popular after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974: \"... Greek–Turkish relations at all levels became strained, 'Turkish coffee' became 'Greek coffee' by substitution of one Greek word for another while leaving the Arabic loan-word, for which there is no Greek equivalent, unchanged.\" There were even advertising campaigns promoting the name \"Greek coffee\" in the 1990s, which acknowledged the usage of \"Turkish\": \"Thousands of Greeks follow the habit of calling their beloved coffee 'Turkish'.\"\n\nIn Armenia, the coffee is also called “Armenian Coffee” or simply “Sourj”. In Armenia the beverage has become a cultural phenomena—families will open their house to visitors that want to enjoy the very special drink. Armenians will sometimes serve baklava alongside the coffee.\n\nAccording to \"The Reuben Percy Anecdotes\" compiled by journalist Thomas Byerley an Armenian opened a coffee shop in Europe in 1674, at a time when coffee was first becoming fashionable in the West. Though Percy described these first European coffee houses as \"imperfect\" establishments where liquor and cigarettes were still consumed, he notes that it was an \"error of the Armenian\" that led to the establishment of a coffeehouse in Paris called Le Procope which introduced what Percy calls \"ices\".\n\nIn Serbia and Montenegro, it is called \"Turkish coffee\" (турска кафа / \"turska kafa\"), \"domestic coffee\" (домаћа кафа / \"domaća kafa\") or simply \"coffee\" (кафа / \"kafa\"). It is nearly identical to the Turkish version.\n\nIn Iran, Turkish coffee is very popular and is known as \"\"qahve Tork\"\", which is usually made in North Western Iran.\n\n<br>\n"}

It is generally a mixture of custard, cream, and milk, without eggs.\n\nGelato is made with a base of milk and sugar. It is generally lower in fat than other styles of ice cream. Gelato typically contains less air and more flavoring than other kinds of frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.\n\nThe Italian law requires gelato to have a minimum of 3.5% butterfat. \n\nGelato can be served in any way that ice cream is, including cup, cone, sandwich, cake, pie, or on a stick.\n\nGelato was invented by Bernardo Buontalenti, in Florence (Tuscany), during the Renaissance period. The Buontalenti created the dessert for the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, who wanted him to organize an opulent banquet to celebrate the Spanish deputation. In Florence, most shops selling hand-made ice-cream also usually offer a \"Buontalenti\" flavour. In the late 1600s, the Sicilian fisherman and cafe founder Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli is credited with being the inventor of modern gelato.\nHowever, the popularity of gelato among larger shares of the population only increased in the 1920s–1930s in the northern Italian city of Varese, where the first gelato cart was developed. Italy is the only country where the market share of artisanal gelato versus mass-produced gelato is over 55%. Today, more than 5,000 modern Italian ice cream parlors employ over 15,000 people.\n\nThe traditional flavors of gelato consist of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, pistachio, cream (also known as custard), and Stracciatella (fior-di-latte gelato with chocolate chunks). \n\nThe more modern flavors consist of fruity flavors such as raspberry, mango, and pineapple.\n\nThe hot process consists of heating the ingredients to 85°C (185 °F) for pasteurization. Then, it is lowered to 5°C (41°F) and mixed to the desired texture.\n\nThe cold process mixes the ingredients and is batched in the freezer.\n\nIn the \"sprint\" process milk or water is added to a package of ingredients which is then mixed and batched.\n\nAs with other ice creams, the sugar in gelato prevents it from freezing solid by binding to the water and interfering with the normal formation of ice crystals. This creates smaller ice crystals and results in the smooth texture of gelato. American commercial gelati are typically sweetened with sucrose, dextrose, or inverted sugar, and include a stabilizer such as guar gum.\n\n\n"}

The Meiji era was a period in which Japan was becoming increasingly westernized, and many samurai who lost their jobs were given work that was totally new to them. The Western role of baker was one such job.\n\nOne day, while wandering around the area where many people employed in Western jobs worked, Kimura Yasubei found a young man making breads and an idea was born; the starting of the bakery named \"Bun'eidō\" (文英堂). In 1874, he moved to Ginza and renamed the bakery \"Kimuraya\" (木村屋), now \"Kimuraya Sohonten\"(). At that time, however, the only recipe for bread known in Japan was for making a salty and sour-tasting bread, ill-suited to Japanese tastes at the time. Yasubei wanted to make a bread that was more to Japanese tastes. Finally, he figured out how to make bread in the way of the Japanese manjū – raising the dough with the traditional sakadane liquid yeast. He then filled the bread with a bean paste wagashi and sold anpan as snacks. Anpan was very popular, not only because of its taste, but also because the Japanese were interested in anything new and foreign at this time.\n\nLater, a man called Yamaoka Tesshū, a chamberlain of the Meiji emperor, who loved anpan, asked the Tokugawas, the rulers of Japan before the Meiji Period, to present anpans to the emperor when visiting him. So the Tokugawas asked Yasubei to make some for the emperor. Yasubei worked hard to make the anpan and, because he also cared about their appearance, he decorated them with a salt-pickled sakura in the middle of each bun. This anpan was presented to the Meiji emperor on April 4, 1875. The Emperor told Yasubei to present him anpan every day, and because of the rumor that the Emperor ate anpan, the popularity of bread, and especially anpan, began spreading around the country.\n\nAnpan is often used as slang for recreational inhalation of paint thinner.\n\nThe picture book and anime series \"Anpanman\" is about a superhero whose head is made of anpan.\n\nIn the anime franchise \"Clannad\" the main character Nagisa Furukawa often mentions \"Anpan\" to herself.\n\nIn anime \"Gintama\", character Sagaru Yamazaki is seen eating anpan as a ritual that references famous Japanese TV detective dramas while going undercover and eventually goes insane because of it (episode 205).\n\nIn the tokusatsu series \"Denshi Sentai Denjiman\", the character Daigorou Oume/Denji Bue loves anpan. Long after the series ending, he appears in the movie \"Gokaiger vs. Goseiger\" and sells anpan.\n\nThe \"San-X\" character, Kogepan, is a burnt anpan who is depressed and gets drunk from milk.\n\nThe \"Log Horizon\" character Akatsuki loves anpan, but feels that it's best when accompanied by green tea.\n\nIn the anime \"Deadman Wonderland\", the price for participating in the \"Dogs Race\" organized by Tamaki, is anpan.\n\n"}

In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.\n\nThe name comes from an Aztec dialect via Nahuatl , which literally translates to \"avocado sauce\", from \"āhuacatl\" (\"avocado\") + \"molli\" (\"sauce\", literally \"concoction\"). In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced , in American English, it tends to be pronounced , and in British English, .\n\nAvocados were first cultivated in South Central Mexico about 10,000 years ago. In the early 1900s, avocados frequently went by the name \"alligator pear\". The Hass avocado is named after postal worker Rudolph Hass who purchased a seedling in 1926 from a California farmer and patented it in 1935.\n\nGuacamole has increased avocado sales in the US, especially on Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo. The rising consumption of guacamole is most likely due to the U.S. government lifting a ban on avocado imports in the 1990s and the growth of the U.S. Latino population.\n\nGuacamole dip is traditionally made by mashing ripe avocados and sea salt with a \"molcajete y tejolote\" (mortar and pestle). Recipes call for tomato, garlic, lemon or lime juice, chili or cayenne pepper, cilantro (UK English: coriander) or basil, \"jalapeño\" and additional seasonings. Some non-traditional recipes call for sour cream or even peas.\n\nDue to the presence of polyphenol oxidase in the cells of avocado, exposure to oxygen in the air causes an enzymatic reaction and develops melanoidin pigment, turning the sauce brown. This result is generally considered unappetizing, and there are several methods (some anecdotal) that are used to counter this effect, such as storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or wrapping tightly in plastic to limit the surface area exposed to the air.\n\nAs the major ingredient of guacamole is raw avocado, the nutritional value of the dish derives from avocado vitamins, minerals and fats, providing dietary fiber, several B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E and potassium in significant content (see Daily Value percentages in nutrient table for avocado). Avocados are a source of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol. They also contain carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein.\n\n\"Mantequilla de pobre\" () is a mixture of avocado, tomato, oil, and citrus juice. Despite its name, it predates the arrival of dairy cattle in the Americas, and thus was not originally made as a butter substitute.\n\nThinner and more acidic, or thick and chunky, \"guasacaca\" is a Venezuelan avocado-based sauce; it is made with vinegar, and is served over \"parrillas\" (grilled food), \"arepas\", \"empanadas\", and various other dishes. It is common to make the \"guasacaca\" with a little hot sauce instead of \"jalapeño\", but like a guacamole, it is not usually served as a hot sauce itself. Pronounced \"wasakaka\" in Latin America.\n\nPrepared guacamoles are available in stores, often available refrigerated, frozen or in high pressure packaging which pasteurizes and extends shelf life if products are maintained at .\n\nNational Guacamole Day is celebrated on the same day as Mexican Independence Day, September 16.\n\nOn September 3, 2017, 815 gastronomy students set the world record in Concepción de Buenos Aires, Jalisco, Mexico for the largest serving of guacamole, which weighed .\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Junta Local de Sanidad Vegetal de Tancítaro, Mexico, achieved the Guinness World Records for the largest serving of guacamole. They created it as part of Tancítaro's 7th Annual Avocado Festival in Tancítaro, Michoacán, Mexico. The serving weighed 3,788 kg (8,351 lb) and had more than 350 people help prepare it.\n\n"}
{"id": "484954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=484954", "title": "Quesadilla", "text": "Quesadilla\n\nA quesadilla ( or ; ), or sometimes specifically a cheese quesadilla, is a Mexican dish, consisting of a tortilla that is filled primarily with cheese, and sometimes meats, beans, vegetables, and spices, and then cooked on a griddle. Traditionally, a corn tortilla is used, but it can also be made with a flour tortilla, particularly in northern Mexico and the United States. \n\nA \"full quesadilla\" is made with two tortillas that hold a layer of cheese between them. A \"half\" is a single tortilla that has been filled with cheese and folded into a half-moon shape. A quick version of the quesadilla, the cheese tortilla, is microwaved and often served to kids.\n\nThe quesadilla has its origins in colonial Mexico. The quesadilla as a food has changed and evolved over many years as people experimented with different variations of it. Quesadillas are frequently sold at Mexican restaurants all over the world.\n\nIn the central and southern regions of Mexico, a quesadilla is a flat circle of cooked corn masa, called a \"tortilla\", warmed to soften it enough to be folded in half, and then filled. They are typically filled with Oaxaca cheese (\"queso Oaxaca\"), a stringy Mexican cheese made by the \"pasta filata\" (stretched-curd) method. The quesadilla is then cooked on a \"comal\" until the cheese has completely melted. They are usually cooked without the addition of any oil. Often the quesadillas are served with green or red salsa, chopped onion, and guacamole. While Oaxaca (or string) cheese is the most common filling, other ingredients are also used in addition to, or even substituting for, the cheese. These can include cooked vegetables, such as potatoes with \"chorizo\", squash blossoms, mushrooms, \"epazote\", \"huitlacoche\", and different types of cooked meat, such as \"chicharron\", \"tinga\" made of chicken or beef, or cooked pork. In some places, quesadillas are also topped with other ingredients, in addition to the fillings they already have. Avocado or guacamole, chopped onion, tomato, serrano chiles, and cilantro are the most common. Salsas may also be added as a topping.\nMexican quesadillas are traditionally cooked on a \"comal\", which is also used to prepare tortillas. As a variation, the quesadillas can be fried in oil to make \"quesadillas fritas\". The main difference is that, while the traditional ones are prepared by filling the partially cooked tortillas, then cooked until the cheese melts, the fried ones are prepared like a pastry, preparing the uncooked masa in small circles, then topping with the filling and finally folding the quesadilla to form the pastry. It is then immersed into hot oil until the exterior looks golden and crispy.\n\nOther variations include the use of wheat flour tortillas instead, especially in northeastern Mexico. Wheat dough is most commonly used in place of corn masa. In this case, the flour tortilla is prepared, folded and filled with cheese, exactly as the corn.\n\nSometimes, cheese and ham are sandwiched between two flour tortillas, then cut into wedges to serve what is commonly known as \"sincronizada\" (Spanish for \"synchronized\") in Mexico. Despite appearing almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a completely different dish. Tourists frequently confuse the \"sincronizada\" with the quesadilla because it is typically called a quesadilla in most Mexican restaurants outside of Mexico.\n\nThe quesadilla is a regional favorite in the southwestern U.S. where it is similar to a grilled cheese sandwich. It is prepared in a similar manner except for the inclusion of local ingredients. A flour tortilla is heated on a griddle, then flipped and sprinkled with a grated, melting cheese (\"queso quesadilla\"), such as Monterey Jack, Cheddar cheese, or Colby Jack. Once the cheese melts, other ingredients; such as shredded meat, peppers, onions, or guacamole may be added, and it is then folded and served.\n\nAnother preparation involves cheese and other ingredients sandwiched between two flour tortillas, with the whole package grilled on an oiled griddle and flipped so both sides are cooked and the cheese is melted. This version is often cut into wedges to serve. A home appliance (quesadilla maker) is sold to produce this kind of quesadilla, although it does not use oil and cooks both sides at once. This type is similar to the Mexican \"sincronizada\"; but in the United States, they often also have fajita beef or chicken or other ingredients instead of ham. That kind of quesadilla is also Mexican, and it is called \"gringa\" (the name varies in some regions in Mexico, there's also a type of quesadilla called \"chavindeca\").\n\nThere is a lot of regional variation to specific recipes throughout the Southwest.\n\nQuesadillas have been adapted to many different styles. In the United States, many restaurants serve them as appetizers, after adding their own twist. Some variations use goat cheese, black beans, spinach, zucchini, or tofu.\n\nEven dessert quesadillas are made, using ingredients such as chocolate, butterscotch, caramel and different fruits.\n\n"}

Conventionally, \"youtiao\" are lightly salted and made so they can be torn lengthwise in two. \"Youtiao\" are normally eaten at breakfast as an accompaniment for rice congee, soy milk or regular milk blended with sugar.\n\nIn Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, they are called You Char Kway/Cakwe/Cakoi/Kueh/Kuay; and Bicho in the Philippines.\n\nAt breakfast, \"youtiao\" can be stuffed inside \"shāobǐng\" (Traditional Chinese: 燒餅, Simplified Chinese:烧饼; literally \"roasted flatbread\") to make a sandwich known as shāobǐng yóutiáo (Traditional Chinese: 燒餅油條, Simplified Chinese： 烧饼油条). Youtiao wrapped in a rice noodle roll is known as \"zháliǎng\". In Yunnan, a roasted riceflour pancake usually wrapped around a \"youtiao\" is known as \"shaoerkuai\" (). Yet another name for a sandwich variant is \"jianbingguǒzi\" ().\n\n\"Youtiao\" are used to dip into various soups, for example \"xidoufen\".\n\nYoutiao is also an important ingredient of the food \"Cífàn tuán\" in Shanghai cuisine.\n\n\"Tánggāo\" (), or \"sugar cake\", is a sweet, fried food item similar in appearance to youtiao but shorter in length.\n\nIn Thailand, \"youtiao\" or \"pathongko\" () in Thai are eaten for breakfast with soymilk or porridge. In Cambodia, it's called \"chhakhvay\" (ឆាខ្វៃ) and often eaten with \"kuy teav\" (គុយទាវ) (noodle soup) for breakfast.\n\nAlthough generally known as \"yóutiáo\" in Standard Mandarin throughout China, the dish is also known as \"guǒzi\" (餜子) in northern China. In Min Nan-speaking areas, such as Taiwan, it is known as \"iû-chiā-kóe\" (), where \"kóe\" (粿/餜) means cake or pastry, hence \"oil-fried cake/pastry\". In Cantonese-speaking areas this is rendered as \"yàuhjagwái\" (油炸鬼), where \"gwái\" literally means \"devil\" or \"ghost\".\n\nThe Cantonese name \"yàuhjagwái\" literally means \"oil-fried devil\" and, according to folklore, is an act of protest against Song Dynasty official Qin Hui, who is said to have orchestrated the plot to frame the general Yue Fei, an icon of patriotism in Chinese culture. It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general's demise. Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple. In keeping with the legend, youtiao are often made as two foot-long rolls of dough joined along the middle, with one roll representing the husband and the other the wife.\n\nIn Indonesia, the fried dough is known as \"cakwe\" (). It is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast with \"bubur ayam\" (chicken porridge) or eaten as snacks with dipping of local version of chilli vinaigrette or peanut/Saturday sauce.\n\nIn Laos, youtiao is generally called \"patongko\" (\"cf.\" Thai \"patongko\") or \"chao quay\", and is commonly eaten with coffee at breakfast in place of a baguette (\"khao jee falang\"). It is also eaten as an accompaniment to \"khao piek sen\" (chicken noodle soup) or \"jok\" (congee).\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, it is known in English as \"you char kway\", \"you char kuey\", or \"u char kway\", which are transliterations of its local Hokkien (Minnan) name (油炸粿 \"iû-chiā-kóe\"). It is rendered in Malay as \"cakoi\", an alteration of the Minnan term, \"char kuey\". The Malay version comes with various fillings, which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savoury, such as sardines fried in tomato sauce. The plain version is usually eaten with coconut and egg jam \"kaya\". Cakoi is usually sold in morning street markets or \"pasar malam\" night markets.\n\nIt is also normally served with Bak kut teh (肉骨茶), porridge or rice congee, sliced thinly to be dipped into the broth/congee and eaten. It is also commonly eaten with coffee or soy milk for breakfast.\n\nThe youtiao is also a popular breakfast food in Myanmar (Burma) where it is called \"e kya kway\". It is usually eaten with steamed yellow beans (with salt and oil). It is also usually dipped into coffee or tea. E kya kway is also eaten with rice porridge, or cut into small rings and used as a condiment for mohinga.\nTea culture is very prevalent in Myanmar, and every shop will serve e kya kway for breakfast.\n\nSome shops stuff meat into the youtiao and deep fry it over again. It is called \"e kya kway asar thoot\" – stuffed e kya kway.\n\nIn the Philippines, youtiao is called \"bicho\" (pl. \"bicho-bicho\"); although this name can also refer to sweetened, fried glutinous rice desserts called \"cascaron\", adapted from the Spanish \"buñuelo\". In the Visayan region, a similar doughnut is called \"siakoy\", usually twined like a rope.\n\nIn Thailand, youtiao is generally called \"pathongko\" (, ) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. \"Pathongko\" is a loanword adapted from either Teochew Minnan \"beh teung guai\" (白糖粿; Mandarin: \"bái tángguǒ\") or Cantonese of \"baahktònggòu\" (白糖糕; Mandarin: bái tánggāo). However, both possible original names are different desserts, not to be confused with the real white sugar sponge cake (白糖糕). It was previously sold together with youtiao by street vendors who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was \"\"pathongko\"\". Eventually, the real \"pathongko\" disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. Ironically, the disappearance of real \"\"pathongko\"\" leaves youtiao being called under the former's name, but the latter's real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais. But the original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in Trang Province in Southern Thailand under its original name. Both Thailand and Cambodia are relatively neighbors to each other. So this is how they both have similar cuisines in ways.\n\nIn Thailand, pathongko is also dipped into condensed milk or, in the South, eaten with kaya.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, it is known by a name that is a mix of Sino-Vietnamese and native Vietnamese to achieve a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese name, as \"dầu cháo quẩy\", \"giò cháo quẩy\" or simply \"quẩy\". 油 (\"Dầu/giò\") 鬼 (\"quỷ/quẩy\") coming from the approximate Chinese name. In Vietnam, giò cháo quẩy is eaten typically with congee, pho in Hanoi and sometimes with wonton noodle (\"mi hoanh thanh\").\n\nIn Cambodia, it is called Cha Kway. In Cambodia, it is dipped in rice porridge, noodle soups like Phnom Penh noodle soup kuy teav, coffee, or condensed milk.\n\nIn Australia it is sometimes called chopstick cake by some Cambodian Chinese immigrants because of its resemblance to a pair of chopsticks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Sweden it is most commonly known as just \"semla\" (plural: \"semlor\"), but is also known as \"fettisdagsbulle\" (\"fat tuesday roll\"). In the southern parts of Sweden, as well as in Swedish-speaking Finland, it is known as \"fastlagsbulle\" (plural: \"fastlagsbullar\"; semla on the other hand means a plain wheat bun with butter, called \"fralla\" in Sweden). In Norway and Denmark it is called \"fastelavnsbolle\". In Iceland, it's known as a \"bolla\" and served on Bolludagur. Semla served in a bowl of hot milk is \"hetvägg\". \n\nThe name \"semla\" (plural, \"semlor\") is a loan word from German \"Semmel\", originally deriving from the Latin \"simila\", meaning 'flour', itself a borrowing from Greek \"σεμίδαλις (semidalis)\", \"groats\", which was the name used for the finest quality wheat flour or semolina. In the southernmost part of Sweden (Scania) and by the Swedish-speaking population in Finland, they are known as \"fastlagsbulle\". In Denmark and Norway they are known as \"fastelavnsbolle\" (\"fastlagen\" and \"fastelavn\" being the equivalent of Shrove Tuesday). In Scanian, the feast is also called \"fastelann\". In Finnish they are known as \"laskiaispulla\", in Latvian as \"vēja kūkas\", and in Estonian as \"vastlakukkel\".\n\nToday, the Swedish-Finnish semla consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off, and is then filled with a mix of milk and almond paste, topped with whipped cream. The cut-off top serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. Today it is often eaten on its own, with coffee or tea. Some people still eat it in a bowl of hot milk. In Finland, the bun is often filled with strawberry or raspberry jam instead of almond paste, and bakeries in Finland usually offer both versions. (Many bakeries distinguish between the two by decorating the traditional bun with almonds on top, whereas the jam-filled version has powdered sugar on top). In Finland-Swedish, \"semla\" means a plain wheat bun, used for bread and butter, and not a sweet bun. At some point Swedes grew tired of the strict observance of Lent, added cream and almond paste to the mix and started eating semla every Tuesday between Shrove Tuesday and Easter.\nEvery year, at around the same time that the bakeries fill with semlor, the Swedish newspapers start to fill with semla taste tests. Panels of ‘experts’ dissect and inspect tables full of semlor to find the best in town.\n\nSome bakeries have created alternative forms of the pastry, such as the \"semmelwrap\" formed as a wrap rather than the traditional bun, while others have added e.g. chocolate, marzipan, or pistachios to the recipe. \n\nIn Finland and Estonia the traditional dessert predates Christian influences. Laskiaissunnuntai and Laskiaistiistai were festivals when children and youth would go sledding or downhill sliding on a hill or a slope to determine how the crop would yield in the coming year. Those who slid the farthest were going to get the best crop. Hence the festival is named after the act of sliding or sledding downhill, \"laskea\". Nowadays laskiainen has been integrated into Christian customs as the beginning of lent before Easter.\n\nFastelavnsbolle consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off, and is then filled with whipped cream, topped with jam. The cut-off top serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. The buns are served at Sunday of Fastelavn (Shrove Sunday), but were previously associated with Shrove Tuesday.\n\nThe version sold in Danish bakeries on or around Shrove Monday is rather different, made from puff pastry and filled with whipped cream, a bit of jam and often with icing on top. At home people may bake a version more similar to a usual wheat roll, mixing plain yeast dough with raisins, succade and sometimes candied bitter orange peel.\n\nIn Iceland it is done in a similar way but in place of puff pastry more common is the choux pastry version.\n\nIn Icelandic Shrove Monday is called \"bolludagur\" (bun day), named after the pastry.\n\nThe oldest version of the \"semla\" was a plain bread bun, eaten in a bowl of warm milk. In Swedish this is known as \"hetvägg\", from Middle Low German \"hete Weggen\" (hot wedges) or German \"heisse Wecken\" (hot buns) and falsely interpreted as \"hotwall\".\nThe semla was originally eaten only on Shrove Tuesday, as the last festive food before Lent. However, with the arrival of the Protestant Reformation, the Swedes stopped observing a strict fasting for Lent. The semla in its bowl of warm milk became a traditional dessert every Tuesday between Shrove Tuesday and Easter. Today, semlor are available in shops and bakeries every day from shortly after Christmas until Easter. Each Swede consumes on average four to five bakery-produced semlor each year, in addition to any that are homemade.\n\nKing Adolf Frederick of Sweden died of digestion problems on February 12, 1771 after consuming a meal consisting of lobster, caviar, sauerkraut, smoked herring and champagne, which was topped off by fourteen helpings of \"hetvägg\" (semla), the king's favorite dessert.\n\nThis was the sweet chosen to represent Finland in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.\n\n"}

The dessert was invented in the 1950s by Dr. Ernest Velden, an immigrant from then Czechoslovakia. He set up a factory in Eastbourne producing Arctic Roll in 1968, and the dessert soon became a successful product. During the 1980s, more than of Birds Eye Arctic Roll were sold each month. However, sales slumped during the 1990s and eventually the manufacturer of Arctic Roll, Birds Eye, stopped producing the dessert. The 2008 economic downturn saw the reappearance of Arctic Roll as consumers increasingly looked for low-cost foods.\n\nWhile some consumers view the Arctic Roll as comfort food, others view it as old fashioned and the food writer Nigel Slater has even described it as tasting of \"frozen carpet\". Nonetheless, Birds Eye reported \"overwhelming consumer demand\" for the dessert. Indeed, from when Birds Eye started marketing Arctic Rolls again in December 2008 until April 2009, sales of the product were estimated at £3.5 million, or 3 million boxes (around of Arctic Roll). Commentators suggest that aside from Arctic Roll's low price, many consumers buy the dessert out of feelings of nostalgia. A number of UK supermarkets sell their own brand versions of Arctic Roll, both chocolate and raspberry variants, and did so even when Birds Eye were not marketing the product.\n\nThe original Arctic Roll features vanilla ice cream and raspberry jam; Birds Eye also produce a variant using chocolate ice cream.\n"}

It may have developed from those dishes, which are useful for feeding groups of people on a budget: for example at a sports match or at harvest time.\n\nA pie floater commonly consists of a traditional Australian-style meat pie, usually sitting, but sometimes submerged (sometimes upside down) in a bowl of thick pea soup made from blue boiler peas. It is often self-garnished with tomato sauce, and the consumer may also add a combination of mint sauce, salt, pepper, or malt vinegar according to personal preference.\n\nPie floaters were typically purchased in the street from pie-carts, as a late evening meal. Pie-carts are typically a form of caravan/trailer/cart, (originally horse-drawn), with an elongated \"window\" along one or both sides where customers sit or (more usually) stand to eat their purchases. The pie-cart was typically moved into position at lunch time and in the evening. As traffic became busier and on-street car-parking in demand, the carts evolved to have one window on \"the footpath side\", and were moved into position after afternoon peak-hour traffic had ebbed. They do business until late-evening or early-morning, after which they were returned to their daytime storage locations.\n\nSouth Australia has had pie carts in the Adelaide metropolitan area since the 1870s. In the evenings, the Norwood pie-cart was located on The Parade adjacent to the Norwood Town Hall. It was also the only place where members of the public could buy draft Hall's \"Stonie\" ginger beer directly from the keg. In the Adelaide city centre in the 1880s, there were 13 pie-carts operating in King William Street and North Terrace. By 1915 there were nine pie-carts in operation. By 1958 this had reduced to two: Balfour's pie-cart on North Terrace outside the Adelaide railway station, and Cowley's in Victoria Square outside the G.P.O. In 2007, the Glenelg Tramline was extended from Victoria Square along King William Street and North Terrace past the Adelaide Railway Station, and the Balfour's pie-cart was forced to close.\n\nIn 2003, The South Australian National Trust traced the history of the pie floater: an impressive history tracing back 130+ years. In 2003, the pie floater was recognised as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia, but is now available at a very few locations, one being the Café de Vilis, Enjoy Bakery on Norwood Parade and another the Upper Sturt General Store. Floaters using traditional pea soup or the more new age pumpkin soup can also be found at Prices Fresh bakery outlets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "488582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488582", "title": "Barrio", "text": "Barrio\n\nBarrio () is a Spanish word meaning a quarter or neighbourhood. In Spain, several Latin American countries and the Philippines, the term is also used officially to denote a division of a municipality.\n\nIn Argentina and Uruguay, a barrio is a division of a municipality officially delineated by the local authority at a later time, and it sometimes keeps a distinct character from others (as in the barrios of Buenos Aires even if they have been superseded by larger administrative divisions). The word does not have a special socioeconomic connotation unless it is used in contrast to the \"centro\" (city center or downtown). The expression \"barrio cerrado\" (translated \"closed neighborhood\") is employed for small, upper-class, residential settlements, planned with an exclusive criterion and often literally enclosed in walls (a kind of gated community).\n\nIn Colombia, the term is used for any urban area neighborhood whose geographical limits are determined locally. The term does not have any implication of social class, as it is used to refer to not only working-class areas but also well-to-do ones. The term \"barrio de invasión\" or \"comuna\" is more often used to refer to shanty towns, but the term \"barrio\" has a more general use.\n\nIn Cuba, El Salvador and Spain, the term barrio is used officially to denote a subdivision of a \"municipio\" (or municipality); each \"barrio\" is subdivided into sectors. \n\nIn Puerto Rico, the term \"barrio\" is used to denote a subdivision of a \"municipio\" and its lowest officially recognized administrative unit. A barrio in Puerto Rico is not vested with political authority. It may, or may not, be further subdivided into sectors, communities, \"urbanizaciones\", or a combination of these, but such further subdivisions, though popular and common, are unofficial.\n\nIn the Philippines, the term \"barrio\" once referred to a rural village, but it was changed by law in 1975 to the term \"barangay\", the basic unit of government with an average population of 2,500 people. It is still used informally to refer to small rural towns and villages, as opposed to \"barangay\" which can be used for both rural settlements and urban municipal districts (the latter formerly known as \"visitas\"). It is alternatively spelled as \"baryo\", though the preferred spelling is the Spanish one.\n\nThe United States usage of the term \"barrio\" is also found in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, where \"barrio\" is commonly given to slums in the outer rims of big cities such as Caracas and Santo Domingo as well as lower- and middle-class neighborhoods in other cities and towns. Well-known localities in the United States containing a sector called \"Barrio\" include Manhattan (Spanish Harlem), East Los Angeles, California; Second Ward, Houston, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, and Miami, Florida (Allapattah). Some of them are referred to as just \"El Barrio\" by the locals and nearby residents.\n\nOver the centuries, selectness in the Spanish Empire evolved as a mosaic of the various barrios, surrounding the central administrative areas. As they matured, the barrios functionally and symbolically reproduced the city and in some way tended to replicate it. The barrio reproduced the city through providing occupational, social, physical and spiritual space. With the emergence of an enlarged merchant class some barrios were able to support a wide range of economic levels. This led to new patterns of social class distribution throughout the city. Those who could afford to locate in and around the central plazas did so. The poor and marginal groups still occupied the spaces at the city's edge.\n\nThe desire on the part of the sector popular to replicate a barrio was expressed through the diversity of the populace and functions and the tendency to form social hierarchies and to maintain social control. The limits to replication were mainly social. Any particular barrio could not easily expand territorially into other barrios, nor could it easily export its particular social identity to others. Different barrios provided different products and services to the city, e.g. one might make shoes while another made cheese. Integration of daily life could also be seen in the religious sector, where a parish and a \"convento\" might serve one or more neighborhoods.\n\nThe mosaic formed by the barrios and the colonial center continued until the period of independence in Mexico and Latin America. The general urban pattern was one where the old central plaza was surrounded by an intermediate ring of barrios and emerging suburban areas linking the city to the hinterland. The general governance of the city was in the hands of a mayor and city councilors. Public posts were purchased and funds given to the local government and the royal bureaucracy. Fairness and equity were not high on the list of public interests. Lands located on the periphery were given to individuals by local authorities, even if this land was designated for collective uses, such as farming or grazing. This practice of peripheral land expansion laid the groundwork for later suburbanization by immigrants from outside the region and by real estate agents.\n\nAt the edge of Hispanic American colonial cities there were places where work, trade, social interaction and symbolic spiritual life occurred. These barrios were created to meet the space needs of local craftsman and the shelter needs of the working class. At times they were designed to meet municipal norms, but they usually responded to functional requirements of the users. Barrios were built over centuries of sociocultural interaction within urban space. In Mexico and in other Latin American countries with strong heritages of colonial centers, the concept of barrio no longer contains the social, cultural and functional attributes of the past. The few surviving barrios do so with a loss of traditional meaning. For most of them the word has become a descriptive category or a generic definition.\n\nThe corresponding term in Portuguese-speaking countries is bairro.\n\n\"Barrio\" and \"Barrios\" are also Spanish surnames. In Portugal, the derived surname \"Barros\" is very common.\n\n\n\n"}

Various other spellings and dialect forms were used. The primary form and derivation are uncertain.\n\nA 1743 English cookery book \"The Lady's Companion: or, An Infallible Guide to the Fair Sex\" contained a recipe for \"Calf's Chitterlings\" which was essentially a bacon and offal sausage in a calf's intestine casing. The recipe explained the use of calf's, rather than the more usual pig's, intestines with the comment that \"[these] sort of ... puddings must be made in summer, when hogs are seldom killed\". This recipe was repeated by the English cookery writer Hannah Glasse in her 1784 cookery book \"Art of Cookery\".\n\nLinguist Paul Anthony Jones has written, \"in the late 1500s a \"chitterling\" was an ornate type of neck ruff, so called because its frilled edge looked like the folds of a slaughtered animal's entrails\".\n\nAs pigs are a common source of meat in many parts of the world, the dish known as chitterlings can be found in most pork-eating cultures. Chitterlings made from pig intestines are popular in many parts of Europe, and are still eaten in the southern U.S.\n\nChitterlings were common peasant food in medieval England, and remained a staple of the diet of low-income families right up until the late 19th century and not uncommon into the mid 20th century. Thomas Hardy wrote of chitterlings in his novel \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\", when the father of a poor family, John Durbeyfield, talks of what he would like to eat:\n\nTell 'em at home that I should like for supper, – well, lamb's fry if they can get it; and if they can't, black-pot; and if they can't get that, well, chitterlings will do.\n\nIt illustrates that chitterlings were the poorest choice of poor food. George Sturt, writing in 1919 details the food eaten by his farming family in Farnborough when he was a child (probably around 1830):\n\nDuring the winter they had chance to weary of almost every form and kind of pig-meat: hog's puddings, gammons, chitterlings, souse, salted spareribs -they knew all the varieties and welcomed any change. Mutton they almost never tasted: but sometimes they had a calf's head; sometimes even, though less often, a joint of veal.\n\nChitterlings are the subject of a song by 1970s Scrumpy and Western comedy folk band, The Wurzels, who come from the southwest of England. Chitterlings, though much declined in popularity, are still enjoyed in the UK today.\n\nKokoretsi, kukurec, or kokoreç, are usually prepared and stuffed, then grilled on a spit. In several countries such as Turkey, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, lamb intestines are widely used. In Turkish cuisine, the intestines are often chopped and cooked with oregano, peppers, and other spices.\n\nGallinejas are a traditional dish in Madrid. The dish consists of sheep's small intestines, spleen, and pancreas, fried in their own fat in such a manner that they form small spirals. The dish is served hot, often with French fries. Few establishments today serve \"gallinejas\", as this is considered to be more of a speciality than a common dish. It is most commonly served during festivals.\n\nZarajo: A traditional dish from Cuenca is zarajo, braided sheep's intestines rolled on a vine branch and usually broiled, but also sometimes fried, and sometimes smoked, usually served hot as an appetizer or tapa. A similar dish from La Rioja is embuchados, and from the province of Aragon, madejas, all made with sheep's intestines and served as tapas.\n\nTricandilles are a traditional dish in Gironde. They are made of pig's small intestines, boiled in bouillon, then grilled on a fire of grapevine cane. This is considered an expensive delicacy.\n\nAndouillette is a type of sausage, found especially in Troyes, which is made predominantly of pig chitterlings.\n\nAndouille is another kind of French chitterlings sausage found especially in Brittany and Normandy.\n\nPeople in the Caribbean and Latin America eat chitterlings. Chinchulín (in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) or chunchule (in Chile) (from the Quechua \"ch'unchul\", meaning \"intestine\") is the cow's small intestine used as a foodstuff. Other name variations from country to country are caldo avá (Paraguay), tripas or mondongo (Dominican Republic), choncholi (Peru), chunchullo, chinchurria or chunchurria (Colombia), chinchurria (Venezuela), tripa mishqui (Ecuador) and tripa (Mexico).\n\nIn Mexico, tripas are considered a delicacy. They are very popular served as a guisado in tacos. They are cleaned, boiled, sliced, and then fried until crispy. They are often served with a spicy, tangy tomatillo-based salsa. In Guadalajara, along with the traditional preparation for tacos, they are often prepared as a dish, served with a specialized sauce in a bowl and accompanied by a stack of tortillas, additional complementary sauces, limes, and salt.\n\n\nChitterlings are also eaten as a dish in many East Asian cuisines.\n\nBoth large and small intestine (typically pig) is eaten throughout China. Large intestine is called \"feichang\", literally \"fat intestine\" because it is fatty. Small intestine is called \"zhufenchang\", literally \"pig powder intestine\" because it contains a white, pasty or powdery substance. The character \"zhu\" or \"pig\" is added at the beginning to disambiguate. This is because, in Cantonese cuisine, there is a dish called \"chang fen\" which uses intestine-shaped noodles.\n\nLarge intestine is typically chopped into rings and has a stronger odor than small intestine. It is added to stir-fry dishes and soups. It is also slow-cooked or boiled and served as a standalone dish. It releases oil that may be visible in the dish. Small intestine is normally chopped into tubes and may be simply boiled and served with a dipping sauce. Preparation techniques and serving presentations for both small and large intestine vary greatly within the country.\n\nIn Japan, chitterlings or \"motsu\" もつ are often fried and sold on skewers or \"kushi\" 串 in kushikatsu 串カツ or kushiage 串揚げ restaurants and street vendor pushcarts. It is also served as a soup called \"motsuni\" もつ煮 with miso, ginger, and finely chopped green onions to cut the smell, as well as other ingredients and internal organs such as the stomach and depending on the preparer. In Okinawa, the soup is called \"nakamijiru\" 中身汁 and served without miso as the chitterlings are put through a long cleaning process to get rid of the smell so it is not needed. In Nagoya it is called \"doteyaki\" どて焼き and is served with red miso and without the soup. In Fukuoka, it is called \"motsunabe\" もつ鍋 and is served as a nabe stew along with cabbage, chives, mungbean sprout, and tofu. In preparation of chitterlings for use, well-informed cooks feel the need to filter the potent aroma with white bread or a slice of potato on the rim of the cooking pot to keep their neighbors from just dropping in for a meal.　\n\nIn Korea, chitterlings (\"gopchang\") are grilled or used for stews (\"jeongol\") in Korea. When they are grilled, they are often accompanied by various seasonings and lettuce leaves (to wrap). Stew is cooked with various vegetables and seasonings.\n\nIn the Philippines, pig intestines (Filipino: \"bituka ng baboy\") are used in dishes such as \"dinuguan\" (pig blood stew). Grilled intestines are known as \"isaw\" and eaten as street food. Chicken intestines (\"isaw ng manok\", compared to \"isaw ng baboy\") are also used. Pig intestines are also prepared in a similar manner to pork rinds, known locally as \"chicharon\". Two distinct types of these are called \"chicharon bituka\" and \"chicharon bulaklak\", differing in the part of the intestine used.\n\nIn the United States, chitterlings are part of the Southern United States culinary tradition commonly called \"soul food\".\n\nChitterlings are carefully cleaned and rinsed several times before they are boiled or stewed for several hours. A common practice is to place a halved onion in the pot to mitigate the very unpleasant odor that can be particularly strong when the chitterlings begin to cook. Chitterlings sometimes are battered and fried after the stewing process and commonly are served with apple cider vinegar and hot sauce as condiments.\n\nWhen slavery was legal in America, slave owners commonly fed their slaves as cheaply as possible. At hog butchering time, the best cuts of meat were kept for the master's household and the remainder, such as fatback, snouts, ears, neck bones, feet, and intestines, were given to the slaves.\n\nIn 2003, the Smithsonian Institution's Anacostia Museum and Center for African American History and Culture accepted the papers of Shauna Anderson and her business, The Chitlin Market, as part of its emerging collection of materials about African American celebrations, foods and foodways.\n\nIn 1965, blues harmonica player and vocalist Junior Wells recorded a song, \"Chitlin Con Carne\" (compare for reference \"Chitlins Con Carne,\" a composition by jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell), on his acclaimed Delmark Records album, Hoodoo Man Blues. In 1991, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble also released a song under that title on \"The Sky Is Crying.\" Other notable blues songs with references to chitlins were recorded in 1929 by Peg Leg Howell (\"Chittlin' Supper\"), and in 1934 by the Memphis Jug Band (\"Rukus Juice and Chittlin'\"). Gus Jenkins, Johnny Otis, and Arthur Williams have also recorded songs with a reference to chitlins in their title.\n\nDisease can be spread by chitterlings not cleaned properly and undercooked. Pathogens include \"E. coli\", \"Yersinia enterocolitica\", and \"Salmonella\". Chitterlings are often soaked and rinsed thoroughly in several different cycles of cool water, and repeatedly picked clean by hand, removing extra fat, undigested food, and specks of feces. They may then be turned inside out, cleaned and boiled, sometimes in baking soda and/or salt, and the water discarded.\n\n"}
{"id": "489636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489636", "title": "Slava", "text": "Slava\n\nThe Slava (\"celebration\"; , ) is a Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition of the ritual glorification of one's family's patron saint. The family celebrates the Slava annually on the saint's feast day. Similar or identical traditions are found in different countries on the Balkans and not only among the Serbs, but also among other Slavic and non-Slavic groups, including Catholics and Muslims.\n\nIn November 2014 it was inscribed in UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nThe Slava is the family's annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint, a social event in which the family is together at the house of the patriarch. The Slava also brings friends to the house, regardless if they have the same Slava. The family saint is inherited from the patriarch (head of the household) – from father to son, while women do inherit the patron saint of their husbands upon leaving their families. As several patron saints are venerated twice a year, the main day is the \"Slava\", while the secondary one is called \"preslava\". Some families may celebrate another patron saint in the case when the wife is the only left of her kin, in respect to her family. In cases where the daughter's husband has joined (traditional) household of the parents-in-law (\"\"prizet\"\"/\"\"domazet\"\" = \"by-son-in-law\"/\"son-in-law-in-the-home\"), the wife's father's \"slava\" is celebrated as the main one (when guests are expected and/or invited) and the son-in-law's only as an additional lesser one (when just a festive meal is prepared for the family and no manual work is carried out, but no guests are expected).\n\nThe tradition is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity. Serbs usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn feast day. The tradition is also very well preserved among the Serb worldwide.\n\nBesides present day SerbiaIt, Slava is also common in some of the territories where Serbian medieval state extended its rule and cultural influence, but not only there. It is celebrated in Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and some parts of Dalmatia. Besides Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians, Slava can also be found among Catholics from Boka Kotorska, Konavle, Southern Herzegovina, Bosansko Grahovo, Janjevci, Christians in Northern Albania, and Muslims among Gorani and some Bosniaks in Bosnia and Sandžak. A similar tradition is found in Western Bulgaria, but also among some Vlachs, Aromanians etc.\n\nThe tradition has its origin in the Medieval Serbia, connected to Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the Serbs. There are indications that the institution of the slava dates from Saint Sava, that \"in his understanding and tactful approach to Serbian folk religion\", he \"seems to have found a compromise formula satisfactory to both his people's tradition and the requirements of Byzantine theology\". The slava is a reinterpretation of a pagan rite: the ancestor-protector became a Christian saint, frequently St. Nicholas, with the pagan rite being reduced of many religious elements and frequent ceremonies and becoming a social event with the annual meeting of the family and friends.\n\nAt the same time, there is an ongoing discussion in the Serbian historical and ethnological literature about the origin of the Slava, which has not yet been completed. According to some Serbian researchers, the thesis of how Slava is a purely Serbian fest is simply patriotic delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry.\n\nThe increased effective geographic mobility brought about by the post World War II urbanization of a previously highly agrarian society, combined with the brutal suppression of Serbian Orthodox traditions under the Communist rule, has made some aspects of the custom more relaxed. In particular, in the second half of the 20th century it became common to see traditional patriarchal families separated by great distances, so by necessity Slava came to occasionally be celebrated at more than one place by members of the same family.\n\nWhile the \"Slava\" kept something of a grassroots underground popularity during the Communist period, the post-Communist revival of Serbian Orthodox traditions has brought it a great resurgence. It is recognized as a distinctly (if not quite exclusively) Serbian custom, and today it is quite common for nonobservant Christians or even atheists to celebrate it in one form or another as a hereditary family holiday and a mark of ethnocultural identification.\n\nIn November 2014 it was inscribed in UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nThe custom is also helpful in genealogical studies as an indicator in kinship relations between families, tracing one's family to a specific region, etc.\n\nThe ritual foods that are prepared for the feast are the \"slavski kolač\" (or simply \"kolač\") = a ritual bread, and \"koljivo\" (or \"žito\"), a dish of minced boiled wheat, sweetened and sometimes mixed with chopped walnuts. The top of the \"kolač\" is adorned with the Christian cross, the peace dove, and other symbols. The \"koljivo\" is a symbol of the Resurrection of Christ (cf. \"if the grain does not die...\" in the Gospel) and partaken in memory of the dead (deceased family members). \n\nThe rest of the feast consists of a meal, the contents of which depends on whether or not the celebration falls in a period of fasting. During a fast (\"posno\"), the meal would not contain any meat other than fish or other seafood, and would be highly unlikely to contain eggs or dairy products. Outside of a fasting period, these restrictions would not apply (\"mrsno\"). Thus, colloquially, \"slavas\" can be referred to as \"posna\" or \"mrsna\". Appropriately-made sweets are consumed, as well.\n\nThe family attends church services and partakes in Holy Communion on the feast day. Following the service, traditionally, the parish priest is received in the family's home or the family brings the \"slavski kolač\" to the church. The parish priest performs a small service which entails venerating the patron saint's memory, blessing the \"kolač\" and \"koljivo\", as well as lighting the \"\"slava\" candle\". Though not necessary, it is common for the priest to bless the house and perform a small memorial service for dead relatives.\n\nThe most common feast days are St. Nicholas (\"Nikoljdan\", 19 December), St. George (\"Đurđevdan\", 6 May), St. John the Baptist (\"Jovanjdan\", 20 January), St. Demetrius (\"Mitrovdan\", 8 November), St. Michael (\"Aranđelovdan\", 21 November) and St. Sava (\"Savindan\", 27 January). Dates given are according to the Gregorian calendar. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar.\n\nMany Serbian communities (villages, cities, organizations, political parties, institutions, companies, professions) also celebrate their patron saint. For example, the city of Belgrade celebrates the Ascension of Jesus Christ as its patronal feast.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "489992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489992", "title": "Diving mask", "text": "Diving mask\n\nA diving mask (also half mask, dive mask or scuba mask) is an item of diving equipment that allows underwater divers, including scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers, to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is in direct contact with water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light on the retina. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, the eye is able to focus nearly normally. The shape of the air space in the mask slightly affects the ability to focus. Corrective lenses can be fitted to the inside surface of the viewport or contact lenses may be worn inside the mask to allow normal vision for people with focusing defects.\n\nWhen the diver descends, the ambient pressure rises, and it becomes necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the external ambient pressure to avoid the barotrauma known as mask squeeze, This is done by allowing sufficient air to flow out through the nose into the mask to relieve the pressure difference. This requires the nose to be included in the airspace of the mask. Equalisation during ascent is automatic as excess air inside the mask easily leaks out past the seal.\n\nA wide range of viewport shapes and internal volumes are available, and each design will generally fit some shapes of face better than others. A good comfortable fit and a reliable seal around the edges of the rubber skirt is important to the correct function of the mask.\n\nEight national and international standards relating to diving masks are known to exist: British standard BS 4532:1969 (amended 1977); USSR and CIS standard GOST 20568—75 (Active); German standard DIN 7877:1980; American national standard ANSI Z87.11:1985 (Active); Austrian standard ÖNORM S 4224:1988; Chinese national standard CNS 12497:1989 (Active); Chinese national standard CNS 12498:1989 (Active); and European standard EN 16805:2015 (Active).\n\nLight rays bend when they travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.\n\nBy wearing a flat diving mask, humans can see clearly under water. The scuba mask's flat window separates the eyes from the surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) in a manner similar to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.\n\nRefraction of light entering the mask makes objects appear about 34% bigger and 25% nearer when underwater. Also pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration are noticeable. As the diver descends in clean water, the water acts as a colour filter eliminating the red end of the visible spectrum of the sunlight entering the water leaving only the blue end of the spectrum. Depending on the depth and clarity of the water, eventually all sunlight is blocked and the diver has to rely on artificial light sources to see underwater.\n\nThere are two basic categories of diving mask: The half mask covers the eyes and nose, and the full face mask covers eyes, nose and mouth, and therefore includes a part of the breathing apparatus. The half mask is described here.\n\nDiving masks may have a single, durable, tempered glass faceplate, or two lenses in front of the eyes. These may be supported by a relatively rigid plastic or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as \"frameless\". In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. There is usually a \"skirt\" of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a watertight seal with the diver's face.\nThe skirt material may be almost transparent, translucent or opaque. A nearly transparent skirt provides a greater peripheral vision, though somewhat distorted, and may reduce the feeling of claustrophobia in some divers, but in some cases the light entering through the sides may cause distracting internal reflections. The skirt also encloses the nose, usually by means of a nose pocket, so that air can be exhaled through the nose into the mask to equalise the internal pressure during descent and thereby avoid possible barotrauma of the enclosed area of the face. The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while equalising pressure in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap at the back of the head for stability and comfort.\n\nSome masks had a one-way purge valve under the nose to let water out, but this is no longer common as they were neither necessary nor reliable, and often leaked.\n\nDiving masks can be fitted with prescription lenses for divers needing optical correction to improve vision. Corrective lenses are ground flat on one side and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and below the surface of the water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard corrective lenses are available which can be fitted. Plastic self-adhesive lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask is dislodged in turbulent water.\n\nA mask is considered to fit well when it seals comfortably and effectively all round the skirt, and provides a good field of vision, without pressing on the nose or forehead while in use underwater. A low internal volume is considered desirable by freedivers, as less breath is wasted to equalise, and by scuba divers, as there is less tendency to press up under the nose due to buoyancy, which becomes uncomfortable quite quickly.\n\nDivers may test whether a mask is a good fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this indicates that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under the edge of the seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.\n\nThe strap can be adjusted to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of the strap around the back of the head will reduce the risk of dislodging and facilitate clearing.\n\nWhen entering the water while wearing the mask, the diver may need to manually prevent water impact from dislodging or knocking off the mask. Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with the mask off and then put it on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over the mask. Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while out of the water or on the surface increases the risk of the mask falling or being knocked off.\n\nTo prevent a mask from fogging up due to condensation on the glass many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of the plate and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used as an alternative to the saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.\n\nStandard maintenance is to rinse inside and out with clean, fresh water after each day's use, and allow to dry out of direct sunlight before storage. Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years. The strap is the most stressed component and is often the first part to fail, but can usually be replaced. Inspection of the strap for cracks and tears before use can reduce the risk of failure during a dive.\n\nMask removal and refitting underwater and clearing are basic skills that all divers must learn so that they can deal with flooding and leaks or the mask being dislodged without panic.\n\nIt is quite common for water to leak into the mask, which can be annoying, or interfere with clear vision, and the diver needs to be able to get rid of the water quickly and effectively. Reasons for the leakage include poor fit or fitting, leaking via head or facial hair, movement of the facial muscles causing temporary leaks, or impact of external objects against the mask, which may distort it temporarily, or move it so that it leaks, or in extreme cases dislodge it entirely from the diver's head.\n\nThe methods of clearing differ between the half mask, which covers the eyes and nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It may be necessary to press the upper part of the mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.\n\nThe pressure changes during ascent and descent may affect gas spaces in the diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands during ascent, but have to be equalized during compression of descent.\n\nEqualising of the mask is an essential skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need to pinch the nostrils closed as part of their equalisation technique, and this must be allowed for in the design of the mask skirt.\n\nEarly model diving masks had a single elliptical pane of glass. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom on either side of the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a Valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.\n\nA further development is the mask with two windows, one for each eye. It can have the windows closer to the face than the one-window type, and therefore contain even less internal volume for the diver to clear or equalise. These types are often called a \"low-volume mask\". Participants in the sport of underwater hockey are required to use twin-lens masks of this type for their own safety - the sport uses a heavy lead puck similar to an ice hockey puck, nan but skilful players can flick the puck considerable height off the bottom when making passes which leads to the possibility of accidental puck contact with other players. Should a puck hit the lens of a single-lens mask there is a good chance it will break the glass and pass through the aperture to hit the face and eyes, but with a twin-lens mask though the glass may break the frame will prevent the passage of the puck any further.\n\nRecent innovations have produced more complex designs, intended to provide extra features:\n\nThere are several specialised types of diving headgear or outerwear:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "490100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490100", "title": "Poon choi", "text": "Poon choi\n\nPoon choi or puhn choi (pronounced: pun4 coi3 in Cantonese), also pen cai in pinyin, is a traditional Cantonese dish once common throughout Southern China. It first spread to the walled villages in New Territories, Hong Kong, and then to the rest of the territory. It is a Cantonese cuisine served in large wooden, porcelain or metal basins due to the communal style of consumption. The Chinese name, transliterated as Poon choi, has been variously translated as \"big bowl feast\", \"basin cuisine\" or \"Chinese casserole\".\n\nAccording to tradition, Poon choi was invented during the late Song Dynasty. When Mongol troops invaded Song China, the young Emperor fled to the area around Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. To serve the Emperor as well as his army, the locals collected all their best food available, cooked it, and because there were not enough serving containers available put the resulting meal in large wooden washbasins.\n\nIn any event, Poon choi is associated with the early settlers of the New Territories, who had been driven south of the mainland by a series of barbarian invasions in China between the 13th and 17th centuries.\n\nWalled village culture is well preserved in the New Territories and Poon choi gradually became a traditional dish of the walled villages. As Poon choi is a large dish portioned to be suitable for a communal meal, it was served whenever there were celebrations connected with rituals, weddings, festivals, ancestor worship and other local events as an expression of village dining culture.\n\nPoon Choi includes ingredients such as pork, beef, lamb, chicken, duck, abalone, ginseng, shark fin, fish maw, prawn, crab, dried mushroom, fishballs, squid, dried eel, dried shrimp, pigskin, bean curd and Chinese white radish.\n\nOut of respect to their guests the villagers put only a relatively small amount of vegetables in Poon choi. To walled villagers, vegetables are not highly valued ingredients. In order to offer the best food during important annual events, villagers prefer to include mostly meat and seafood in Poon choi.\n\nThree days are traditionally required for preparing and cooking the meal.\n\nThe first day: A trip to the mountains is required to gather firewood, which must be chopped to size. \nIn ancient times when people did not have liquefied petroleum gas, plenty of firewood had to be available to cook all the food. Today, there are still many walled villages that adhere to the use of wood for fuel because the residents believe that liquefied petroleum gas is less strong and does not supply as much heat or last as long as firewood. Only a wood fire is believed to produce the real flavour of the dish.\n\nThe second day: Buy plenty of fresh ingredients\nThe walled village uses fresh ingredients, rarely frozen or refrigerated products, to make Poon choi. This is not only because these rural communities do not have refrigerators. It is also believed that only fresh ingredients can produce fresh and delicious Poon choi. Because traditional Poon choi is used for festive banquets in ancestral halls it is considered disrespectful to the ancestors and gods if canned, frozen, or ready-to-eat products are used in its preparation.\n\nThe third day: Stew the pork\nIt takes a full day to achieve the desired taste so the stewing of the pork starts early in the morning. The Ancients cooked Weitou pork for at least 10 hours in order for the ‘half fat-thin’ pork bellies to become tender and tasty.\n\nA few decades ago, preparing Poon choi was considered a test for chefs because the long cooking time on a wooden stove required a great deal of patience and stove control.\n\nAttentive layering of the ingredients contributes to the taste of the whole dish.\n\nAppearance\nPoon choi is special in that it is composed of many layers of different ingredients. Traditionally, it is also eaten layer by layer instead of first \"stirring everything up\", although impatient diners may first snatch the popular daikon radish at the bottom with the help of the shared serving chopsticks.\n\nIngredients such as Chinese radishes, pigskins and bean curd are placed in the bottom of the container. In the middle of the dish there are usually pork and Chinese dried mushrooms. On the top, meat, seafood, and rare ingredients like abalone and sea cucumber are to be found.\n\nIt contributes to the attractiveness of Poon choi if dried noodles with egg are put on top to symbolise a crown.\n\nTaste\nRelatively dry ingredients such as seafood are placed on the top while other ingredients that can absorb sauce well are assigned to the bottom of the basin. This allows sauces to flow down to the bottom of the basin as people start eating from the top.\n\nPoon choi is often served during religious rituals, festivals, special occasions and wedding banquets in the open areas of villages. From the 1990s, It became popular among urban dwellers as well and it can be enjoyed at many Cantonese restaurants in the autumn and winter or on special occasions throughout the year.\n\n1. Showing gratitude to ancestors\nThe fact that villagers use only the best and freshest ingredients is a way they pay respect to their ancestors. This behaviour illustrates the character of traditional Chinese people, who keep their ancestors in mind and remain grateful to them. It also reflects their reputation of being very hospitable.\n\n2. Teamwork and unity\nPoon choi requires lots of manpower to prepare and cook the ingredients. So whenever there are any major events, respected villagers become the main chefs, leading and instructing the rest of the village in preparing the meal. In other words, cooking Poon choi requires teamwork among villagers, which unites them.\n\n3. Family lineages\nIt is also noteworthy that different walled villages have different cooking method for preparing Poon choi in keeping with their own customs. The Poon choi recipes of every village are kept secret and not divulged to people who do not belong to the village. The recipe is regarded as a village inheritance passed from villager to villager and father to son over generations. Poon choi is thus a symbol of the continuity of the village and local family lineages.\n\n4. Equality\nEnjoying Poon choi demonstrates equality because the rich and the poor eat it together. There is no complicated etiquette, everyone can join in.\n\n5. Signaling\nIf villagers do not hold a Poon choi feast, it means, for example, that a village does not approve of or accept a particular marriage.\n\nTraditional Poon choi is served in a big wooden basin. There is one on each table and every person at the table takes food from the basin, layer by layer, from the top to the bottom.\n\nToday, people use 'Gun Fai' (clean chopsticks used to move food from serving basin to personal bowl) to get the food. This more hygienic practice allows the diner to pick out particular pieces of food from the bottom of the serving basin as well. It is also becoming more acceptable to use these chopsticks to mix and turn over the food. Symbolic meanings are attached to this new custom: it causes people to work together, and it is an attempt to encourage fortune and luck coming to them.\n\nPoon choi is a traditional food system in the walled villages. Whether it is festival celebration or worship ancestors, it is related to Poon choi. The villagers' gathering of basin meal is a crucial process in “confirmation of identity\". Any family with a boy newly born will light up a lamp in the ancestral hall and invite the villagers to participate in the “lamp gathering\", that is a Poon choi feast to celebrate the new male. After the ceremony was completed, the newborn male was officially recognized as a member of the village and had the right to inherit the property. As for the wedding tradition, the couple will raise a day to invite relatives to the Poon choi feast, which implies they are recognized the marriage. Also, after the spring and autumn ancestral worship, they reunited and ate Poon choi together.\n\nThe Poon choi is symbolized to \"unity\". In the tradational Poon choi feast, people are not sent the invitation cards to the villagers. Only a red notice of the Poon Choi feast will be posted at the door of the village, their relatives and friends will naturally come to this festival. The villagers used the Poon choi feast to reach the whole village without any distinction, becoming an individual, united and harmonious. This symbolic meaning has been passed down to the present day, Poon choi is no longer limited in the walled village. It has been widely developed in Hong Kong, people will eat Poon choi during the Chinese New Year and other dinner party.\n\nPoon choi meals are becoming more and more popular, one of the reasons being promotion by mass media, which widely publicise Poon choi events, such as the 1997 large-scale Poon choi banquet, and the Poon Choi banquet held by Heung Yee Kuk. Another reason is the economic downturn. Since Poon choi contains a large amount of many ingredients, Hong Kong people think the cost is lower than other types of restaurant meals. Poon choi also represents Hong Kong’s food culture and creativity. Although it is a traditional cuisine of Hong Kong walled villages the ingredients have changed over the past decades and become more diversified to suit peoples' varying palates and tastes.\n\nNowadays, Poon Choi stores are being launched in the urban districts. To maintain their competitiveness, these stores provide various conveniences and varieties to fulfill consumer needs and wants. They also invest the name Poon choi with meanings mostly symbolic of fortune as a gimmick to attract people.\n\nIn the past, citizens had to take the time to visit the walled villages in order to enjoy Poon choi. It was of course also a valuable opportunity for them to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a while.\n\nNowadays, eating Poon choi is not only limited to people living in or visiting walled villages. During festivals, urban citizens can now enjoy Poon choi from ubiquitous Chinese fast food restaurant, such as Café de Coral, Fairwood. Even when it is not festival time, residents can also purchase Poon choi in some specialised stores, like 八味香帝皇盆菜專門店, 洪運正宗盆菜, Seamart, etc. Therefore, Poon choi has become a meal that people can enjoy anywhere and anytime.\n\nIn 2003, a Poon choi feast was held in the former Kai Tak airport. It had 660 tables, seating 12 people per table; together with the staff a total of nearly ten thousand people participated. This event broke the world record for the highest number of people gathered to eating Poon choi.\n\nDelivery service is provided so that the stores can ensure that all people, especially those living far away, can enjoy Poon choi and purchase it from their stores. Delivery service is no doubt convenient when there are activities organised by local organisations or the government which feature a Poon choi feast. As these customers order bulk amounts, the stores give discounts or provide free materials, like tables, a gas stove, and tableware together with the Poon choi.\n\nOrdering by phone or online enables customers to conveniently order Poon choi, since it eliminate the need for them to take time to visit the stores. The stores immediately start preparation once they have received the order, increasing efficiency.\n\nThe advertising leaflets from these stores usually offer customers a choice of big, medium and small amounts of Poon choi. With standard quantities and prices, people can easily determine how much they wish to order. Standardisation also reduces conflicts between the store and customers.\n\nAt present, stores use an aluminium foil cover to retain the heat of the wrapped Poon choi. Together with a large plastic bag with handles to bear the weight, this meal can easily be transported. No doubt these innovations ease the burden on customers in a hurry.\n\nDifferent from traditional reheating methods, nowadays restaurants use a portable gas stove to warm the Poon choi before it is served. It can also be used at a table to maintain the warmth continuously and hence guarantee the quality and taste.\n\nIn the past, people ate Poon choi with rice only, but now they have more choices. They may choose other carbohydrates, like noodles or udon, depending on their eating habits.\n\nProviding a variety of price categories allows people also to choose the diversity of delicacies which they can afford. Relatively high priced Poon choi includes luxury food such as abalones, shark fin, oyster, which people may select to gain honour by showing that they are generous and wealthy. Those who prefer a reasonable price can have a tasty meal with more common ingredients.\n\nAs an international hub, Hong Kong can provide diners with a variety of flavours. There is now available Japanese Poon choi, curry Poon choi, Western Poon choi, and vegetarian Poon choi, all in a bid to fulfill different needs and wants of customers, whether locals or tourists.\n\n"}

The name is derived from Portuguese \"Pão de Castela\", meaning \"bread from Castile\". Castella cake is usually sold in long boxes, with the cake inside being approximately 27 cm long. It is somewhat similar to Madeira cake, also associated with Portugal, but its closest relative is \"pão-de-ló\", also a Portuguese cake.\n\nThere are similar types of sponge cakes named after the same fashion, in , in , in Portuguese: Pão de Espanha, in , in , in , in . (Castile was a former kingdom of Spain, comprising its north-central provinces, thus \"Pain d'Espagne\" and other variants are quasi-synonymous to \"bread from Castile\"). A similar cake, called \"taisan\", is a traditional dessert in Pampanga province in the Philippines. \n\nIn the 16th century, the Portuguese reached Japan and soon started trade and missionary work. Nagasaki was then the only Japanese port open for foreign commerce. The Portuguese introduced many then-unusual things, such as guns, tobacco, and pumpkins. The cake could be stored for a long period of time, and so was useful for the sailors who were out on the sea for months. In the Edo period, in part due to the cost of sugar, castella was an expensive dessert to make despite the ingredients sold by the Portuguese. When the Emperor of Japan's envoy was invited, the Tokugawa shogunate presented the Castella. Over the years, the taste changed to suit Japanese palates.\n\nThere are now many varieties made with ingredients such as powdered green tea, brown sugar, and honey. They may be molded in various shapes; a popular Japanese festival food is \"baby castella\", a bite-sized version.\n\n\"Siberia\", castella cake filled with youkan (sweet bean jelly), was popular in the Meiji era; it had a resurgence since it appeared in the 2013 animated film \"The Wind Rises,\" by Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nCastella mix is used for the pancakes that are sandwiched together with sweet adzuki bean paste in the confection known as \"dorayaki\".\n\nCastella were first introduced to Taiwan in 1871, during the age of Taiwan under Japanese rule. In 1968, Ye Yongqing, the owner of a Japanese bakery in Taipei named \"Nanbanto\", partnered with the Japanese company \"Nagasaki Honpu\"to establish \"Hometown of One\", Taiwan’s first shop specializing in castella. This shop adapted the recipe to better suit Taiwanese tastes, creating varieties that incorporated Taiwanese Longan honey and Japanese cheese. With these changes and with heavy promotion, castella quickly became a favourite amongst the Taiwanese people.\n\nThe most popular variety of castella in Taiwan is \"Honey Castella\". Honey is not a necessary ingredient in the original Japanese recipe, and honey castella are therefore uncommon in Japan. However, in Taiwan, customers prefer this modified version of castella, which has a strong scent of thick honey.\n\nAnother Taiwanese variety, \"rock-baked castella\" is a double-baked cake in a circular shape, with a honey castella base and a cheese-based topping. They are usually more expensive than \"honey castella\".\n\n\n"}

Cycling jerseys of specific color or pattern represent certain statuses in cycling, such as the yellow jersey of the leader of the general classification in the Tour de France, or the rainbow jersey for the world champion. Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic microfiber material to aid in wicking sweat away from the skin to allow it to evaporate. The main garment of an ice hockey uniform, which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a hockey jersey. This garment, along with basketball jerseys which are usually sleeveless and baseball jerseys which are usually button up, have become fashion accessories. A related term is \"bib\", which may refer to a shirt (jersey, esp. in Britain). In Australian rules football, the player's shirt is known as a \"guernsey\".\n\nIn some sports, such as ice hockey, baseball, basketball, and various football codes, a player's jersey may be \"retired\". When a jersey is retired, that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honor of that player's accomplishment. Generally, when a jersey is retired, the number on the player's jersey is made unavailable for future players.\n\n"}

{"id": "493399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493399", "title": "Loudness", "text": "Loudness\n\nIn acoustics, loudness is the subjective perception of sound pressure. More formally, it is defined as, \"That attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud.\" The relation of physical attributes of sound to perceived loudness consists of physical, physiological and psychological components. The study of apparent loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics.\n\nIn different industries, loudness may have different meanings and different measurement standards. Some definitions, such as ITU-R BS.1770 refer to relative loudness of different segments of electronically reproduced sounds, such as for broadcasting and cinema. Others, such as ISO 532A (Stevens loudness, measured in sones), ISO 532B (Zwicker loudness), DIN 45631 and ASA/ANSI S3.4, have a more general scope and are often used to characterize loudness of environmental noise.\n\nLoudness, a subjective measure, often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. Filters such as A-weighting and LKFS attempt to compensate measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the typical human.\n\nThe perception of loudness is related to sound pressure level (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound. The relationship between SPL and loudness of a single tone can be approximated by Stevens's power law in which SPL has an exponent of 0.67. More precise measurements indicate that loudness increases with a higher exponent at low and high levels and with a lower exponent at moderate levels.\n\nThe sensitivity of the human ear changes as a function of frequency, as shown in the equal-loudness graph. Each line on this graph shows the SPL required for frequencies to be perceived as equally loud, and different curves pertain to different sound pressure levels. It also shows that humans with normal hearing are most sensitive to sounds around 2–4 kHz, with sensitivity declining to either side of this region. A complete model of the perception of loudness will include the integration of SPL by frequency.\n\nHistorically, loudness was measured using an \"ear-balance\" audiometer in which the amplitude of a sine wave was adjusted by the user to equal the perceived loudness of the sound being evaluated. Contemporary standards for measurement of loudness are based on summation of energy in critical bands.\n\nWhen sensorineural hearing loss (damage to the cochlea or in the brain) is present, the perception of loudness is altered. Sounds at low levels (often perceived by those without hearing loss as relatively quiet) are no longer audible to the hearing impaired, but sounds at high levels often are perceived as having the same loudness as they would for an unimpaired listener. This phenomenon can be explained by two theories, called \"loudness recruitment\" and \"softness imperception\".\n\nLoudness recruitment posits that loudness grows more rapidly for certain listeners than normal listeners with changes in level. This theory has been accepted as the classical explanation.\n\nSoftness imperception, a term coined by Mary Florentine around 2002, proposes that some listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may exhibit a normal rate of loudness growth, but instead have an elevated loudness at their threshold. That is, the softest sound that is audible to these listeners is louder than the softest sound audible to normal listeners.\n\nThe \"loudness\" control associated with a loudness compensation feature on some consumer stereos alters the frequency response curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness characteristic of the ear. Loudness compensation is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.\n\nLoudness normalization is a specific type of audio normalization that equalizes perceived level such that, for instance, commercials do not sound louder than television programs. Loudness normalization schemes exist for a number of audio applications.\n\n\n\n\nHistorically Sone (loudness \"N\") and Phon (loudness level \"L\") units have been used to measure loudness.\n\nA-weighting follows human sensitivity to sound and describes relative perceived loudness for at quiet to moderate speech levels, around 40 phons.\n\nRelative loudness monitoring in production is measured in accordance with ITU-R BS.1770 in units of LKFS.\n\nWork began on ITU-R BS.1770 in 2001 after 0 dBFS+ level distortion in converters and lossy codecs had become evident; and the original Leq(RLB) loudness metric was proposed by Gilbert Soulodre in 2003. Based on data from subjective listening tests, Leq(RLB) compared favorably to numerous other algorithms. CBC, Dolby and TC Electronic and numerous broadcasters contributed to the listening tests. \n\nLoudness levels measured according to the Leq(RLB) specified in ITU-R BS.1770 are reported in LKFS units. \n\nThe ITU-R BS.1770 measurement system was improved for made multi-channel applications (monaural to 5.1 surround sound). To make the loudness metric cross-genre friendly, a relative measurement gate was added. This work was carried out in 2008 by the EBU. The improvements were brought back into BS.1770-2. ITU subsequently updated the true-peak metric (BS.1770-3) and added provision for even more audio channels, for instance 22.2 surround sound (BS.1770-4).\n\n"}

This technique for producing candy was introduced to Japan in the early 16th century by Portuguese traders. The infrastructure and refining technology of sugar had not yet been established in Japan in those days. As uses a lot of sugar, it was very rare and expensive as a result.

Originally, the core was a poppy seed. The process is somewhat similar to the \"dragée\" process, except the candies are produced by being ladled with sugar syrup and rotated slowly in a large heated gong-shaped tub called a \"dora\". Each grain of the core sugar grows over the course of several days with the continued rotating, heating, and application of syrup, becoming a ball covered with tiny bulges. It usually takes 7–13 days to make \"konpeitō\", and they are crafted by artisans even today.\n\nThe Star Bits in \"Super Mario Galaxy\", the Gratitude Crystals in \"\", and Minior, as well as Max Revives (and to a lesser extent, Revives) and Cosmog's star candies from the \"Pokémon\" series, are all based on these candies. \"Super Mario RPG\" also features it as an attack item that was localized as \"Rock Candy\". They can also be seen in the 2001 Japanese animated film \"Spirited Away\", as well as in various anime, such as \"Bleach\", \"Hamtaro\", \"Wish Upon the Pleiades\", \"Sailor Moon\", \"Kobato\", \"Happy Sugar Life\", and \"Stellvia\".\n\nThey feature as a key element in the 2017 film \"Honnōji Hotel\".\n\nIn the Anime \"Kobato\", the sweet and naïve Hanato Kobato comes to Earth on a mission to collect and fill a bottle with \"konpeito\", which appear after healing a person's heart that is suffering.\n\nIn Season 1 of \"Hamtaro\", Laura introduces Hamtaro to konpeito-shaped candies called Diamonds of Sugar.

{"id": "496821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496821", "title": "Rendang", "text": "Rendang\n\nRendang is a Southeast Asian spicy meat dish, which originated in Indonesia, especially the ethnic group of Minangkabau people, and is now commonly served across the country. One of the characteristic foods of Minangkabau culture, it is served at ceremonial occasions and to honour guests. Rendang is also served among the Malay community. Rendang is traditionally prepared by the Minangkabau community during festive occasions such as traditional ceremonies, wedding feasts and \"Hari Raya\" (Eid al-Fitr).\n\nAlthough culinary experts often describe rendang as a curry, rendang is usually not considered as such in Indonesia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for Indonesian curries. In 2011 an online poll of 35,000 people by CNN International chose rendang as the number one dish of their \"World's 50 Most Delicious Foods (Readers' Pick)\" list. In 2018, \"rendang\" is officially recognised as one of 5 national dishes of Indonesia.\n\nThe cooking technique flourished because of its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate. Prior to refrigeration technology, this style of cooking enabled preservation of the large amount of meat.\n\nRendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk and a paste of mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis and other spices. This spice mixture is called \"pemasak\" in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives. If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks.\n\nTraditionally the term \"rendang\" does not refer to a certain type of dish. The verb \"merendang\" actually refers to a method of slow cooking; continuously churning the ingredients in a pot or frying pan, on a small fire, until all of the liquids evaporate and the meat is well done. Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is time-consuming and requires patience. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to become tender and absorb the condiments. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying as the liquid evaporates. Cooking the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care, keeping it from not getting burnt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and unique taste.\n\nRendang is often served with steamed rice, \"ketupat\" (a compressed rice cake) or \"lemang\" (glutinous rice cooked in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, \"cubadak\" (young jackfruit \"gulai\"), cabbage \"gulai\" and \"lado\" (red or green chilli pepper sambal).\n\nRendang is revered in Minangkabau culture as an embodiment of the philosophy of \"musyawarah\", discussion and consultation with elders. It has been claimed that the four main ingredients represent Minangkabau society as a whole:\nIn Minangkabau tradition, rendang is a requisite dish for special occasions in traditional Minang ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to circumcision, marriage, Qur'an recitals, and religious festivals such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.\n\nRendang originated in the Sumatran Minangkabau region. One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the early 16th century literary work, Hikayat Amir Hamzah. The making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau region to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.\n\nThe popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the \"merantau\" (migrating) culture of Minangkabau people. Overseas Minangkabau leave their home town to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighbouring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.\n\nAndalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\" The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.\n\nIn Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: \"Gulai — Kalio — Rendang\". The ingredients of \"gulai\", \"kalio\" and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that \"gulai\" usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\n\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called \"gulai\". If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called \"kalio\". For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: \"gulai\" is light yellow, \"kalio\" is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\n\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume. It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.\n\nWet rendang, more accurately identified as \"kalio\", is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, \"kalio\" lasts less than a week. Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.\n\nOutside of its native land in Minangkabau, rendang is also known in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and southern Thailand. Most Malaysian rendang is more like \"kalio\", lighter in colour and taste when compared with its Minangkabau counterpart. Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as the Kelantanese rendang and the Negri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods and use \"kerisik\" (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice, instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia, the \"rendang Tok\" variant, found in the state of Perak, is a dry one.\n\nOther ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example in Java, the rendang — aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants — tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet \"kalio\" version in the Netherlands — usually as part of a \"rijsttafel\".\n\nRendang is made from beef (or occasionally beef liver, chicken, mutton, water buffalo, duck, or vegetables like jackfruit or cassava). Chicken or duck rendang also contains tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.\n\nThe original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, \"rendang darek\" and \"rendang pesisir\". \"Rendang darek\" (‘land rendang’) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as Batusangkar, Agam, Lima Puluh Kota, Payakumbuh, Padang Panjang and Bukittinggi. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. \"Rendang pesisir\" (‘coastal rendang’) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. \"Rendang pesisir\" mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.\n\nIndonesian Rendang variations:\n\nRendang \"bumbu\" is sometimes used as the base of other fusion dishes. Some chefs in Indonesian sushi establishments for example, have developed a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine with recipes for krakatau roll, gado-gado roll, rendang roll and gulai ramen. Several chefs and food industries have experimented with fusing rendang with sandwiches, burgers and spaghetti. Burger King at one time served their take on a rendang-flavoured burger in their Singapore and Indonesia chains for a limited promotion period. Spaghetti with rendang could also be found in 7-Eleven convenience stores across Indonesia. Rendang is also a popular flavour in Indonesian instant noodle variants, such as the \"Indomie Goreng Rendang\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "496877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496877", "title": "Distance line", "text": "Distance line\n\nA distance line, penetration line, cave line or guide line is an item of diving equipment used by scuba divers as a means of returning to a safe starting point in conditions of low visibility, water currents or where pilotage is difficult. They are often used in cave diving and wreck diving where the diver must return to open water after a penetration when it may be difficult to discern the return route. Guidelines are also useful in the event of silt out.\nDistance lines are wound on to a spool or a reel. The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a surface marker buoy may only need , whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from to 1000+ ft (300 m).\n\nReels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy surface marker buoys and decompression buoys and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a shotline or boat anchor.\n\nThe material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, nylon being the material of choice for cave diving. A common line used is polypropylene line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant.\n\nThe use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.\n\nCave diving: Guide lines are used in cave diving as standard procedure whenever it is possible that the divers may be confused about the way out. In effect, this is in any dive where there is no free surface overhead and where daylight is not visible at all points of the dive. By the most common definition of cave diving, this would mean guide lines should be used for all cave dives.\n\nWreck diving: The use of guidelines in wreck diving is very similar to their use in cave diving.\n\nDiving in low visibility: A guideline may be used for dives where poor visibility may make it difficult to return to the starting point, and there is a safety or operational requirement to return to that point.\n\nOther dives where it is necessary or highly desirable to return to a starting point: This may include dives where a shot line or anchor line is to be used for ascent, and other dives where a specific exit point is chosen for safety or convenience. Working divers may use a guide line to allow confident and efficient movement to, from and around the workplace. This may also be referred to as a jackstay. In these applications the guideline is generally more for efficiency than for safety, but it may also help the divers stay away from potentially hazardous areas.\n\nGuidelines may also be used as a means of directing tourists around a dive site, between points of interest which may be difficult to find without the line. This form of guideline may be permanently placed.\n\n\n\nA reel comprises a spool with a winding knob, which rotates on an axle, attached to a frame, with a handle to hold the assembly in position while in use. A line guide is almost always present, and there us usually a method of clipping the reel to the diver's harness when not in use.\nOther accessories which may be present (usually not all on the same reel) include:\n\nReels may be made from a wide variety of materials, but near neutral buoyancy and resistance to impact damage are desirable features, which are easiest to achieve in engineering polymers such as nylon, acetal (delrin) and polyethylene.\n\nReels may also be open or closed. This refers to the presence of a cover around the spool, which is intended to reduce the risk of line tangles on the spool, or line flipping over the side and causing a jam. To some extent this works, but if there is a jam the cover effectively prevents the diver from correcting it. Open reels allow easy access to free jams caused by overwinds or line getting caught between spool and handle.\n\nFinger spools are a simple, compact low tech alternative to reels best suited to relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular flanges with a hole in the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is secured by clipping a bolt snap through a hole on one of the flanges and over the line as it leaves the reel. Line is reeled in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.\nSpools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.\n\nExploration reels are large reels that can hold a lot of line, in some cases as much as , and are used during major exploration dives where this length is needed. They tend to be bulky and impractical for most purposes.\n\nPenetration reels (also known as primary or lead reels) are used to run line from a point with direct access to the surface to the start of a permanent line. This may be as much as a few hundred feet into the overhead. These reels will usually carry of line. These reels are also used for short penetrations where there is no permanent line.\n\nJump and gap spools are used to bridge gaps between two permanent guide lines. Line length is generally about \n\nSafety spools are used in emergencies such as line breaks, searches for a lost guideline or lost diver. They generally carry about of line, and one should be carried by each diver. They are not intended for use under an overhead except in an emergency.\n\nLine markers are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a \"jump\" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point on the line where the diver is equidistant from two exits.\n\nNon-directional markers (\"cookies\") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.\n\nSilt screws are pegs which are inserted into soft bottom sediments to tie off the guide line when there are no suitable natural formations. A common style of silt screw is a length of rigid PVC tube cut to a point at one end, with a notch at the other to secure a wrap. These are lightweight and durable, and are easily transported by attaching them to a cylinder with bungees.\n\nProcedures associated with the use of guide lines include primary and secondary tie-off, laying line, positioning line, following line, marking and identifying line, identifying jumps and exit directions, searching for a lost line, repairing a break, and recovering line.\n\nMost reels are designed to be held in the left hand, particularly for recovering line. Line should be kept under tension at all times to avoid slack which is more likely to snag on divers' equipment. An adjustable brake may be used to provide resistance to rotation, or this can be done by pressing a thumb or finger against the spool as it rotates, which is quick and controllable, but requires some attention, and fails if the reel is dropped. The line should be kept clear of the divers body during the laying to reduce risk of snagging on the diver's equipment. This can be achieved by holding the reel away from the body in clear water.\n\nThe line should be laid so that it can be followed in the worst possible visibility, and allow for other emergency procedures such as gas sharing at the time. This generally means that the divers must be able to follow it by feel.\n\nLine traps are places that a line can pass through but are too tight for a diver, making it impossible to follow the line by feel. Avoiding line traps is a large part of the skill of laying line, and generally require the line to be tied off in such a way that it does not enter line trap areas when under the necessary tension to prevent slack. As a general principle, this requires the line to be secured at any change of direction, by a \"placement\" or a \"tie-off.\"\n\nA placement is made by running the line past a contact surface in such a way that friction or geometry of the line position prevents the line from moving. This may be adequate, for example, when going past a boulder which has a notch which holds the line in place.\n\nA tie-off generally involves \"wrapping\" the line round a fixed object once or twice, and may be made more secure by adding a \"lock\", which is made by looping the reel around the incoming line and taking up the slack, before continuing the lay. A lock also puts the incoming and continuing parts of the line in contact, which makes it much easier to follow by feel.\n\nThe security of both placements and tie-offs depends on the detail of the place where they are made, and some may be disrupted by a pull on the line in the wrong direction. This makes the skill of following a line without dislodging it an important safety issue.\n\nPlacements and tie-offs take time to set up, and time to negotiate when following the line by feel, so they should be limited to those which are actually useful. To be useful, a tie-off would limit the distance to the next tie-off to a reasonable distance which could be negotiated with a safety spool in case of a break, or which prevents a line trap.\n\nThe position of the line can make a large difference to the ease with which divers may follow it. The line would ideally allow divers to see of feel it while swimming comfortably without coming into contact with or being obstructed by, the bottom, sides or ceiling. This is not always possible.\n\nThe bottom is often easy to follow by eye and often has suitable tie-off points, but sometimes swimming close to it may cause silting, and it may result in a higher inert gas loading and higher gas consumption than an alternative route.\n\nThe sides have a problem in that they constrain divers to swim on one side of the line only.\n\nThe ceiling may be difficult to tie-off to, and is difficult to follow, as the divers will generally have to look upwards. Following a ceiling guideline by feel can be even more awkward and tiring.\n\nIf the lead diver is the one to lay line on entering the overhead environment, it is possible for other divers in the team to follow the guideline for their safety, and they can check the security of tie-offs and that the line is not moving into traps unnoticed. This order also reduces the risk that a diver will become separated from the team if the line-layer has to stop for any reason.\n\nIf the last diver out is the one to reel in the line, the lead divers can prepare the way by loosening tie-offs just ahead of the reel, and there is less risk of them becoming separated from the group without the reel operator noticing. This can significantly reduce the risk of anyone getting lost. This order is even more safety critical if the exit is in poor visibility. In an emergency, the reel would be left at a tie-off and the divers would exit without recovering the line, as this would save time.\n\nThe primary tie off is made in a place with direct vertical access to the surface, if possible, in a place where it is unlikely to be interfered with by outsiders. This tie-off should be secure.\n\nThe secondary tie-off is made just inside the overhead, where the route to the exit is obvious even if visibility is lost. This is a backup in case the primary tie-off is compromised.\n\nThe temporary entry guide line should be tied off to the permanent line and the reel locked. A recommended method is to make two wraps around the permanent line and then clip the reel back to the line.\n\nThere is more to navigating by guide line than merely following the line.\n\nSurvey of line condition: A permanent guide line may have deteriorated since the latest reliable report on its condition. A complete check of line condition during the penetration will ensure that there are no unpleasant surprises like line breaks or line traps during the exit\n\nDistance from the guideline: Good visibility may be compromised very quickly in some environments. If a diver is more than arm's reach from the line when visibility is lost, it will be necessary to find the line in possibly adverse circumstances. This can be avoided by remaining within reach of the line.\n\nGuide lines are frequently used in areas with heavy silt, and the line may lie on the silt or be close above it If silt is kicked up everyone following will have poor visibility, and the return along the line may be in low or zero visibility, which is at the very least inconvenient. The ability to fin without kicking up the silt relies on good level trim and appropriate finning techniques.\n\nIt can be useful to build up a mental model of the route, even to make notes and sketches indicating major landmarks and changes of direction. This helps to reduce disorientation on return along the line, when the surroundings may look very unfamiliar because they are observed from a different direction. For the same reason, occasional checks in the exit direction will make the route look more familiar on return.\n\nUse of a compass for occasional checks of direction has the advantage of providing a secondary input for sense of direction. This can be of great value when disorientated for any reason.\n\nIt is important for safety to ensure that the gas supply for the return is sufficient for reasonable contingencies. It is more conservative gas management to do any work on the outward leg, and return directly, unless specifically planned otherwise. As the exit is approached, the gas stock and decompression obligations can be re-assessed, and plans adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn 1977, Sheck Exley published \"Basic Cave Diving: A Blueprint for Survival\" which pointed out that the lack of a continuous guideline was one of five contributing factors in cave diving accidents.\n\n"}

A \"canapé\" may also be referred to as finger food, although not all finger foods are \"canapés\". Crackers or small slices of bread or toast or puff pastry, cut into various shapes, serve as the base for savory butters or pastes, often topped with a “canopy” of savory foods as meat, cheese, fish, caviar, \"foie gras\", purées or relish.\n\nTraditionally, \"canapés\" are built on stale bread (although other foods may be used as a base), cut in thin slices and then shaped with a cutter or knife. Shapes might include circles, rings, squares, strips or triangles. These pieces of bread are then prepared by deep frying, sautéing, or toasting. The foods are sometimes highly processed and decoratively applied (e.g., piped) to the base with a pastry bag. Decorative garnishes are then applied. The \"canapés\" are usually served on a \"canapé\" salver and eaten from small \"canapé\" plates. The technical composition of a \"canapé\" consists of a base (e.g., the bread or pancake), a spread, a main item, and a garnish. The spread is traditionally either a compound butter or a flavored cream cheese. Common garnishes can range from finely chopped vegetables, scallions, and herbs to caviar or truffle oil.\n\nA \"vol-au-vent\" (, \"blown by the wind\") is a small, round canapé made of puff pastry.\n\nThe French started offering \"canapés\" to their guests in the 18th century, and the English adopted the practice at the end of the following century. One modern version of the \"canapé\" is the \"amuse-bouche\". \"Amuse-bouche\" literally means “mouth amuser”, but is translated more delicately as “palate pleaser”.\n"}

It may be a long, narrow sandwich, a triangular half-sandwich, or a small biscuit.

The bread crust is cut away cleanly from the sandwich after the sandwich has been prepared but before serving. Modern bread variations might include wheat, pumpernickel, sour dough or rye bread. The bread used for preparing finger sandwiches is sometimes referred to as sandwich bread.\n\nFillings are light, and are \"dainty\" or \"delicate\" in proportion to the amount of bread. Spreads might include butter, cream cheese or mayonnaise mixtures, and the sandwiches often feature fresh vegetables such as radishes, olives, cucumber, asparagus, or watercress.

In Hinduism especially the name \"gopika\" (feminine form of \"gopi\") is used more commonly to refer to the group of cowherding girls famous within Vaishnavism for their unconditional devotion (\"Bhakti\") to Krishna as described in the Bhagavata Purana and other Puranic literature. Of this group, one gopika known as Radha (or Radhika) holds a place of particularly high reverence and importance in a number of religious traditions, especially within Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, there are 108 gopikas of Vrindavan. Although Radha and the other gopis are referred to as \"cowherd girls,\" according to the esoteric theology of Vaishnavism they are the eternal consorts of Krishna, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As such, they are the internal potency, or antaranga shakti, and expansions of the internal potency of the Supreme Godhead.\n\nThe gopis of Vrindavan total 108 in number; \"Krishna charit\" describes the number as 16,000. They are generally divided into three groups: Gopi friends of the same age as Krishna; maidservants; and gopi messengers. The first group are the most exalted (Varistha), Krishna's contemporary gopi friends, the second group are the maidservants and are the next most exalted (Vara), and the gopi messengers come after them. The varistha gopis are more famous than all the others. They are eternally the intimate friends of Radha and Krishna. No one can equal or exceed the love they bear for the divine couple. The primary nine gopis are considered the foremost of Krishna's devotees after Srimati Radharani. Their names are as follows : \n\nAccording to Hindu Vaishnava theology the stories concerning the gopis are said to exemplify \"Suddha-bhakti\" which is described as 'the highest form of unconditional love for God' (Krishna).

Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. They may include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blonde brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized in the U.S. and Canada during the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBrownies are a form of cake, not classified as a cookie or bar. Brownies are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America they are common lunchbox treats, and also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.\n\nOne legend about the creation of brownies is that of Bertha Palmer, a prominent Chicago socialite whose husband owned the Palmer House Hotel. In 1893 Palmer asked a pastry chef for a dessert suitable for ladies attending the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. She requested a cake-like confection smaller than a piece of cake that could be included in boxed lunches. The result was the Palmer House Brownie with walnuts and an apricot glaze. The modern Palmer House Hotel serves a dessert to patrons made from the same recipe. The name was given to the dessert sometime after 1893, but was not used by cook books or journals at the time.\n\nThe first-known printed use of the word \"brownie\" to describe a dessert appeared in the 1896 version of the \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\" by Fannie Farmer, in reference to molasses cakes baked individually in tin molds. The earliest-known published recipes for a modern style chocolate brownie appeared in the \"Home Cookery\" (1904, Laconia, NH), \"Service Club Cook Book\" (1904, Chicago, IL), \"The Boston Globe\" (April 2, 1905 p. 34), and the 1906 edition of Farmer cookbook. These recipes produced a relatively mild and cake-like brownie.\n\nBy 1907 the brownie was well established in a recognizable form, appearing in \"Lowney's Cook Book\" by Maria Willet Howard (published by Walter M. Lowney Company, Boston) as an adaptation of the Boston Cooking School recipe for a \"Bangor Brownie\". It added an extra egg and an additional square of chocolate, creating a richer, fudgier dessert. The name \"Bangor Brownie\" appears to have been derived from the town of Bangor, Maine, which an apocryphal story states was the hometown of a housewife who created the original brownie recipe. Maine food educator and columnist Mildred Brown Schrumpf was the main proponent of the theory that brownies were invented in Bangor. While \"The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink\" (2007) refuted Schrumpf's premise that \"Bangor housewives\" had created the brownie, citing the publication of a brownie recipe in a 1905 Fannie Farmer cookbook, in its second edition, \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America\" (2013) said it had discovered evidence to support Schrumpf's claim, in the form of several 1904 cookbooks that included a recipe for \"Bangor Brownies\".\n\n\n\n"}

Like most such cultural epithets, it can be seen as offensive, but is often seen as amusing by the speaker. The term is contemptuous, essentially describing someone seen to be uncouth and rural.\n\nThe word also shows up as \"cheuchter, chuchter, teuchtar, chookter\" but has no universally accepted orthography. From relative obscurity, it gained currency around 1910. \n\nThere are three main theories on the etymology of the word:\n\nOne folk etymology/urban myth is that during the First World War, many members of the Highland regiments were pipers. A book of sheet music for the pipes is called a \"tutor\", and when pronounced with the pre-aspiration of Gaelic accents when speaking English, this sounds like \"teuchter\".\n\nLike other rural stereotypes, teuchters commonly feature in jokes (Billy Connolly has performed and recorded a sketch where a teuchter visiting the city marvels at a bus as \"a hoose wi wheels\") though such stories often end with the apparently naive teuchter triumphing through hidden wiliness.\n\nThe archetypal cartoon teuchter is the cartoon character Angus Og, created by Ewen Bain.\n\nA teuchter is the hero of Scottish musician Bill Hill's \"The Portree Kid\", which parodies the song \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" as \"The teuchter that cam frae Skye\".\n\n"}
{"id": "498809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498809", "title": "Chimurenga", "text": "Chimurenga\n\nChimurenga is a word in the Shona language, roughly meaning \"revolutionary struggle\". In specific historical terms, it also refers to the Ndebele and Shona insurrections against administration by the British South Africa Company during the late 1890s—the Second Matabele War, or First \"Chimurenga\"—and the war fought between African nationalist guerrillas and the predominantly white Rhodesian government during the 1960s and 1970s—the Rhodesian Bush War, or Second \"Chimurenga\".\n\nThe concept is also occasionally used in reference to the land reform programme undertaken by the Government of Zimbabwe since 2000, which some call a Third \"Chimurenga\". Proponents of land reform regard it as the final phase in what they hold to be the liberation of Zimbabwe through economic and agrarian reforms intended to empower indigenous people. \n\nIn a modern context, the word may denote a struggle for human rights, political dignity and social justice. The expression is also used in context with modern Zimbabwean music, \"Chimurenga\" music.\n\nThe name Chimurenga is coined from the great ancestor of the now Shona, Venda and Kalanga people. The Nambiya people are also a part of this group. Their ancestor was known by the name Murenga Musorowenzou (Head of an Elephant), known by the Venda as \"Thoho yaNdou\" and \"Sholo reZhou\". The later two have named their cities after this man while the Shona honoured him by naming their wars of struggle after him.\n\nThe First \"Chimurenga\" is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First War of Independence. It is also known in the English speaking world as the Second Matabele War. This conflict refers to the 1896–1897 Ndebele-Shona revolt against the British South Africa Company's administration of the territory.\n\nMlimo, the Matabele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and Shona that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. Mlimo's call to battle was well timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid. This left the country's defences in disarray. The Ndebele began their revolt in March 1896.\n\nIn June 1896, Mashayamombe led the uprising of the Zezuru Shona people located to the South West of the capital Salisbury. Mashayamombe worked with the local spiritual leader Kaguvi,and during this period a British farmer Norton and his wife were killed at Porta Farm in Norton.\n\nThe third phase of the First \"Chimurenga\" was joined by the Hwata Dynasty of Mazoe. They succeeded in driving away the British settlers from their lands on 20 June 1896. Three months later,the British South Africa Police (BSAP) regrouped and established control over the Hwata people after their Mambo (King) Hwata surrendered together with his spirit medium, Nehanda Nyakasikana.\nHwata and Nehanda Nyakasikana were sentenced to death and executed.\n\nMlimo was eventually assassinated in his temple in Matobo Hills by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham. Upon learning of the death of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the native's stronghold and persuaded the Impi to lay down their arms. The First \"Chimurenga\" thus ended on October 1897. Matabeleland and Mashonaland were unified under company rule and named Southern Rhodesia.\n\nThe Second \"Chimurenga\", also known as the Rhodesian Bush War or the Zimbabwe Liberation War, refers to the guerrilla war of 1966–1979 which led to the end of white-minority rule in Rhodesia and to the \"de jure\" independence of Zimbabwe. Black nationalist politicians have always regarded Rhodesia as a British colony that paid allegiance to the British crown with British courts having appellate jurisdiction over Rhodesia. Its physical manifestation was, however, as a conflict between the predominantly white minority government, headed by Ian Smith, and the black nationalist movememnts of ZANU (mainly Shona) and ZAPU, respectively led by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.\n\nThis conflict is seen by the majority of black Zimbabweans, the present day Zimbabwean Government and the official Movement for Democratic Change opposition as a war of national liberation from colonialism and racism. At the time of the conflict, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) held this view, as well as the British government, the Organisation for African Unity, the United Nations, the People's Republic of China, the Warsaw Pact, and many members of the Commonwealth of Nations such as Canada, India, Ghana and New Zealand.\n\nAt the time, however, the Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the minority whites) on behalf of the whole country, including the blacks against another, externally financed party, made up of what it saw as black radicals and communists, in defence of the country and of claimed Western ideals. While the nationalists claimed to represent the majority black Shona and Ndebele population, the Rhodesian administration saw the traditional chiefs as the legitimate voice of the Shona and Ndebele peoples and the nationalists as dangerous usurpers.\n\n\"Chimurenga\" also refers to a style of music first branded by Thomas Mapfumo, who mixed indigenous African rhythmic patterns and instruments such as Mbira (thumb piano), drums, gourd rattles with Western styles (electric guitar) in songs that achieved wide popularity among the protest movement against white minority rule. Today the term \"Chimurenga\" music refers to popular Shona music from Zimbabwe.\n"}

Many people in Hong Kong, as well as professional chefs, also bake modern variants.\n\nThe orthodox version is from the Guangdong-Hong Kong region, where the filling consists of candied wintermelon. The candied wintermelon mash is then combined with white sesame seeds and glutinous rice flour. Coconut in the form of mash or desiccated shreds and almond paste as well as vanilla is also sometimes added. The authentic flavour and flaky texture of the pastry is produced by the usage of pork lard shortening then by glazing with egg wash. Due to its rising popularity in Western countries brought about by immigration, butter is sometimes substituted in place of lard, however the taste is altered. The level of sweetness is mild, compared to Western sweet pastries.\n\nSouth-east Asian variations can include spices such as Chinese five spice (五香粉). However, although this spice is of Chinese origin, it is never used in authentic Sweetheart cake. This may be confused with the Husband cake, which uses star anise in its filling.\n\nThere are many legends that attempt to explain the origins of the Sweetheart cake. One tells the tale of a couple that lived a very poor life, in imperial China. They loved each other and lived in a small village. Suddenly, a mysterious disease spread. The husband's father became very sick. The couple spent all of their money in order to treat the man's father, but he was still sick. The wife sold herself as a slave in exchange for money to buy medicine for her father-in-law. Once the husband learned about what his wife did, he made a cake filled with sweetened wintermelon and almond. He dedicated this pastry to his wife, whom he could never forget, and sold it in the street. His cake became so popular that he was able to earn enough money to buy his wife back.\n\nThere is another version where the man went searching for his wife after he earned enough money to buy her back. In his search, he had a cup of tea at a local teahouse, when he suddenly recognised the pastry they were serving with the tea. They were reunited at the teahouse.\n\nAnother story tells of a dimsum chef's wife creating a pastry with wintermelon paste influenced by a recipe from her mother's family. The new pastry was found to taste better than the dimsums that were being sold in teahouses and the chef proudly told everyone it was made by his wife, hence it was named \"Wife Cake\".\n\n"}

Chinese noodles vary widely according to the region of production, ingredients, shape or width, and manner of preparation. They are an important part of most regional cuisines within China, as well as in Singapore, and other Southeast Asian nations with sizable overseas Chinese populations.\n\nChinese-style noodles have also entered the cuisines of neighboring East Asian countries such as Korea (\"jajangmyeon\") and Japan (\"ramen\"), as well as Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam (\"hủ tiếu\" and \"mì xào\" are both examples of Vietnamese dishes that are of Chinese origin), the Philippines, Thailand, and Cambodia.\n\nNomenclature of Chinese noodles can be difficult due to the vast spectrum available in China and the many dialects of Chinese used to name them. In Mandarin, miàn (; often transliterated as \"mien\" or \"mein\" ) refers to noodles made from wheat, while fěn () or \"fun\" refers to noodles made from rice flour, mung bean starch, or indeed any kind of non-wheat starch. Each noodle type can be rendered in pinyin for Mandarin, but in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong it will be known by its Cantonese pronunciation (\"main\"). Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other Overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia may use Hokkien (Min Nan) instead (\"mee\").\n\nThe earliest written record of noodles is from a book dated to the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). Noodles, often made from wheat dough, became a prominent staple of food during the Han dynasty. In the Western Han Dynasty, due to the demand for military, it was necessary for the Government to implement food processing technologies that would make the food storage easier and more affordable. During this time, “Laomian” was emerged, it was made with starch rich buckwheat, millet and pea, flours. It consists lower water content making it easier to store and transport around.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty (960–1279) noodle shops were very popular in the cities, and remained open all night. During the earlier dynastic periods Chinese wheat noodles were known as \"soup cake\" (湯餅), as explained by the Song dynasty scholar Huang Chaoying (黃朝英) mentions in his work \"\"A delightful mixed discussion on various scholarly topics\"\" (, Scroll 2) that in ancient times bready foods like pasta are referred collectively as \"bing\" and differentiated through their cooking methods.\n\nChinese noodles are generally made from either wheat flour, rice flour, or mung bean starch, with wheat noodles being more commonly produced and consumed in northern China and rice noodles being more typical of southern China. Egg, lye, and cereal may also be added to noodles made from wheat flour in order to give the noodles a different color or flavor. Egg whites, arrowroot or tapioca starch are sometimes added to the flour mixture in low quantities to change the texture and tenderness of the noodles' strands. Although illegal, the practice of adding the chemical cross-linker borax to whiten noodles and improve their texture is also quite common in East Asia. In general, the chinese noodles cooking method involves making a dough with flour, salt, and water; mixing the dough by hand to form bar shapes; bending the bars for proofing; pulling the bars into strips; dropping the strips into a pot with boiling water; and removing the noodles when finished cooking. Chinese type noodles are generally made from hard wheat flours, characterized by bright creamy white or bright yellow color and firm texture. \n\nBefore the automatic noodle machine was invented in 1950s, the processing of Chinese noodles were made with four steps, including Fresh - The noodles are often consumed within 24 hours of manufacture due to quick discoloration. Their shelf life can be extended to 3-5 days if stored under refrigeration; Dried - Fresh noodle stands are dried by sunlight or in a controlled chamber. Chinese noodles, can be in dried form; Boiled - Fresh noodle strands are either parboiled or fully cooked. After parboiling, Chinese noodles are rinsed in cold water, drained and covered with 1-2% vegetable oil to prevent sticking; Steamed - Fresh alkaline noodle strands are steamed in a steamer and softened with water through rinsing.\n\nThe dough for noodles made from wheat flour is typically made from wheat flour, salt, and water, with the addition of eggs or lye depending on the desired texture and taste of the noodles. Rice- or other starch-based noodles are typically made with only the starch or rice flour and water. After the formation of a pliable dough mass, one of five types of mechanical processing may be applied to produce the noodles:\n\nWhile cut and extruded noodles can be dried to create a shelf-stable product to be eaten months after production, most peeled, pulled and kneaded noodles are consumed shortly after they are produced.\n\nNoodles may be cooked from either their fresh (moist) or dry forms. They are generally boiled, although they may also be deep-fried in oil until crispy. Boiled noodles may then be stir fried, served with sauce or other accompaniments, or served in soup, often with meat and other ingredients. Certain rice-noodles are made directly from steaming the raw rice slurry and are only consumed fresh.\n\nUnlike many Western noodles and pastas, Chinese noodles made from wheat flour are usually made from salted dough, and therefore do not require the addition of salt to the liquid in which they are boiled. Chinese noodles also cook very quickly, generally requiring less than 5 minutes to become \"al dente\" and some taking less than a minute to finish cooking, with thinner noodles requiring less time to cook. Chinese noodles made from rice or mung bean starch do not generally contain salt.\n\nThese noodles are made only with wheat flour and water. If the intended product is dried noodles, salt is almost always added to the recipe.\nThese wheat flour noodles are more chewy in texture and yellow in colour either due to the addition of lye (sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide) and/or egg. This class of lye water noodles () has a subtle but distinctive smell and taste, described by some as being \"eggy\".\n\nRice-based noodles can be: \nThese noodles are typically made only with rice and water without the addition of salt. Although unorthodox, some producers may choose to add other plant starches to modify the texture of the noodles.\n\nThese noodles are made using various plant starches. Mung bean starch noodles will often be cut with tapioca starch to make them more chewy and reduce production costs.\n\nIn China, particularly in western Inner Mongolia and Shanxi province, oat (\"Avena nuda\") flour is called \"youmian\" (莜面), and is processed into noodles or thin-walled rolls, which are consumed as staple food. The process of making oat noodles is special. The oat dough is twisted on marble plate which can ensure the dough will not stick on it, into strips and thin-rolls. It can be boiled and also steamed with different sauces to eat.\n\nThe following are a small portion of Chinese dishes that incorporate noodles:\n\n\n"}

Unlike other plant-based packaging, the bottles are compatible with standard recycling plants and represent up to a 25% reduction in carbon emissions when compared to standard water bottles, though this still represents 2000 times the energy usage of tap water.\n\nDasani was launched in all provinces of Canada except Quebec in 2000, a year after launching in the United States. The brand was made available in Quebec shortly afterwards, in April 2001.\n\nThere are six common Dasani bottle sizes sold in Canada: 355 mL (12 fl oz), 500mL, 591 mL (20 fl oz), 710 mL (24 fl oz), 1 L, and 1.5 L. Bottles are sold individually and in packs of 6, 12, and 24.\n\nThe first source of Dasani water in Canada was Calgary, Alberta. A second bottling plant was later opened in Brampton, Ontario. The Calgary and Brampton plants produce Coca-Cola's plain-water (Dasani) and sugar-water (soft drinks) products. The company's administrative and marketing activities continue to be based in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nDasani has <35 ppm of total dissolved mineral salts .\n\nIn early 2005, two flavored versions of Dasani were introduced: Dasani With Lemon and Dasani With Raspberry. Dasani with Strawberry has since been introduced. The flavored beverages are sweetened with sucralose.\n\nDasani was introduced to the Brazilian market in mid-2003, renamed as \"Aquarius\". It was introduced to the Chilean market in 2005, including releases in regular, lemon and tangerine flavors. It was released in Colombia in late 2005 with their three regular flavors. In 2005, Dasani was introduced in the Argentinian market with the flavours peach, lemon, citrus and regular. It was also released under the name \"Ciel Dasani\" in Mexico in four flavours: lemon-cucumber, papaya-carrot, grapefruit and mandarin-green tea, but it was discontinued in 2006. It was also released in Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Honduras.\n\nDasani was launched in the UK on 10 February 2004. The product launch was labelled \"a disaster\", a \"fiasco\", and a \"PR catastrophe\". \n\nPrior to the launch, an article in \"The Grocer\" trade magazine had mentioned that the source of the Dasani brand water was treated tap water from Sidcup, a suburban area on the outskirts of London. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up the story and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water, after being processed by reverse osmosis, had been remineralized, bottled and sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK. Although Coca-Cola never implied that the water was being sourced from a spring or other natural sources, they marketed it as being especially \"pure\". This led the Food Standards Agency to request Hillingdon trading standards officers to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.\n\nRichard May, Chief Publicity Officer of Dasani, was said to be disappointed that the water had not been more successful.\n\nOn 18 March 2004, UK authorities found a concentration of bromate, a suspected human carcinogen, in the product that could be considered harmful if consumed in large quantities. Coca-Cola immediately recalled half a million bottles and withdrew the \"Dasani\" brand from the UK market. Shortly after, plans to introduce the brand to Continental Europe were announced to have been cancelled as well. Bromate was not present in the water before Coca-Cola's treatment process. During that process, the bromate was produced from the water’s bromide by exposure to ozone.\n\nCoca-Cola intended to launch Dasani in France and Germany, although this never went ahead after bad publicity in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn line with the 2012 Summer Olympics and being the official drink sponsor, Coca-Cola decided not to reintroduce the Dasani brand to the UK market, and purchased the Morpeth, Northumberland-based Abbey Well bottler in 2008, branded under the Schweppes brand name (which Coca-Cola holds the UK rights to) to provide a locally sourced water brand for the event. To meet Olympic branding regulations, Abbey Well water was labeled as \"Still Water\" for on-camera appearances during the Games.\n\nIn Ireland, it is marketed as Deep River Rock.\n\n"}
{"id": "502116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=502116", "title": "Lifting bag", "text": "Lifting bag\n\nA lifting bag is an item of diving equipment consisting of a robust and air-tight bag with straps, which is used to lift heavy objects underwater by means of the bag's buoyancy. The heavy object can either be moved horizontally underwater by the diver or sent unaccompanied to the surface.\n\nLift bag appropriate capacity should match the task at hand. If the lift bag is grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available lifting bags may incorporate dump valves to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, but this is a hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single bag is insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.\n\nThere are also lifting bags used on land as short lift jacks for lifting cars or heavy loads or lifting bags which are used in machines as a type of pneumatic actuator which provides load over a large area. These lifting bags of the AS/CR type are for example used in the brake mechanism of rollercoasters.\n\nThe volume of the bag determines its lifting capacity: each litre of air inside the bag will lift a weight of 1 kilogram, or each cubic foot will lift about 62 pounds. For example, a bag can lift a underwater object.\n\nA partially filled bag will accelerate as it ascends because the air in the bag expands as the pressure reduces on the ascent, following Boyles law, increasing the bag's buoyancy, whereas a full bag will overflow or blow off excess volume and maintain the same volume and buoyancy providing is does not descend. A bag which leaks sufficiently to start sinking will lose volume to compression and become less buoyant in a positive feedback loop until stopped by the bottom.\n\nThe force required to lift a submerged object from the bottom can be split into two main components:\nOnce the object has broken free of the bottom, only the apparent weight remains, and a controlled lift requires a way of managing the sudden decrease of resistance to the lifting force. There are three basic ways this can be done:\n\nOnce a load is lifted off the substrate, it will rotate until the centre of gravity is in the position of lowest potential energy. If it is suspended from a single point, the apparent centre of gravity (corrected for inherent buoyancy) will be directly below the lift point. If it is undesirable for the load to rotate by a large angle as it leaves the bottom, the lifting point must be chosen to allow for this effect, and a multi-part sling or spreader bar may be needed, and it may be necessary to secure slings so they do not slip.\n\nUnderwater lifting bags are lifting equipment and as such may be required to comply with safety standards.\n\nParachute lift bags are open at the bottom. When full any extra or expanding air will spill out. The shape of an open lifting bag should distribute the volume in a vertical rather than a horizontal direction so that the open end of the bag always remains underwater. If the open end reaches the surface, air will escape from the bag and it may sink.\n\nThe simplest version are two-sided bags, either joined round the edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to doubler patches which are then glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over the fabric of the bag.\n\nParachute lift bags cannot be overfilled and are suitable for lifts where there is a large pressure change, and where it may be necessary to capsize (invert) the bag to stop a runaway lift.\n\nSome lift bags can be converted from open to closed by screwing a cover onto the bottom opening.\n\nClosed lift bags have an overpressure valve to prevent internal pressure from exceeding ambient pressure by more than a set amount (around 10kPa, or 1msw) Closed lift bags are intended for use at or near the surface, as they retain the air even in rough seas. They are available in several configurations, including horizontal cylinder, vertical cylinder, teardrop and pillow.\n\nRapid deployment lift bags have a scuba cylinder mounted on the outside which contains sufficient air to inflate the bag at a specified depth. The bag can be attached to the load and when ready, the valve is opened and the diver swims clear. If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the over-pressure relief valve, a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the relief valve opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between the top and bottom of the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.\n\nDump valves are used to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be operated manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.\n\nWhen the empty lift bag is attached to the load and the lift is made by controlling the volume of inflation air it is referred to as a dynamic lift.\n\nThe bag or set of bags is used to lift the load directly to the surface. This is simple, but there is a risk if the lift bag is too large and cannot be vented fast enough the lift may get out of control and ascend so fast that the bag breaks the surface, capsizes and collapses, losing so much air that it then cannot support the weight of the load, and will then sink back to the bottom. If there is a marker buoy attached it will at least not be lost. A lift bag which is only slightly larger than needed to support the load will ascend more slowly, and is less likely to capsize at the surface, as excess air will be spilled continuously during the ascent.\n\nLift bags are used to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This procedure continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work on or near the lifting gear when under load.\n\nThe lift is controlled by a line from the surface vessel, and the load is reduced by a lift bag with a volume too small to support the weight of the load when full. This allows a faster lift by the winch. The lifting gear must be capable of supporting the load if the bag fails, or must be arranged to fail safely.\n\nA buoyancy assisted lift is a common procedure for recreational divers to assist the recovery of the shotline or anchor, which would otherwise be pulled up manually. A small lift bag attached to the shot is partially filled by the last diver to leave the bottom, and after surfacing the crew pull up the line and the air in the bag expands as it ascends, providing more assistance to the crew. In this application a runaway lift is not usually a problem, and the bag size is not critical.\n\nLift bags also can be used for static lifts, where the bag is anchored in place by rigging, and used as a lifting point with very high buoyancy compared to the load, which is then lifted in a controlled manner using a purchase or chain block or other suitable lifting device.\n\nLift bags can not be over inflated, and can not normally exert a static buoyant force greater than their safe working load, however the rigging can be subjected to snatch loads, which can be caused by a variety of factors.\n\nWhen lifting with more than one bag, allowance should be made for reduced filling capacity if bags are attached in such a way that they press against each other.\n\nIncorrect rigging can cause load concentration on attachment points which may exceed the SWL\n\nA inverter or capsizing line can be attached to the top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.\n\nA holdback line is used to prevent the lift bag and load from floating away when used for short distance lifts at the bottom. The holdback is attached to the lifting ring of the bag, or to the load, and should be attached by a strong cable to an anchor point it cannot lift. The SWL of the holdback should be at least equal to the lifting capacity of the bag. A holdback and inverter are often used together.\n\nA spreader bar may be used to distribute the lifting load more evenly between bags or along the load.\n\nWhen filling bags, if each bag is completely filled before starting to fill the next bag, it is less likely that a runaway will be initiated, as only one of the bags can increase lift as it ascends. This will be the last bag, and the divers will be monitoring it most carefully while they are filling it, so will be more likely to react in time to regain control of the lift.\n\nA weighted dump line will automatically start open the valve to start dumping excess air if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This will stop the lift from ascending any further if the dump valve releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the valve spring and the size of the valve opening.\n\nThe amount of air required for a lift bag depends on the apparent weight of the load and the depth of the bag. Approximately 1 m of air at ambient pressure is required per tonne of lift. Free air volume follows Boyle's law, and is proportional to absolute ambient pressure in bar or ata.\n\n\"For example: A 5 tonne lift with the bags to be filled at 20m, requires 5m of air at 3 bar, which is 15m at surface pressure.\"\n\nFilling air is usually supplied from the surface from a low pressure compressor, but for small lifts the diver may carry a cylinder of air for the purpose. It is considered bad practice in some jurisdictions to fill a lift bag from the diver's breathing gas cylinder, particularly if the diver has decompression obligations or only one cylinder as the risk of using up too much air and leaving the diver without sufficient air for a safe ascent is considered unacceceptable.\n\nBags can be inflated from a safer distance by use of an air-lance (a rigid pipe which can be inserted into the opening of the bag).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "502136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=502136", "title": "Color term", "text": "Color term\n\nA color term (or color name) is a word or phrase that refers to a specific color. The color term may refer to human perception of that color (which is affected by visual context) which is usually defined according to the Munsell color system, or to an underlying physical property (such as a specific wavelength of visible light). There are also numerical systems of color specification, referred to as color spaces.\n\nAn important distinction must be established between color and shape, these two attributes usually are used in conjunction with one another when describing in language. For example, being labeled as alternative parts of speech terms color term and shape term.\n\nPsychological conditions for recognition of colors exist, such as those who cannot discern colors in general (Aphantasia) or those who see colors as sound (Synesthesia)\n\nMonolexemic color words are composed of individual lexemes, or root words, such as \"red\", \"brown\", or \"olive\". Compound color words make use of adjectives (e.g. \"light brown\", \"sea green\") or compounded basic color words (e.g. \"yellow-green\").\n\nThere are many different dimensions by which color varies. For example, hue (shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), saturation (\"deep\" vs. \"pale\"), and brightness or intensity make up the HSI color space. The adjective \"fluorescent\" in English refers to moderately high brightness with strong color saturation. Pastel refers to colors with high brightness and low saturation.\n\nSome phenomena are due to related optical effects, but may or may not be described separately from the color name. These include gloss (high-gloss shades are sometimes described as \"metallic\"; this is also a distinguishing feature of gold and silver), iridescence or goniochromism (angle-dependent color), dichroism (two-color surfaces), and opacity (solid vs. translucent).\n\nDifferent cultures have different terms for colors, and may also assign some color terms to slightly different parts of the human color space: for instance, the Chinese character 青 (pronounced in Mandarin and in Japanese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of \"青\". In more contemporary terms, they are 藍 (, in Mandarin) and 綠 (, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, (, derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb \"to be in leaf, to flourish\" in reference to trees) and (, which is derived from the English word \"green\"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, , because green is considered a shade of ; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green \"shiso\" (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word .\n\nSimilarly, languages are selective when deciding which hues are split into different colors on the basis of how light or dark they are. English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness: such as red and pink or orange and brown. To English speakers, these pairs of colors, which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green, are conceived of as belonging to different categories. A Russian will make the same red / pink and orange / brown distinctions, but will also make a further distinction between and , which English speakers would simply call dark and light blue. To Russian speakers, and are as separate as red and pink, or orange and brown.\n\nSeveral researchers have studied the Ova-Himba perception of colors. The Ova-Himba use four color names: \"zuzu\" stands for dark shades of blue, red, green, and purple; \"vapa\" is white and some shades of yellow; \"buru\" is some shades of green and blue; and \"dambu\" is some other shades of green, red, and brown. It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the Ova-Himba to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category, compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories.\n\nHungarian and Turkish have multiple words for \"red\": and (Hungarian; is a darker red), and , , and (Turkish); kırmızı now includes all reds but originally referred to crimson, to which it is cognate, while kızıl mainly refers to scarlet and other orange-tinted or brownish reds. Two words for \"red\" are also found in Irish and Scottish Gaelic ( for light, bright red and or respectively for dark, brownish red). Turkish also has two words for \"white\" ( and ) and \"black\" ( and ). Ak and beyaz have the same meaning, while kara is a broader term than siyah and also includes dark browns; which word is used also depends on the kind of object being described. Similarly, Irish uses two words for green: denotes the green color of plants, while describes artificial greens of dyes, paints etc. This distinction is made even if two shades are identical.\n\nIn the Komi language, green is considered a shade of yellow (, ), called (: \"grass yellow\".\n\nIn the Pirahã language, there may be no color words.\n\nHowever, in the classic study of Brent Berlin and Paul Kay (1969), \"\" , the researchers argued that these differences can be organized into a coherent hierarchy, and that there are a limited number of universal basic colour terms which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. Berlin and Kay based their analysis on a comparison of colour words in 20 languages from around the world. To be considered a basic colour term, the words had to be\n\nTheir model is presented below:<br>\nformula_1 < formula_2 < formula_3 < formula_4 < formula_5 < formula_6\n\nBerlin and Kay's study further identified a culture state of color term recognition into stages (I-VII). Stage I only covers two terms white and black; these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms. For example, the Jale highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black. This is because at this stage I, white and black, are associated with which objects closer associates to the degree of brightness from which it has.\n\nWith stage II the recognition of another term red is developed. Objects are less consternated to their degree of brightness for classification and instead in this stage we see each term cover a larger scope of colors. Specifically blue and other darker shades described as black, yellow/orange colors lumped together with red, and the colors similar to white as white.\n\nAt stage III the identification of another term is acquired. The newly acquired term differs but usually with either green (III a) or yellow (III b). At this stage, there are more cultures who recognize yellow rather than green first. Currently, there are two languages which identify green first, the Ibiobio Nigerian language and the Philippine language of Mindoro, Hanunoo.\n\nAt stage IV regardless of which term was acquired by a culture the term not defined is now acquired at this stage bringing the total terms to five.\n\nIn short, their analysis showed that in a culture with only two terms, they would roughly correlate with \"dark\" (covering black, dark colors, and cold colors such as blue) and \"bright\" (covering white, light colors, and warm colors such as red). All languages with three colors terms would add red to this distinction. Thus, the three most basic colors are black, white, and red. Additional color terms are added in a fixed order as a language evolves: first one of green or yellow; then the other of green or yellow; then blue. All languages distinguishing six colors contain terms for black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.\n\nAs languages develop, they next adopt a term for brown; then terms for orange, pink, purple or gray, in any order. Finally, a basic light/dark relativistic term appears: such as \"light\" blue / \"dark\" blue (in comparison to blue sky / blue ocean), or \"pale\" red / \"deep\" red.\n\nThe proposed evolutionary trajectories as of 1999 are as follows. 80% of sampled languages lie along the central path.\n\nToday every natural language that has words for colors is considered to have from two to twelve basic color terms. All other colors are considered by most speakers of that language to be variants of these basic color terms. English contains eleven basic color terms: \"black\", \"white\", \"red\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\", \"brown\", \"orange\", \"pink\", \"purple\", and \"grey\". Italian, Russian and Hebrew have twelve, distinguishing blue and azure. That doesn't mean English speakers cannot describe the difference of the two colors, of course; however, in English, \"azure\" is not a basic color term because one can say \"bright sky blue\" instead, while \"pink\" is basic because speakers do not say \"light red\".\n\nColor words in a language can also be divided into abstract color words and descriptive color words, though the distinction is blurry in many cases. Abstract color words are words that only refer to a color. In English white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, and gray are abstract color words. These words also happen to be 'basic color terms' in English as described above, but colors like maroon and magenta are also abstract though they may not be considered 'basic color terms', either because they are considered by native speakers to be too rare, too specific, or subordinate hues of more basic colors (red in the case of maroon, or purple/pink in the case of magenta).\n\nDescriptive color words are words that are secondarily used to describe a color but primarily used to refer to an object or phenomenon. \"Salmon\", \"rose\", \"saffron\", and \"lilac\" are descriptive color words in English because their use as color words is derived in reference to natural colors of salmon flesh, rose flowers, infusions of saffron pistils, and lilac blossoms respectively. Often a descriptive color word will be used to specify a particular hue of basic color term (salmon and rose [descriptive] are both hues of pink).\n\nColors in some languages may be denoted by descriptive color words even though other languages may use an abstract color word for the same color; for example in Japanese pink is (, lit. \"peach-color\") and gray is either or (, , lit. \"ash-color\" for light grays and \"mouse-color\" for dark grays respectively); nevertheless, as languages change they may adopt or invent new abstract color terms, as Japanese has adopted () for pink and () for gray from English. \"Vaaleanpunainen\", the Finnish word for \"pink\" is a clear agglutination of the language's words for \"white\" (\"valkoinen\") and \"red\" (\"punainen\").\n\nThe status of some color words as abstract or descriptive is debatable. The color \"pink\" was originally a descriptive color word derived from the name of a flower called a \"pink\" (see dianthus); however, because the word \"pink\" (flower) has become very rare whereas \"pink\" (color) has become very common, many native speakers of English use \"pink\" as an abstract color word alone and furthermore consider it to be one of the basic color terms of English. The name \"purple\" is another example of this shift, as it was originally a word that referred to a dye (see Tyrian purple).\n\nThe word \"orange\" is difficult to categorize as abstract or descriptive because both its uses, as a color word and as a word for an object, are very common and it is difficult to distinguish which of the two is primary. As a basic color term it became established in the early to mid 20th century; before that time artist's palettes called it \"yellow-red\". In English, the use of the word \"orange\" for a fruit predates its use as a color term. The word comes from French , which derives via Sanskrit from a Dravidian language such as Tamil or Tulu. The derived form \"orangish\" as a color is attested from the late 19th century by reference to the fruit. Nevertheless, \"orange\" (color) is usually given equal status to red, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, gray, white and black (all abstract colors) in membership among the basic color terms of English. Based solely on current usage of the word, it would be impossible to distinguish whether the fruit is called an orange because of its color, or the color is so called after the fruit. (This problem is also illustrated by \"violet\" and \"indigo\".)\n\nIn Italian there is an adjective \"arancione\" different of and derived from the fruit name \"arancio\". In Portuguese, it is usual to distinguish the fruit \"laranja\" from the color name \"cor-de-laranja\", which means 'color-of-orange'. The same goes for \"Rosa\" ('rose') and \"cor-de-rosa\" ('color-of-rose'); and \"Violeta\" ('violet') and \"cor-de-violeta\" ('color-of-violet').\n\nResearch on color terms is often conducted without reference to common uses of the term or its significance within the context of its original language. In John A. Lucy's article \"The linguistics of \"color\"\" he identifies two key categories. One of these is \"characteristic referential range\", or the use of a color term to identify or differentiate a referent over a wide context.\n\nResearch across different languages and how they define a color term becomes increasingly difficult as differentiating and relying on traditional methods rather than cultural and intuition become problematic.\n\nSome examples of color naming systems are CNS and ISCC–NBS lexicon of color terms. The disadvantage of these systems, however, is that they only specify specific color samples, so while it is possible to, by interpolating, convert any color to or from one of these systems, a lookup table is required. In other words, no simple invertible equation can convert between CIE XYZ and one of these systems.\n\nPhilatelists traditionally use names to identify postage stamp colors. While the names are largely standardized within each country, there is no broader agreement, and so for instance the US-published Scott catalog will use different names than the British Stanley Gibbons catalogue.\n\nOn modern computer systems a standard set of basic color terms is now used across the web color names (SVG 1.0/CSS3), HTML color names, X11 color names and the .NET Framework color names, with only a few minor differences.\n\nThe Crayola company is famous for its many crayon colors, often creatively named.\n\nHeraldry has standardized names for \"tinctures\", subdivided into \"colors\", \"metals\", and \"furs\".\n\nEven the base word of a color has strong metaphorical resonances. For example, a linguistic study of Berlin and Kay study showed that the color red was almost always named at stage II due to the crucial importance of blood.\n\nModifiers expand and nuance the connotations of a color, as best seen in fashion and paint terminology, which seeks to imbue colors with emotional associations. Thus the same \"poppy yellow\" paint can become the hot-blooded \"amber rage\", the peaceful \"late afternoon sunshine\", or the wealth-evoking \"sierra gold\". The divisions of General Motors often give different names to the same colors featured on different car models. The attachment of an emotional context to a color may make it easier for a customer to decide among choices.\n\nNames given to the most vivid colors often include the word \"neon\", alluding to the bright glow of neon lighting. Dyes and inks producing these colors are often fluorescent, producing a luminous glow when viewed under a black light, and such pigments appear significantly brighter in mid-day overcast conditions due to a greater proportion of ultraviolet light.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "502185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=502185", "title": "Broth", "text": "Broth\n\nBroth is a savory liquid made of water in which bones, meat, fish, or vegetables have been simmered. It can be eaten alone, but it is most commonly used to prepare other dishes, such as soups, gravies, and sauces.\n\nCommercially prepared liquid broths are available, typically for \"chicken broth\", \"beef broth\", \"fish broth\", and \"vegetable broth\". In North America, dehydrated meat stock in the form of tablets is called a bouillon cube. Industrially produced bouillon cubes were commercialized under the brand name Maggi in 1908, and by Oxo in 1910. Using commercially prepared broths saves home and professional cooks time in the kitchen.\n\nBy 2013, broth labeled as \"bone broth\" became popularized as a health food trend or fad in certain parts of the United States.\n\nMany cooks and food writers use the terms \"broth\" and \"stock\" interchangeably. In 1974, James Beard wrote emphatically that stock, broth, and bouillon \"are all the same thing\".\n\nWhile many draw a distinction between stock and broth, the details of the distinction often differ. One possibility is that stocks are made primarily from animal bones, as opposed to meat, and therefore contain more gelatin, giving them a thicker texture. Another distinction that is sometimes made is that stock is cooked longer than broth and therefore has a more intense flavor. A third possible distinction is that stock is left unseasoned for use in other recipes, while broth is salted and otherwise seasoned and can be eaten alone.\n\nIn Britain, \"broth\" can refer to a soup which includes solid pieces of meat, fish, or vegetables, whereas \"stock\" would refer to the purely liquid base. Traditionally, according to this definition, broth contained some form of meat or fish; however, nowadays it is acceptable to refer to a strictly vegetable soup as a broth.\n\n\"Bouillon\" (, ; ) is the French word for \"broth\", and is usually used as a synonym for it.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Benjamin Thompson, (1753–1814) an American-born physicist in service to the Elector of Bavaria, invented and mass-produced a fully nutritious, solidified stock of bones, inexpensive meat by-products and other ingredients, using it to feed the Elector's army. His invention was the precursor of the bouillon cube.\nBroth has been made for many years using the animal bones which, traditionally, are boiled in a cooking pot for long periods to extract the flavor and nutrients. The bones may or may not have meat still on them.\n\nEgg whites may be added during simmering when it is necessary to clarify (i.e., purify, or refine a broth for a cleaner presentation). The egg whites will coagulate, trapping sediment and turbidity into an easily strained mass. Not allowing the original preparation to boil will increase the clarity.\n\nRoasted bones will add a rich flavor to the broth but also a dark color.\n\nA clarified broth eaten as a soup is often called a consommé.\n\nIn East Asia (particularly Japan), a form of kelp called kombu is often used as the basis for broths (called \"dashi\" in Japanese).\n\nIn the Maldives the tuna broth known as \"garudiya\" is a basic food item, but it is not eaten as a soup in the general sense of the term.\n\nBy 2013, \"bone broth\" had become a popular health food trend, due to the resurgence in popularity of dietary fat over sugar, and interest in \"functional foods\" to which \"culinary medicinals\" such as turmeric and ginger could be added. Bone broth \"bars\", bone broth home \"delivery services\", and bone broth \"carts\" and \"freezer packs\" grew in popularity in the United States. The fad was heightened by the 2014 book \"Nourishing Broth\", in which authors Sally Fallon Morell and Kaayla T. Daniel state that the broth's nutrient density has a variety of health effects: boosting the immune system; improving joints, skin and hair due to collagen content; and promoting healthy teeth and bones due to calcium, magnesium and phosphorus levels.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence to support many of the claims made for bone broth. For example, while bone broths do contain collagen, there is no evidence that consuming bone broths improves joint pain or improve skin, because dietary collagen is broken down into amino acids, which become building blocks for body tissues, and is not transported directly to joints or skin in the form in which it is ingested. In addition, the fact that the broth is derived from bone does not mean that therefore it will build bone or prevent osteoporosis, as the bones release very little calcium into the broth when prepared. There is little evidence that the gelatin that they contain functions as a digestive aid. A few small studies have found some possible benefit for chicken broth, such as the clearing of nasal passages. Chicken soup may also reduce inflammation; however, this effect has not been confirmed in controlled studies of adults.\n\n"}
{"id": "504072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504072", "title": "Tabular Islamic calendar", "text": "Tabular Islamic calendar\n\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar (an example is the Fatimid or Misri calendar) is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar. It has the same numbering of years and months, but the months are determined by arithmetical rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculations. It was developed by early Muslim astronomers of the second hijra century (the 8th century of the Common Era) to provide a predictable time base for calculating the positions of the moon, sun, and planets. It is now used by historians to convert an Islamic date into a Western calendar when no other information (like the day of the week) is available. Its calendar era is the Hijri year.\n\nIt is used by some Muslims in everyday life, particularly in Ismaili communities, believing that this calendar was developed by Ali. It is believed that when Ali drew up this calendar, the previous events of the earlier prophets also fell into line with this calendar. It is their belief that all Fatimid Imams and their Da'is have followed this tradition.\n\nEach year has 12 months. The odd numbered months have 30 days and the even numbered months have 29 days, except in a leap year when the 12th and final month Dhul-Hijjah has 30 days.\n\nIn its most common form there are 11 leap years in a 30-year cycle. Noting that the average year has 354 11/30 days and a common year has 354 days, at the end of the first year of the 30-year cycle the remainder is 11/30 day. Whenever the remainder exceeds a half day (15/30 day), then a leap day is added to that year, reducing the remainder by one day. Thus at the end of the second year the remainder would be 22/30 day which is reduced to −8/30 day by a leap day. Using this rule the leap years are\nof the 30-year cycle. If leap days are added whenever the remainder \"equals\" or exceeds a half day, then all leap years are the same except 15 replaces 16.\n\nThe Ismaili Tayyebi community uses the following order of leap years in their 30-year cycle.\n\nApart from these, there is another version which orders the leap years as follows\n\nThe mean month is 29 191/360 days = 29.5305555... days, or 29d 12h 44m. This is slightly too short and so will be a day out in about 2,500 solar years or 2,570 lunar years. The Tabular Islamic calendar also deviates from the observation based calendar in the short term for various reasons.\n\nThe \"Kuwaiti algorithm\" is used by Microsoft to convert between Gregorian calendar dates and Islamic calendar dates. There is no fixed correspondence defined in advance between the Gregorian solar calendar and the Islamic lunar calendar, since the latter is defined by the visibility of the new moon by religious authorities and can therefore vary by a day or two, depending on the particular Islamic authority, weather conditions, and other variables. As an attempt to make conversions between the calendars somewhat predictable, Microsoft claims to have created this algorithm based on statistical analysis of historical data from Kuwait.\n\nAccording to Robert Harry van Gent at Utrecht University, the so-called \"Kuwaiti algorithm\" is simply an implementation of a standard Tabular Islamic calendar algorithm used in Islamic astronomical tables since the 11th century.\n\nTabular Islamic calendars based on an eight – year cycle (with 2, 5 and 8 as leap years) were also used in the Ottoman Empire and in South-East Asia. The cycle contains 96 months in 2835 days, giving a mean month length of 29.53125 days, or 29d 12h 45m. Though less accurate than the tabular calendars based on a 30-year cycle, it was popular due to the fact that in each cycle the weekdays fall on the same calendar date. In the Dutch East Indies the cycle was reset every 120 years by omitting the intercalary day at the end of the last year, thus resulting in a mean month length equal with that used in the 30-year cycles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "504078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504078", "title": "Diving shot", "text": "Diving shot\n\nA diving shot, or more formally, diving shot line is an item of diving equipment consisting of a weight (the shot), a line and a buoy. The weight is dropped on the dive site. The line connects the weight and the buoy and is used by divers to as a visual and tactile reference to move between the surface and the dive site more safely and more easily, and as a controlled position for in-water staged decompression stops\n\nA \"lazy shot\" is a shot which is suspended above the bottom. It may be tethered to the main shot line at a convenient depth. It is used for decompression and frees the main shot line for other divers. The lazy shot's line does not need to be longer than the decompression depth and is often only deep enough for the longer stops. It only needs a weight heavy enough to provide diver buoyancy control and sufficient buoyancy to avoid being dragged down under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.\n\nThe shot has several purposes. The basic purpose to facilitate control of descent and ascent rate by the diver, and to control the location of the diver during descent and ascent. The line is useful for divers in conditions of low visibility or strong tides where underwater navigation between the surface and the dive site is difficult or on deep dives where a navigation error would dramatically reduce useful underwater time. Divers can use the line to help buoyancy control, to ease long decompression stops and to prevent drift when ascending in a current.\n\nThe buoy marks the dive site for the people on the surface, who are generally on the dive boat, who provide safety cover for the divers. This helps them focus on the place where the divers are likely to return to the surface and helps them return to the dive site more quickly after the boat has moved away from the site.\n\nSeveral configurations are in general use, depending on the conditions.\nThe basic shotline has a line fixed to the weight and the float, and does not compensate for depth changes. This is adequate in many circumstances, and has the advantage of simplicity. If there is any current or wind, the buoy will drift until tension in the line prevents further movement. Large waves will cause the buoy and the top end of the line to bob up and down, jerking on the line.\n\nA bottom tensioned shotline controls the tension of the line in one of two ways:\n\nTop tensioning is achieved by running the line through a loop on the buoy and hanging a small weight on the end. This weight will hang down and double its weight will pull on the float due to the mechanical advantage of the system. This is not usually a major problem, as it is relatively easy to get a buoy of adequate volume. \n\nThe top tensioning system also prevents the line from being pulled up and down by wave action, but instead there is a tensioning weight going up and down twice as much as the buoy, which can be hazardous when the divers are in the depth range of its motion.\n\nA lazy shot is a shotline that does not reach the bottom. The weight hangs suspended from the surface and the line is used to provide a decompression station. A lazy shot may be hung from a buoy, a boat or a structure as circumstances warrant. Though it is not an essential part of the lazy shot, it is often used with a full depth shotline, or when the anchor rope is used as a substitute for a shotline, as it provides a more stable vertical reference than the anchor line, which tends to shift considerably as the boat moves under the influence of wind and wave. When used with the full shotline, the lazy shot provides a place away from the bubbles of other divers where the divers can decompress, and keeps them clear of the shotline if it is used by other divers. The lazy shot may be tethered to the main shotline and unclipped to drift after the last diver has reached it.\n\nA decompression trapeze is a horizontal bar or series of horizontal bars supported at the appropriate decompression stop depths, and provides controlled place for a group of divers to decompress in the water in relative comfort and in less crowded conditions than on a shotline.\nConstruction is basically two lines suspended from the surface, by buoys, a boat, or a structure. The transverse bars are connected to the lines at the depths appropriate to the planned decompression stops, though usually a trapeze is not used for stops of only a few minutes, so several stops may be completed before the diver reaches the trapeze. Spreading the divers out across the current allows them to hold on without getting in each other's way, and lets the bubbles go past without obstructing the other divers' view or disturbing their buoyancy.\nThe bars must either be inherently negatively buoyant or ballasted so that the hang below the surface at the correct depth, and it is common to provide enough weight to compensate for minor irregularities in diver buoyancy control. The decompression trapeze is generally associated with a shotline, and if it is not close-coupled to the shotline, by using the shotline as one of the suspension lines, there will be a line from the shotline to the lowest bar of the trapeze, which will be either horizontal, or slope upwards toward the trapeze, so the divers can follow it without ascending above their decompression ceiling.\n\nWhen a decompression bar is used in a strong current, it may be convenient for the last diver to unclip it from the shotline, so it drifts at the speed of the current, and the drag on the divers is eliminated. The chase boat would accompany the drifting trapeze which would be clearly identified by the supporting buoys.\n\nSome dive teams will hang a spare cylinder of decompression gas on the trapeze, where it will be on hand in case of an emergency. This would normally be pressurised but with a closed valve, so that current pressure on the demand valve will not cause a free flow. More than one second stage can be fitted to allow more than one diver to use it at the same time.\n\nA high volume buoy with a large waterplane area such as a sphere or short cylinder will try to follow the wave profile, this will produce a cyclic jerking load near the surface, making it difficult to maintain a consistent depth at the stops. A spar buoy with a small waterplane area will dip into the water as each wave crest passes, with a far lower variation of tension on the shotline, so divers holding on will be more comfortable. If the spar buoy has insufficient volume for safety, a larger volume buoy can linked to it on a short tether as a backup.\n\nTypically the weight is lead or iron, and weighs around 20 kg (44 lb). To prevent the assembly sinking and being lost, the buoy should provide more buoyancy than is required to make the complete system float. For example, if a 20 kg/44 lb weight is used, the buoy must provide more than 20 kg buoyancy: it needs to be at least 20 litres/4.4 gallons in volume.\n\nSome agencies and codes of practice recommend a buoy that can not be dragged underwater by the divers relying on it for depth control.\n\nIf used in a current, the shot must be prevented from being dragged away. This can be done by attaching it to a small anchor by a short line. Another method used is to tie the shot off to an object on the bottom by a thin line, which can be either released by the last diver, or broken when the shotline is recovered.\n\nThe line should be longer than the depth of the dive site at the deepest state of the tide during the dive, and at least 10 mm (0.4 inch) in diameter. A thick line is used because the shot weight is often lifted by pulling the line by hand and the pressure of a thin line can cause pain and injury to the hands when the shot is recovered. \n\nFloating line, such as polypropylene, although cheap, can foul the propellers of boats and is an entanglement hazard to divers if it is allowed to accumulate near the surface. There are several ways of avoiding this: \n\nLine which sinks will accumulate excess length at the bottom and may snag, making recovery of the shot difficult or impossible.\n\nA large float will go up and down with the passing waves. This can be disconcerting and inconvenient for the divers if they need to hold onto it in a current, as they will to some extent go up and down with the line. This effect is minimised if a small diameter spar buoy is used as the primary buoy to tension the line, as it will tend to react less to the waves, with a large volume safety buoy on a short tether, which will prevent the spar buoy from being dragged down if the tension gets too much.\n\nThe shot is deployed, generally from a boat, after the dive site is located using position fixing such as GPS and an echo sounder.\n\nShots are more difficult to use in strong currents. The weight may drag along the seabed especially if the divers pull on the line as they descend. To avoid this the shot is often positioned upstream of an obstruction at the dive site so the obstruction prevents it dragging. A further problem is caused by diving at slack water; the direction of the current reverses during slack, so although the weight may be securely up current of the obstruction before slack, after the tide turns the weight is down current of the obstruction and may drag. \n\nAt the surface, the direction of the current is indicated by three signs at the buoy: the direction of the line to the weight, a \"horseshoe\" bow-wave on the front of the buoy and a wake at the back of the buoy.\n\nSometimes, two buoys are used at the surface. The second buoy can further indicate the strength and the direction of the current or be misleading because it may indicate the direction of the wind. A second buoy can be used to provide additional buoyancy if one buoy is dragged underwater.\n\nSometimes the line, once at the dive site on the seabed, is tied to the dive site to guard against the weight dragging away from the site. The line itself may be tied to the dive site or a thin \"waster\" line may attach the strong line to the dive site. If a waster is used, the boat at the surface can be used to break the waster at the end of diving before the shot is lifted. If the main line is attached to the dive site, the divers must untie it before ascending at the end of diving otherwise they lose their shot.\n\nIn a current, the buoy may be dragged under the surface by water resistance of the divers holding the line as they ascend and reach shallow water. If this happens divers will not want to descend with the buoy and will prefer to release the shot line and be swept away from the shot. In strong currents divers often decompress on decompression buoys instead of using a shot. \n\nSometimes, a lifting bag is attached to the weight and used to help raise the weight at the end of the dive.\n\n"}
{"id": "504690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504690", "title": "Oranjeboom Brewery", "text": "Oranjeboom Brewery\n\nThe Oranjeboom Brewery () was founded in Rotterdam in 1671. The brewery there closed in 1990, with production shifted to Breda. That brewery was sold to Interbrew in 1995 and was closed in 2004 by InBev, Interbrew's successor. Production of the brand Oranjeboom was moved to the Dommelsch brewery. In October 2013 Oranjeboom was relaunched as a \"quirky\" new European style lager.\n\nThe brewery dates from 1671, and started with the merger of two Rotterdam breweries, De Dissel and van den Oranjeboom; it was originally housed on the Coolvest, in the center of town.\n\nLate 19th-century developments in the Dutch brewing industry all involved the then-new process of brewing lager, which used a yeast with the capability of cool fermenting; this allowed for production year-round, but required significant investments in modern technology and cold storage. In 1872 the brewery was owned by Willem Baartz, who was looking to get into the lager market. Baartz approached Gerard Adriaan Heineken but instead got involved in a new venture that led to the founding of Heineken's Bierbrouwerij Maatschappij. By 1882 Oranjeboom had been sold on to the (Protestant) brewing company \"De Gekroonde Valk\", one of the first breweries in the Netherlands to brew lager. In 1885 a brand-new brewery was opened on Oranjeboomstraat in the Feijenoord district, then a new development south of the city. The city named the street for the brewery, which around the turn of the century was an important employer providing over 200 jobs, and one of the largest breweries in the country. After World War II, several other breweries were bought to meet demand and stay competitive: De Wereld (Raamsdonk, 1948), Wertha (Weert, 1960), Zuidhollandse Bierbrouwerij (The Hague, 1960), Phoenix (Amersfoort, 1961), and Barbarossa (Groningen, 1964). None of these breweries remain.\n\nIn 1967 Oranjeboom was taken over by UK company Allied Breweries, which made an important acquisition in 1968 when it bought the brewery De Drie Hoefijzers in Breda, a town with a long history of beer brewing. The Breda brewery took on the name Oranjeboom. In 1973, the brand Oranjeboom was replaced by Skol, which was deemed to be a more attractive name for the European market, but it was a failure, and the brand name Oranjeboom was reintroduced in 1982. The plant in Rotterdam was closed in 1990, and in 1995 the Breda brewery was sold to Belgian beer giant Interbrew, which modernized the plant, but poor results in 2001 led to the plant's closure in 2004, (at a loss of 335 jobs), with production moved to Belgium and to the (Dutch) Dommelsch Brewery.\n\nWith the exception of the Benelux area the tradename Oranjeboom is owned by United Dutch Breweries. It was previously owned by Allied Breweries of the UK.\n\nThe Oranjeboom brewery mainly produced Oranjeboom pils and other lagers, and also Trio Stout. Oranjeboom Breweries were also the manufacturers of the popular Dutch Gold beer, which is one of the best selling lager beers in drinking hotspots around the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe main beer produced under the brand name is Oranjeboom Premium Pilsner - a 5% ABV lager. There is also an Extra Strong 8.5% ABV version, a Super Strong 12.0% ABV version as well as lower strength and alcohol-free versions and a bokbeer sold under the brand name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "505326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505326", "title": "Counseling psychology", "text": "Counseling psychology\n\nCounseling psychology is a psychological specialty that encompasses research and applied work in several broad domains: counseling process and outcome; supervision and training; career development and counseling; and prevention and health. Some unifying themes among counseling psychologists include a focus on assets and strengths, person–environment interactions, educational and career development, brief interactions, and a focus on intact personalities.\n\nThe term \"counselling\" is of American origin, coined by Rogers, who, lacking a medical qualification was prevented from calling his work psychotherapy. In the U.S., counselling psychology, like many modern psychology specialties, started as a result of World War II. During the war, the U.S. military had a strong need for vocational placement and training. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Veterans Administration created a specialty called \"counseling psychology\", and Division 17 (now known as the Society for Counseling Psychology) of the APA was formed. The Society of Counseling Psychology unites psychologists, students and professionals who are dedicated to promote education and training, practice, scientific investigation, diversity and public interest in the field of professional psychology. This fostered interest in counselor training, and the creation of the first few counseling psychology PhD programs. The first counseling psychology PhD programs were at the University of Minnesota; Ohio State University; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Missouri; Teachers College, Columbia University; and University of Texas at Austin.\n\nIn recent decades, counseling psychology as a profession has expanded and is now represented in numerous countries around the world. Books describing the present international state of the field include the \"Handbook of Counseling and Psychotherapy in an International Context\"; the \"International Handbook of Cross-Cultural Counseling\"; and \"Counseling Around the World: An International Handbook\". Taken together these volumes trace the global history of the field, explore divergent philosophical assumptions, counseling theories, processes, and trends in different countries, and review a variety of global counselor education programs. Moreover, traditional and indigenous treatment and healing methods that may predate modern counseling methods by hundreds of years remain of significance in many non-Western and Western countries.\n\nCounseling psychologists are employed in a variety of settings depending on the services they provide and the client populations they serve. Some are employed in colleges and universities as teachers, supervisors, researchers, and service providers. Others are employed in independent practice providing counseling, psychotherapy, assessment, and consultation services to individuals, couples/families, groups, and organizations. Additional settings in which counseling psychologists practice include community mental health centers, Veterans Administration medical centers and other facilities, family services, health maintenance organizations, rehabilitation agencies, business and industrial organizations and consulting within firms.\n\nThe amount of training required for psychologists differs based on the country in which they are practicing. Typically, a psychologist completes an Undergraduate Degree followed by 5-6 years of further study and/or training, leading to the Ph.D. While both psychologists and psychiatrists offer counselling, psychiatrists must possess a medical degree and thus are able to prescribe medication where psychologists are not.\n\nIn 2017, the median salary for counseling psychologists in the United States was US$88,395.\n\nCounseling psychologists are interested in answering a variety of research questions about counseling process and outcome. Counseling \"process\" refers to how or why counseling happens and progresses. Counseling \"outcome\" addresses whether or not counseling is effective, under what conditions it is effective, and what outcomes are considered effective—such as symptom reduction, behavior change, or quality of life improvement. Topics commonly explored in the study of counseling process and outcome include therapist variables, client variables, the counseling or therapeutic relationship, cultural variables, process and outcome measurement, mechanisms of change, and process and outcome research methods. Classic approaches appeared early in the US in the field of humanistic psychology by Carl Rogers who identified the mission of counseling interview as \"to permit deeper expression that the client would ordinarily allow himself\"\n\nTherapist variables include characteristics of a counselor or psychotherapist, as well as therapist technique, behavior, theoretical orientation and training. In terms of therapist behavior, technique and theoretical orientation, research on adherence to therapy models has found that adherence to a particular model of therapy can be helpful, detrimental, or neutral in terms of impact on outcome.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of research on training and experience suggests that experience level is only slightly related to accuracy in clinical judgment. Higher therapist experience has been found to be related to less anxiety, but also less focus. This suggests that there is still work to be done in terms of training clinicians and measuring successful training.\n\nClient characteristics such as help-seeking attitudes and attachment style have been found to be related to client use of counseling, as well as expectations and outcome. Stigma against mental illness can keep people from acknowledging problems and seeking help. Public stigma has been found to be related to self-stigma, attitudes towards counseling, and willingness to seek help.\n\nIn terms of attachment style, clients with avoidance styles have been found to perceive greater risks and fewer benefits to counseling, and are less likely to seek professional help, than securely attached clients. Those with anxious attachment styles perceive greater benefits as well as risks to counseling. Educating clients about expectations of counseling can improve client satisfaction, treatment duration and outcomes, and is an efficient and cost-effective intervention.\n\nThe relationship between a counselor and client is the feelings and attitudes that a client and therapist have towards one another, and the manner in which those feelings and attitudes are expressed. Some theorists have suggested that the relationship may be thought of in three parts: transference and countertransference, working alliance, and the real—or personal—relationship. Other theorists argue that the concepts of transference and countertransference are outdated and inadequate.\n\nTransference can be described as the client's distorted perceptions of the therapist. This can have a great effect on the therapeutic relationship. For instance, the therapist may have a facial feature that reminds the client of their parent. Because of this association, if the client has significant negative or positive feelings toward their parent, they may project these feelings onto the therapist. This can affect the therapeutic relationship in a few ways. For example, if the client has a very strong bond with their parent, they may see the therapist as a father or mother figure and have a strong connection with the therapist. This can be problematic because as a therapist, it is not ethical to have a more than \"professional\" relationship with a client. It can also be a good thing, because the client may open up greatly to the therapist. In another way, if the client has a very negative relationship with their parent, the client may feel negative feelings toward the therapist. This can then affect the therapeutic relationship as well. For example, the client may have trouble opening up to the therapist because he or she lacks trust in their parent (projecting these feelings of distrust onto the therapist).\n\nAnother theory about the function of the counseling relationship is known as the secure-base hypothesis, which is related to attachment theory. This hypothesis proposes that the counselor acts as a secure base from which clients can explore and then check in with. Secure attachment to one's counselor and secure attachment in general have been found to be related to client exploration. Insecure attachment styles have been found to be related to less session depth than securely attached clients.\n\nCounseling psychologists are interested in how culture relates to help-seeking and counseling process and outcome. Standard surveys exploring the nature of counselling across cultures and various ethnic groups include Counseling Across Cultures by Paul B. Pedersen, Juris G. Draguns, Walter J. Lonner and Joseph E. Trimble, Handbook of Multicultural Counseling by Joseph G. Ponterotto, J. Manueal Casas, Lisa A. Suzuki and Charlene M. Alexander and Handbook of Culture, Therapy, and Healing by Uwe P. Gielen, Jefferson M. Fish and Juris G. Draguns. Janet E. Helms' racial identity model can be useful for understanding how the relationship and counseling process might be affected by the client's and counselor's racial identity. Recent research suggests that clients who are Black are at risk for experiencing racial micro-aggression from counselors who are White.\n\nEfficacy for working with clients who are lesbians, gay men, or bisexual might be related to therapist demographics, gender, sexual identity development, sexual orientation, and professional experience. Clients who have multiple oppressed identities might be especially at-risk for experiencing unhelpful situations with counselors, so counselors might need help with gaining expertise for working with clients who are transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people of color, and other oppressed populations.\n\nGender role socialization can also present issues for clients and counselors. Implications for practice include being aware of stereotypes and biases about male and female identity, roles and behavior such as emotional expression. The APA guidelines for multicultural competence outline expectations for taking culture into account in practice and research.\n\nPerceptions on ethical behaviors vary depending upon geographical location, but ethical mandates are similar throughout the global community. Ethical standards are created to help practitioners, clients and the community avoid any possible harm or potential for harm. The standard ethical behaviors are centered on \"doing no harm\" and preventing harm.\n\nCounselors cannot share any confidential information that is obtained through the counseling process without specific written consent by the client or legal guardian except to prevent clear, imminent danger to the client or others, or when required to do so by a court order. Insurance companies or government programs will also be notified of certain information about your diagnosis and treatment to determine if your care is covered. Those companies and government programs are bound by HIPAA to keep that information strictly confidential.\n\nCounselors are held to a higher standard that most professionals because of the intimacy of their therapeutic delivery. Counselors are not only to avoid fraternizing with their clients. They should avoid dual relationships, and never engage in sexual relationships.\n\nCounselors are to avoid receiving gifts, favors, or trade for therapy. In some communities, it may be avoidable given the economic standing of that community. In cases of children, children and the mentally handicapped, they may feel personally rejected if an offering is something such as a \"cookie\". As counselors, a judgement call must be made, but in a majority of cases, avoiding gifts, favors, and trade can be maintained.\n\nThe National Board for Certified Counselors states that counselors \"shall discuss important considerations to avoid exploitation before entering into a non-counseling relationship with a former client. Important considerations to be discussed include amount of time since counseling service termination, duration of counseling, nature and circumstances of client's counseling, the likelihood that the client will want to resume counseling at some time in the future; circumstances of service termination and possible negative effects or outcomes.\"\n\nCounseling outcome measures might look at a general overview of symptoms, symptoms of specific disorders, or positive outcomes, such as subjective well-being or quality of life. The Outcome Questionnaire-45 is a 45-item self-report measure of psychological distress. An example of disorder-specific measure is the Beck Depression Inventory. The Quality of Life Inventory is a 17-item self-report life satisfaction measure.\n\nResearch about the counseling process and outcome uses a variety of research methodologies to answer questions about if, how, and why counseling works. Quantitative methods include randomly controlled clinical trials, correlation studies over the course of counseling, or laboratory studies about specific counseling process and outcome variables. Qualitative research methods can involve conducting, transcribing and coding interviews; transcribing and/or coding therapy sessions; or fine-grain analysis of single counseling sessions or counseling cases.\n\nCounseling psychologists are trained in graduate programs. Almost all programs grant a PhD, but a few grant a MCouns, MEd, MA, PsyD or EdD. Most doctoral programs take 5–6 years to complete. Graduate work in counseling psychology includes coursework in general psychology and statistics, counseling practice, and research. Students must complete an original dissertation at the end of their graduate training. Students must also complete a one-year full-time internship at an accredited site before earning their doctorate. In order to be licensed to practice, counseling psychologists must gain clinical experience under supervision, and pass a standardized exam.\n\nIn Australia, counseling psychology programs are accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC). To become registered as a counseling psychologist, one must meet the criteria for the area of practice endorsement. This includes an undergraduate degree in the science of psychology, an Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and a Master's or Doctorate degree in counseling psychology. Graduates must then completed a regstrar program to obtain area of practice endorsement and use the tile counseling psychologist. A substantial component of this master's degree is dedicated to individual psychotherapy, family and couples therapy, group therapy, developmental theory and psychopathology.\n\nCounseling psychology includes the study and practice of counselor training and counselor supervision. As researchers, counseling psychologists may investigate what makes training and supervision effective. As practitioners, counseling psychologists may supervise and train a variety of clinicians. Counselor training tends to occur in formal classes and training programs. Part of counselor training may involve counseling clients under the supervision of a licensed clinician. Supervision can also occur between licensed clinicians, as a way to improve clinicians' quality of work and competence with various types of counseling clients.\n\nAs the field of counseling psychology formed in the mid-20th century, initial training models included Robert Carkuff's human relations training model, Norman Kagan's Interpersonal Process Recall, and Allen Ivey's microcounseling skills. Modern training models include Gerard Egan's skilled helper model, and Clara E. Hill's three-stage model (exploration, insight, and action). A recent analysis of studies on counselor training found that modeling, instruction, and feedback are common to most training models, and seem to have medium to large effects on trainees.\n\nLike the models of how clients and therapists interact, there are also models of the interactions between therapists and their supervisors. Edward S. Bordin proposed a model of supervision working alliance similar to his model of therapeutic working alliance. The Integrated Development Model considers the level of a client's motivation/anxiety, autonomy, and self and other awareness. The Systems Approach to Supervision views the relationship between supervisor and supervised as most important, in addition to characteristics of the supervisor's personal characteristics, counseling clients, training setting, as well as the tasks and functions of supervision. The Critical Events in Supervision model focuses on important moments that occur between the supervisor and supervised.\n\nProblems can arise in supervision and training. First, supervisors are liable for malpractice. Also, questions have arisen as far as a supervisor's need for formal training to be a competent supervisor. Recent research suggests that conflicting, multiple relationships can occur between supervisors and clients, such as that of the client, instructor, and clinical supervisor. The occurrence of racial micro-aggression against Black clients suggests potential problems with racial bias in supervision. In general, conflicts between a counselor and his or her own supervisor can arise when supervisors demonstrate disrespect, lack of support, and blaming.\n\nThere are several types of theories of vocational choice and development. These types include trait and factor theories, social cognitive theories, and developmental theories. Two examples of trait and factor theories, also known as person–environment fit, are Holland's theory and the Theory of Work Adjustment.\n\nJohn Holland hypothesized six vocational personality/interest types and six work environment types: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. When a person's vocational interests match his or her work environment types, this is considered congruence. Congruence has been found to predict occupation and college major.\n\nThe Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA), as developed by René Dawis and Lloyd Lofquist, hypothesizes that the correspondence between a worker's needs and the reinforced systems predicts job satisfaction, and that the correspondence between a worker's skills and a job's skill requirements predicts job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and personal satisfaction together should determine how long one remains at a job. When there is a discrepancy between a worker's needs or skills and the job's needs or skills, then change needs to occur either in the worker or the job environment.\n\nSocial Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) has been proposed by Robert D. Lent, Steven D. Brown and Gail Hackett. The theory takes Albert Bandura's work on self-efficacy and expands it to interest development, choice making, and performance. Person variables in SCCT include self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations and personal goals. The model also includes demographics, ability, values, and environment. Efficacy and outcome expectations are theorized to interrelate and influence interest development, which in turn influences choice of goals, and then actions. Environmental supports and barriers also affect goals and actions. Actions lead to performance and choice stability over time.\n\nCareer development theories propose vocational models that include changes throughout the lifespan. Donald Super's model proposes a lifelong five-stage career development process. The stages are growth, exploration, establishment, maintenance, and disengagement. Throughout life, people have many roles that may differ in terms of importance and meaning. Super also theorized that career development is an implementation of self-concept. Gottfredson also proposed a cognitive career decision-making process that develops through the lifespan. The initial stage of career development is hypothesized to be the development of self-image in childhood, as the range of possible roles narrows using criteria such as sex-type, social class, and prestige. During and after adolescence, people take abstract concepts into consideration, such as interests.\n\nCareer counseling may include provision of occupational information, modeling skills, written exercises, and exploration of career goals and plans. Career counseling can also involve the use of personality or career interest assessments, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological type, or the Strong Interest Inventory, which makes use of Holland's theory. Assessments of skills, abilities, and values are also commonly assessed in career counseling.\n\nIn the United States, the premier scholarly journals of the profession are the \"Journal of Counseling Psychology\" and \"The Counseling Psychologist\".\n\nIn Australia, counseling psychology articles are published in the counseling psychology section of the \"Australian Psychologist\".\n\nIn Europe, the scholarly journals of the profession include the \"European Journal of Counselling Psychology\" (under the auspices of the European Association of Counselling Psychology) and the \"Counselling Psychology Review\" (under the auspices of the British Psychological Society). \"Counselling Psychology Quarterly\" is an international interdisciplinary publication of Routledge (part of the Taylor & Francis Group).\n\n"}

A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as \"little\" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as \"Tiny Tim\". Diminutives are often employed as nicknames and pet names, when speaking to small children, and when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative. Beyond the \"diminutive form\" of a single word, a \"diminutive\" can be a multi-word name, such as \"Tiny Tim\" or \"Little Dorrit\".\n\nIn many languages, formation of diminutives by adding suffixes is a productive part of the language. A (example in Polish: → → ; example in Italian: → → ) is a diminutive form with two diminutive suffixes rather than one. While many languages apply a grammatical diminutive to nouns, a few—including Dutch, Latin, Polish, Macedonian, Czech, Russian and Estonian—also use it for adjectives (in Polish: → → ) and even other parts of speech. In English the alteration of meaning is often conveyed through clipping, making the words shorter and more colloquial. Diminutives formed by adding affixes in other languages are often longer and not necessarily understood as colloquial.\n\nDiminutives in isolating languages tend not to use suffixes or prefixes (if such grammatical features even exist). In Chinese, for example, the diminutive is formed by repeating the word, e.g., → and → . In formal Mandarin usage, the use of diminutives are seemingly rare, as they are usually considered to be rather too \"colloquial.\" \n\nIn some contexts, diminutives are also employed in a pejorative sense, to denote that someone or something is weak or childish. For example, one of the last of the Western Roman emperors was named Romulus Augustus, but this was diminuted to \"Romulus Augustulus\" to express his powerlessness.\n\n"}

{"id": "507476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507476", "title": "Midnight Yell Practice", "text": "Midnight Yell Practice\n\nMidnight Yell Practice, known locally as Midnight Yell or Yell Practice, is a tradition at Texas A&M University. Midnight Yell is similar to a pep rally. On the night before each home football game, Midnight Yell takes place in Kyle Field at midnight; two nights before each away game, a Yell Practice (not at midnight) is held near the Quadrangle on the south side of campus. At midnight on the night before an away game Midnight Yell is held in or near the opponent's city.\n\nBesides exciting the crowd, Midnight Yell introduces the student body to any new yells and to practice changes to existing yells. All yell practices are led by the Yell Leaders, a set of five students who are elected to one-year terms by the student body.\n\nYell Practice began in 1913, while A&M was still an all-male military school. Several companies would gather together to \"learn heartily the old time pep.\"\n\nThe first Midnight Yell was held in 1932. Two freshmen asked the senior Yell Leaders to hold a midnight practice so that students would be motivated for the upcoming football game against archrival Texas Longhorns. The Yell Leaders said that while they liked the idea, they couldn't authorize a Yell Practice at that hour. However, they said that they just might \"show up\" at the campus YMCA Building that evening around midnight. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band met them at the YMCA, and soon the bulk of the student body had gathered. The cadets used railroad flares to light the event, and a tradition was born.\n\nSince that first Midnight Yell, the event has been held on the night before each home football game. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band and the five Yell Leaders lead a parade from the Quadrangle, where the Corps dorms are located. Students and alumni line the route from the Quadrangle to Kyle Field, falling into line once those in front of them have passed. Students and alumni gather in the student section of the stands. At midnight, the yell practice begins. The Corps Juniors used to guard Kyle Field all night against students from other schools who may try to pull pranks the night before the game. This job has since been taken over by University Police but only the Corps Juniors are allowed to stand on the track around the Field in recognition of this tradition.\n\nIn a departure from their starched white game-day uniforms, at Midnight Yell the Yell Leaders typically wear painted denim overalls and T-shirts. With the senior Yell Leaders looking on, the junior Yell Leaders assemble at midfield and begin doing pushups. The pushups last for approximately nine minutes (3 songs played by the Aggie Band about 3 minutes each). When the juniors are finished, Reveille, the Texas A&M mascot, is escorted onto the field.\n\nThe five Yell Leaders then arrange themselves in front of the stands and begin leading the yells. All yells are coordinated using hand signals. When the yell is ready to begin, the head Yell Leader gives a signal and the crowd \"humps it,\" with every person leaning forward to maximize the volume of their voices.\n\nDuring the Yell Practice the crowd, which generally numbers 20,000 to 25,000 people, is led in the yells. The school songs \"Aggie War Hymn\" and \"Spirit of Aggieland\" are sung, the Yell Leaders will also tell two fables about how the Aggies are going to beat their opponent the next day.\n\nAt one point during the night the stadium lights are turned off and, traditionally, Aggies are supposed to kiss their dates (called \"mugging down\"). This relates to another student tradition: \"When One Aggie Scores, All Aggies Score.\" When the Aggies score a touch down, safety, or field goal, everyone in the student body who has brought a date to the game kisses his/her date.\n\nIf no date is present, single students light their cigarette lighters, commonly referred to as \"flicking your Bic,\" to make it easier for two dateless people to find each other in the dark.\n\nIf the game is an away game, a yell called an Arch (or Grove) Yell is held on campus the Thursday before the game, and a Midnight yell is held in a location in the away city. For example, if the annual game against the University of Texas is held in Austin the Midnight Yell is held on the steps of the Texas State Capitol. Grove yells were held at The Grove, an outdoor theater near the MSC which was torn down in 2003. Since then, they have been held in front of the twelve arches that mark the entrance to the Corps of Cadets quad area. Arch yells are usually at 7 PM, the attendance is much smaller (usually only the Corps of Cadets) and the tradition of \"mugging down\" is not performed.\n\nAfter a victorious home football game, the Yell Leaders are tackled by the freshmen in the Corps and thrown into Fish Pond. Afterwards, the Aggie Band meets up with them and an informal yell practice ensues on the steps of the YMCA building. Should the Aggies lose (or run out of time) in a football game, a yell practice is held in the stands \"to display the continuing support for the Aggie team and to prepare for the next game.\"\n"}
{"id": "507522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507522", "title": "Aggie Bonfire", "text": "Aggie Bonfire\n\nAggie Bonfire was a long-standing annual tradition at Texas A&M University as part of the college rivalry with the University of Texas at Austin. For 90 years, Texas A&M students—known as Aggies—built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as \"Bonfire\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \"burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.\", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas. The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual college football game. Although early bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed the annual event became more organized. Over the years the bonfire grew to an immense size, setting the world record in 1969. In 1999, the Bonfire collapsed during construction, killing twelve people, eleven students and one former student, and injuring twenty-seven others. The accident led Texas A&M to declare a hiatus on an official Bonfire. However, since 2002, a student-sponsored coalition has constructed an annual unsanctioned, off-campus \"Student Bonfire\" in the spirit of its predecessor.\n\nThe students of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907, to congratulate the football team on a recent win. The first on-campus Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near Thanksgiving Day. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the \"final rally\" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.\n\nFreshmen were expected to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees on the edge of town.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the school paper described Bonfire as \"the greatest event of the football season\". The 1947 Corps handbook stated that \"bonfire symbolizes two things: a burning desire to beat the team from the University of Texas, and the undying flame of love that every loyal Aggie carries in his heart for the school\"; this was often shortened to \"the burning desire to beat the hell out of t.u.\"\nThe Bonfire design changed in 1942. Universal Studios, filming the movie \"We've Never Been Licked\" on the Texas A&M Campus, built a bonfire as a prop for the movie. Their structure used a design similar to a teepee, where all the logs rested against each other in a conical shape. The logs were placed at an angle between 23 and 30 degrees, giving it \"a tremendous vertical and horizontal resistance\". This allowed Bonfire to grow from tall to over tall. Subsequent Aggies adopted the new idea, and the teepee design became standard for Bonfires for the next twenty-five years.\nBeginning in 1952, the bonfires were constructed entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, when a student was struck by a swerving car. For unrelated reasons, that same year the Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the bonfire burned as scheduled.\n\nDuring this period, University of Texas students attempted several stunts, trying to light the stack early, but to no avail. In both 1933 and 1948, students from UT rented an airplane and tried to drop fire bombs onto the stack. In one of these instances, the plane ran low on fuel, and was forced to land at Easterwood Airport in College Station—the wooden portions of the plane found themselves part of Bonfire that year. In 1956, there was an unsuccessful attempt to plant explosives at the Bonfire site, and, in the late 1970s, a College Station police officer was fired after trying to ignite the bonfire several days ahead of schedule. Students spotted the officer before he could succeed and chased him across campus. In 1999, a Longhorn fan hired someone to build a six-foot model airplane designed to carry a bomb into the wood stack to ignite it prematurely. \"He was actually in the process of building that plane when they had the tragedy at bonfire\", Mel Stekoll said. \"At that point, we scrapped the plan. It would have been the next year that we planned to try it.\"\n\nIn 1965, membership in the Corps of Cadets became voluntary for students at Texas A&M. Before, Corps leaders directed construction of Bonfire. However, because the Corps had no authority over the \"non-regs\", or civilian students, a separate Bonfire leadership structure was instituted. The new leaders were designated with colored hard hats, or pots, with the overall leaders known as redpots.\n\nThe first Bonfire built with both Corps and non-reg participation was in 1963. The stack was scheduled to burn only days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Out of respect, the students dismantled the stack. As Head Yell Leader Mike Marlowe explained, \"It is the most we have and the least we can give.\"\n\nIn the following years the structure became more elaborate, and in 1967 the flames could be seen away. In 1969, the stack of logs set the world record for the height of a bonfire at tall. Out of concern for the safety of participants and the community, the university limited the size to tall and in diameter. As an added precaution, nearby campus buildings were equipped with rooftop sprinkler systems. Despite the new height restrictions, in the 1970s, the \"Guinness Book of Records\" listed Aggie Bonfire as the largest Bonfire in the world.\n\nIn 1978, Bonfire shifted from its previous teepee design to a wedding cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged on top of lower stacks. The structure was built around a fortified center pole, made from two telephone poles spliced together by cutting matching notches, approximately long, and with of glue. Four steel plates were bolted to the two poles, and a cable wrapped around the joint and secured to the pole with steel staples. Four perimeter poles were placed away and ropes were stretched between the perimeter poles to center poles and tension placed on them to hold the center pole together. After the center pole was erected, logs were placed vertically around it in a multi-tiered wedding cake design composed of thousands of logs. By 1984, the logs were sloping only 14 degrees. The spiral arrangement of the logs was designed to make Bonfire collapse into itself in a twisting motion, thus protecting spectators. Although the tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight then A&M would win the following day's football game, the introduction of the wedding cake design drastically reduced the time it took for Bonfire to fall, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.\n\nDespite the complexity of the design, there were no formal written instructions or architectural blueprints for the construction of Bonfire. Knowledge on how to build the structure was passed verbally from one redpot to the next. By 1999, the only written documentation on the building of Bonfire was the rough schematic printed on the back of the official Bonfire T-shirt worn by participants from the freshman honors dormitory, Lechner.\n\nWhile the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule. Construction began in late October with \"Cut\", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends. After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during \"Load\", a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus. In early November, crews began \"Stack\", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near the end of stack, known as \"Push\", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants. The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.\n\nDuring Cut, all logs were felled by hand, with students working in teams to chop down each tree with their axes. The manual labor ensured that participants were invested in each log that went into the Bonfire. Once the trees had fallen, brownpots, the \"executive lumberjacks\", used chainsaws to cut limbs and prepare the logs.\n\nTo ensure safety during the Stack period, the organizers maintained a perimeter around the working area, and allowed only safety-trained students through. Cranes, donated by local construction companies, assisted in getting logs onto the upper tiers, and volunteers from those companies were on-hand at all times to offer advice. Emergency medical technicians were also required to be on site at all times and no more than 70 students at a time were allowed on the stack. Once the stack was finished, a burnt-orange outhouse with \"t.u frat house\" painted on the front was placed on top of the stack.\n\nAlthough between two and five thousand students participated in the construction of Bonfire each year, most worked only part-time, and many worked only one or two shifts. Student workers were organized by dormitories or Corps units, with a separate off-campus student team. Many former students participated with teams they belonged to as students. Each team had assigned shifts, although individuals were not limited to working only the assigned shifts. Students working on Bonfire wore \"grodes\"—old T-shirts, jeans, and boots. By tradition, grodes were either not washed until after Bonfire burned or not washed at all.\n\nIn 1983, the city of College Station began manufacturing Austin city limits signs for students to place at the summit of the Bonfire so that students would stop stealing signs from Austin. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band began building the outhouse, ending the tradition of stealing Bonfire's components.\n\nAlthough women were allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was partially rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them as they tried to take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.\n\nInjuries plagued the construction process. In 1981, student Wiley Keith Jopling died after being run over by a tractor at the Cut site. At the 1985 Cut site, one student broke his hip, and, in 1989, another student lost two fingers when logs crushed his hand. Fractures and amputations were rare, but many students suffered cuts, scrapes, or exposure to poison ivy. Hazing, including beatings with ax handles, was common.\n\nThe 1980s also saw increased alcohol consumption during the Bonfire ceremony. In 1988, police issued 140 Minor in Possession (of alcohol) citations and arrested six people. The following year, the local police department brought a paddywagon to the site for the first time, as they anticipated mass arrests for alcohol violations. As many as 150 police officers were on duty during the Bonfire burning from the Texas A&M and College Station police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.\n\nIn 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, representing 17 religious denominations, unanimously approved a resolution asking the university to change Bonfire because of concerns about safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a panel to explore alternatives to Bonfire.\n\nAlthough students protested Bonfire's environmental impact since 1970, no changes were made for decades. In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and in the spring of 1991, they planted 400 trees. The tradition, Aggie Replant, has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.\n\nAfter being held at the Duncan Intramural Fields on the south side of A&M's campus for twenty-seven years, in 1992, Bonfire was relocated to the Polo Fields on the northeast corner of campus. This more isolated site, with a larger area for people to gather, made it a safer location. After heavy rains in 1994, the partially completed Bonfire began to slowly lean to the side as the soil underneath shifted. Student officials had enough warning to clear the area and tear down the Bonfire one week before its scheduled burn date. Nine tractors, two bulldozers, and two forklifts dismantled the stack on October 26, 1994, which, at 70% completed, stood tall and wide.\nStudents and alumni flocked to the Polo Fields, working around the clock, to rebuild the Bonfire in time for the game. It was completed only hours before it was scheduled to burn. After the 1994 Bonfire was burned, two tons of lime were spread on the Polo Fields to stabilize the ground. This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.\n\nIn 1996 a student, Greg White, died in a car accident on his way home from Cut. The student and several companions were riding in the bed of a pickup truck when the driver lost control and the truck rolled. Nine other students were injured.\nIn its later years, students building Bonfire used logs donated by local landowners who wanted their land cleared for construction or farming. Over 8000 logs were used each year in the late 1990s, taking about 5000 students a combined 125,000 man-hours to construct. After being doused in 700 lb (318 kg) of jet fuel, applied by staff members at A&M's Fire Training School, the Yell Leaders, Drum Majors, and Redpots then lit the stack with torches the night before the annual football game against the University of Texas when at home and two nights before the game when it was played in Austin.\n\nThis event was popular among current and former students and people traveled from all over the state and the nation to observe the burning of Bonfire. Hotel rooms within of College Station were booked weeks or months in advance of the date Bonfire burned. Crowds ranged from 30,000 to 70,000 people, depending on the weather and the strength of the Aggie football team. The 1998 Bonfire was broadcast live on Fox Sports Southwest.\n\nAt approximately 2:42 a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, consisting of about 5000 logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58 students and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A&M Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies. In addition to the mutual aid received from the College Station and Bryan, Texas EMS, Fire, and Police Departments, members of Texas Task Force 1, the state's elite emergency response team, arrived to assist the rescue efforts.\n\nA memorial was constructed on the university polo fields, the site of the accident. Construction began in October 2003 and was completed by November 2004. On November 18, 2004, five years following the incident, the Bonfire Memorial was officially dedicated. The memorial is composed of three design elements:\n\nThe memorial design has been recognized by several organizations as an outstanding architectural design and masonry accomplishment. The American Institute of Architects, San Antonio Chapter, recognized the memorial as a winner of the 2005 AIA San Antonio Design Award. The memorial also was recognized as a winner of the 2005 MCAA International Excellence in Masonry Awards.\n\nTo further honor the victims, in 2000, the Aggie Replant Committee planted twelve live oak trees at the Polo Grounds.\n\nShortly after the university officially cancelled Bonfire, students began planning an unofficial bonfire for November 2002. Known as the \"Unity Project\", it became the first unofficial Bonfire since the 1930s. This fire consisted of three piles of wood, with the center stack being high. Despite a lack of official advertisement, over one thousand spectators attended.\n\nThe following year, the unofficial event was rebranded Student Bonfire. Now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Student Bonfire has official bylaws and a Board of Directors comprising former students. The bylaws specify the design that must be used each year, and no changes have been permitted since the first burn in 2003. This design, based on the recommendation of the 2002 university task force and approved by a structural engineer, results in a Bonfire less than half the size of those from the 1960s. In a departure from tradition, every log in the stack touches the ground. To maintain the traditional wedding-cake design, the logs are cut to different heights, with the tallest set reaching high. The lowered height eliminates the need for a spliced center pole. Instead, a single utility pole, sunk into the ground, serves as the center pole. As in the pre-1999 versions of Bonfire, each log is tied to the log next to it with baling wire. To further fortify the structure, aircraft-grade steel cable is wrapped around each tier. For added support, four poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the center pole, each with a steel pipe. These poles are known as Windle-sticks, after Levi Windle, a staunch supporter of Student Bonfire who died in an unrelated accident in 2003.\n\nThe Board changed or eliminated many of the minor traditions that had proliferated during Aggie Bonfire, primarily for safety reasons. Alcohol is no longer permitted, and hazing has been banned. The Bonfire leadership structure has remained in place, although in 2014 only 10 of the 26 dorms were represented by Bonfire crews. Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000–15,000 people and the event is held in Brazos County or one of the surrounding counties. The 2013 Student Bonfire attracted 12,000 people, despite being postponed until January due to flooding.\n\n\nOther sites:\n"}

The confection is mostly sugar, with small amounts of either flavoring or food coloring often being added.\n\nCotton candy is made by heating and liquefying sugar and spinning it out through minute holes. It resolidifies in minutely thin strands of \"sugar glass\".. The final cotton candy contains mostly air, with a typical serving weighing around 1 ounce or 28 grams. It is often served at fairs, circuses, carnivals, and Japanese festivals, and sold on a stick or in a plastic bag. \n\nSimilar light halva confections include the Indian\" sohan papdi\" and \"pootharekulu\", the Persian \"pashmak\", and the Turkish \"pişmaniye\", although the latter is made with flour and water in addition to sugar. Tatar cuisine has similar flour-honey sweet sawdust \"talqysh-kalava\". Similar sweets include Chinese dragon's-beard candy and Korean honey skein \"kkul-tarae\".\n\nSeveral places claim the origin of cotton candy, with some sources tracing it to a form of spun sugar found in Europe in the 19th century. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person. Others suggest versions of spun sugar originated in Italy as early as the 15th century.\n\nMachine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by dentist William Morrison and confectioner John C. Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 World's Fair as \"Fairy Floss\" with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25¢ per box (equivalent to $6 per box today). Joseph Lascaux, a dentist from New Orleans, Louisiana, invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921. In fact, the Lascaux patent named the sweet confection “cotton candy” and the \"fairy floss\" name faded away, although it retains this name in Australia. In the 1970s, an automatic cotton candy machine was created which made the product and packaged it. This made it easier to produce and available to sell at carnivals, fairs, and stores in the 1970s and on.\n\nTootsie Roll Industries of Canada Ltd., the world's largest cotton-candy manufacturer, makes a bagged, fruit-flavored version called Fluffy Stuff.\n\nThe United States declared National Cotton Candy Day to be on December 7.\n\nTypical machines used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small \"sugar reserve\" bowl into which a charge of granulated, colored sugar (or separate sugar and food coloring) is poured. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.\n\nThe molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.\n\nModern innovations in cotton-candy equipment include vending machines which automatically produce single servings of the product, developed in Taiwan, and lighted or glowing sticks.\n\nThe source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring transforms the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white. In the US, what's known as 'floss sugar' is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate – 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla', both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy also comes out purple, when mixed, making a significant favorite at fairs. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949, and since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton-candy machines and much of the floss sugar in the US.\n\nTypically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than 'blue', the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow (\"cotton-candy flavored ice cream\") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy that people typically only get to experience on vacation or holidays. Pink bubble gum went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and 'bubble gum flavor' often shows up in the same product categories as 'cotton candy flavor'.\n\nIn 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, the creations and innovations of this machine have become greater and greater. They range in sizes from counter-top accessible to party and carnival size. Modern machines that are made for commercial use can hold up to of sugar and have compartments for storage of extra flavors. The rotating bowl at the top spins at 3,450 revolutions per minute.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "508057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508057", "title": "Property (philosophy)", "text": "Property (philosophy)\n\nIn mathematics, logic, and philosophy, a property is a characteristic of an object; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the philosophical concept of class in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the problem of universals. The terms attribute and quality have similar meanings.\n\nIn modern analytic philosophy there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?\nA realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known universals. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.\n\nThe anti-realist position, often referred to as nominalism claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.\n\nAccording to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.\n\nDispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers. Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).\n\nSeveral intermediary positions exist. The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.\n\n Property dualism describes a category of positions in the philosophy of mind which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).\n\nThis stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties. Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that \"something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality.\"\n\nIn classical Aristotelian terminology, a \"property\" (Greek: \"idion\", Latin: \"proprium\") is one of the predicables. It is a non-essential quality of a species (like an accident), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, \"ability to laugh\" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, \"laughter\" is not an \"essential\" quality of the species \"human\", whose Aristotelian definition of \"rational animal\" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, \"properties\" are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.\n\nA property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc. A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of identity.\n\nDaniel Dennett distinguishes between \"lovely\" properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they\nrequire an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and \"suspect\" properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)\n\nThe ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a predicate to a subject. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as Russell's paradox and the Grelling–Nelson paradox. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates \"..weighs more than 1.9 kilos\", \"..weighs more than 1.8 kilos\", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as \"is an individual\", or \"has some properties\" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called \"Cambridge properties\" as legitimate.\n\nAn intrinsic property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or relational) property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an attribute, since the value of that property is \"given\" to the object via its relation with another object. (See the etymology of the word on Wiktionary.) For example, mass is a physical intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. other examples are the \"name\" of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.\n\nA relation is often considered to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation \".. is taller than ..\" holds \"between\" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.\n\nIt is widely accepted that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance \"A is heavier than B\" is a relational \"predicate\", but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations. Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.\n\n\n"}

The ingredients of traditional soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk in the dough contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. An advantage of quick breads is their ability to be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and temperature control needed for traditional yeast breads.\n\nDuring the early years of European settlement of the Americas, settlers and some groups of Indigenous peoples of the Americas used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. In the US, soda breads were first publicised by Amelia Simmons as a quick and cheap method of bread making in her book \"American Cookery\", published in 1796. By 1824, \"The Virginia Housewife\" by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.\n\nIn Europe, soda breads began to appear in the mid-19th century when bicarbonate of soda first became available for use as a raising agent. Breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid became popular in Austria, Britain, Ireland and Poland. Traditional soda bread, eaten in Serbian cuisine, also uses bicarbonate of soda, particularly the traditional \"česnica\" (Serbian Cyrillic: Чесница), a soda bread made at Christmas.\n\nIn Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.\n\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as \"wheaten bread\" and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as \"brown bread\" and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as \"fadge\".\n\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or \"soda farls\" in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.\n\nIn Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: \"fardel\", \"a fourth\"), \"soda scones\", or \"soda farls\", using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.\n\nBannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: \"girdle\"). The most authentic versions are unleavened, but from the early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, or a combination of baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.\n\nThe traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: \"tattie scone\").\n\nIn Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the \"česnica\" is rotated three times counter-clockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. Before baking, the upper surface of the loaf may be inscribed with various symbols, such as a Christogram, or stars, circles, and impressions of keys or combs.\n\nDamper is a traditional Australian bread prepared in a similar style to the pan breads found in North American and native Inuit cuisine. First documented in 1827 and prepared by farm-men, damper was a quick and easy way to prepare bread in the Australian bush. The word \"damper\" derives from the English word \"to snack\" or to dampen the flour in the fire of one's appetite.\n\n\n"}

The name comes from the Spanish verb , and literally translates as \"enbreaded\", that is, wrapped or coated in bread.\n\nEmpanadas are made by folding dough over a stuffing, which may consist of meat, cheese, corn, or other ingredients.\n\nEmpanadas trace back their origins to the northwest region of Spain, Galicia. A cookbook published in Catalan in 1520, \"Libre del Coch\" by Robert de Nola, mentions empanadas filled with seafood in the recipes for Catalan, Italian, French, and Arabian food.\n\nArgentine empanadas are often served during parties and festivals as a starter or main course. Shops specialize in freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings.\n\nThe dough is made with wheat flour and beef drippings for the fillings which differs from province to province. Some places use chicken, and some places beef (cubed or ground depending on the region) spiced with cumin and paprika. Some other fillings are onion, boiled egg, olives, or raisins. Empanadas can be baked or fried. It also can contain ham, fish, \"humita\" (sweetcorn with white sauce), or spinach; a fruit filling is used to create a dessert empanada. For the interior regions, they can be spiced with peppers.\n\nIn those places (usually take-out shops) where several types are served, a \"repulgue\", or pattern, is added to the pastry fold to distinguish the varieties (although it is more common nowadays to burn a letter – an abbreviated indication of the filling – into the dough). In larger cities, empanadas are eaten more as take-away food, sourced from restaurants specializing in this dish. They usually carry dozens of different varieties, which is not the case in northern provinces, where empanadas are usually made at home, with more traditional recipes.\n\nDuring Lent and Easter, \"empanadas de Cuaresma\" fillings with fish (usually dogfish or tuna) are popular.\n\nIn Belize, empanadas are known as \"panades\". They are made with masa (corn dough) and typically stuffed with fish, chicken, or beans. They are usually deep fried and served with a cabbage or salsa topping. Panades are frequently sold as street food.\n\nCape Verde cuisine features the \"pastel\", as well. Cape Verdean \"pastéis\" are often filled with spicy tuna fish. One particular variety, the \"pastel com o diabo dentro\" (literally: Pastel with the devil within), is particularly spicy, and is made with a dough made from sweet potatoes and cornmeal.\n\nThe empanada is considered the most symbolic food of the country. Salvador Allende, the President of Chile from 1970 to 1973, emphasized the national character of his political project saying that it would be a \"revolution with the flavor of red wine, and the scent of an empanada\".\n\nEating empanadas, especially the meat ones called \"empanadas de pino\", becomes more popular during September, the month that Chile celebrates las fiestas patrias or their independence. They are eaten during meals like asados or Chilean barbeques, and are accompanied with drinks like la chicha and red wine.\n\nMeat empanadas (\"de pino\") are filled with ground beef, fried with white onion and are seasoned with garlic, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and sometimes raisins. This version is known as the typical baked Chilean empanada, although it can also be fried. \n\nSeafood empanadas are filled with crab, clams, sea snails, or special oysters called crassostrea and cheese. Different seafood can be used, and they are mixed with chopped white onion.\n\nFilipino empanadas usually contain ground beef, pork or chicken, potatoes, chopped onions, and raisins (somewhat similar to the Cuban \"picadillo\") in a somewhat sweet, wheat flour bread. There are two kinds available: the baked sort and the flaky fried type. To lower costs, potatoes are often added as an extender, while another filling is \"kutsay\", or garlic chives (\"kutsay\" in Cebuano and Tagalog; 韭菜 \"kú-chhài\" in Lan-nang).\n\nEmpanadas in the northern part of the Ilocos are different. These usually have savoury fillings of green papaya, mung beans, and sometimes chopped Ilocano sausage (\"chorizo\") and egg yolk. \n\nThe 'Mpanatigghi are stuffed, consisting of halfmoon-shaped panzarotti filled with a mixture of almonds, walnuts, chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, cloves and minced beef. These are typical of Modica, in the province of Ragusa, Sicily. They are also known as \"impanatiglie\" or \"dolce di carne\" (pasty of meat).\n\nThey were probably introduced by the Spaniards during their rule in Sicily which took place in the sixteenth century; this is suggested from the etymology of the name which comes from the Spanish \"empanadas or empanadillas\" (empanada), as well as from the somewhat unusual combination of meat and chocolate, which occurs several times in the Spanish cuisine. In past centuries for the preparation of 'mpanatigghi game meat was used but today beef is used.\n\nEmpanadas, mainly based on South American recipes, are widely available in New York City, New Jersey, and Miami from food carts, food trucks, and restaurants. Empanadas are usually found in U.S. areas with a large Hispanic population, like San Antonio and Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Being an economical hodgepodge, the same approach is often taken with fried noodles or \"pyttipanna\" as well. Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.\n\nMany popular varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In Greater China, the most famous varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese chāhan is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. Korean bokkeum-bap in general is not, although there is a Korean Chinese variety of bokkeum-bap. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of American restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, there are variations of fried rice in Middle and South Americas. Some of these variations include Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao. \n\nFried rice is a popular street food in Asia. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialize in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street hawkers moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes.\n\nCooked rice is the primary ingredient, with myriad of additional ingredients (sometimes and/or preferably, overnight leftovers), such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), mushrooms, among others. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Various cooking oils, such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce and/or many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arroz frito\" is a denomination used in the Spanish speaking world, meaning \"fried rice\", with adjectives describing the Chinese-inspired varieties, e.g. \"arroz chino, arroz cantonés\", or local specialties \"arroz chaufa/chaulafán/chaufán/chofán, arroz frito tres delicias\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "509495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509495", "title": "Chicago-style pizza", "text": "Chicago-style pizza\n\nChicago-style pizza is pizza prepared according to several different styles developed in Chicago. The most famous is deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge which provides ample space for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.\n\nAccording to Tim Samuelson, Chicago's official cultural historian, there is not enough documentation to determine with certainty who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, in 1943, by Uno's founder Ike Sewell. However, a 1956 article from the \"Chicago Daily News\" asserts that Uno's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe.\n\nThe primary difference between deep-dish pizza and most other forms of pizza is that, as the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flatbread. Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.\n\nDeep-dish pizza is baked in a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.\n\nThe thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time, which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled \"upside-down\" from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced mozzarella), followed by various meat options such as pepperoni or sausage, the latter of which sometimes is in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as onions, mushrooms and bell peppers are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer; though sometimes, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese is added for extra flavor. It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents moisture from the sauce and toppings from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.\n\nSome Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their pizzas, partially baked and frozen, within the continental United States.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, Nancy's Pizza, founded by Rocco Palese, and Giordano's Pizzeria, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep-dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza. Palese based his creation on his mother's recipe for scarciedda, an Italian Easter pie from his hometown of Potenza. \"Chicago Magazine\" articles featuring Nancy's Pizza and Giordano's stuffed pizza popularized the dish.\n\nStuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into. A stuffed pizza generally has much deeper topping density than any other type of pizza. As with deep-dish pizza, a deep layer of dough forms a bowl in a high-sided pan and the toppings and cheese are added. Then, an additional layer of dough goes on top and is pressed to the sides of the crust.\n\nAt this stage, the thin dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke a small hole in the top of the \"lid\" to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the top crust before the pizza is baked.\nThere is also a style of thin-crust pizza found in Chicago and throughout the rest of the Midwest. The crust is thin and firm enough to have a noticeable crunch, unlike a New York-style pizza. This pizza is cut into squares, also known as \"tavern style\" or \"party cut\", as opposed to being cut into wedges. Among locals, thin-crust actually outsells the more widely known deep-dish style.\n\nIn most of the United States, the most popular pizza topping is pepperoni, but in Chicago the most popular topping is sausage.\n\n"}

Seasonings may be added to the top. Variations may include reversing the layering of ingredients with potatoes at the bottom, then meat, topped with cream corn; adding diced bell peppers to the ground beef, and serving the dish with pickled eggs or beets. Once served, ketchup may be added.\n\nPâté Chinois is not a Chinese recipe. It may simply be an adaptation of \"Shepherd's Pie\", but one possible explanation for the Chinese reference is that it was introduced to Canadian railway workers by Chinese cooks during the building of the North American railroads in the late 19th century. These cooks made it under instruction from the railway bosses (of British origin) as an easily prepared, inexpensive version of the popular cottage pie, with the sauce in the tinned creamed corn serving as a substitute for the gravy.\n\nThe French Canadian railway workers became fond of it and brought the recipe back with them to their home communities. From there, it was brought to the textile mill communities of Maine (Lewiston and Biddeford), New Hampshire (Manchester), Massachusetts (e.g., Lowell and Lawrence) and Rhode Island (Woonsocket) where many French Canadians immigrated to work in the mills during the early 20th century.\n\nAnother origin story has the dish connected to the town of South China, Maine.\n\nIn the Québécois humorous television program \"La Petite Vie\", pâté chinois is used to show one of the characters' abysmal lack of common sense as she regularly fails to properly prepare it, for example, by laying the three ingredients side by side instead of layering them, or forgetting to mash the potatoes.\n\n\n"}

It was first introduced in 1952 by the brewery Simonds Farsons Cisk, and continued to be produced by Farsons in Attard, Malta.\n\nKinnie is brown in colour, and is drunk straight or mixed with alcohol. It holds a reputation for being Malta's favourite non-alcoholic beverage, sometimes even called the 'national soft drink'.\n\nKinnie is the brainchild of Simonds Farsons Cisk's managing director Anthony Miceli Farrugia and was first produced in 1952 as an alternative to the cola drinks that proliferated in post-war Europe, specifically Coca-Cola.

They are assistants to their department heads, the gaffer (in charge of electricals) and the key grip (lighting and rigging), respectively. In short, the best boy acts as the foreman for his department. A woman who performs the duties of a best boy may be called best girl.\n\nBest boys are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the unit production manager and coordinator of their department.\n\nThe best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on break or otherwise away from the set.\n\nOn films with very small crews, the electric (lighting) department often consists of only a gaffer, a best boy, and a few electricians. The grip department may include only a key grip, a best boy, and a few grips. Large-scale productions such as major films commonly include full-time rigging and second unit crews, and in total may hire many dozens of grips or electricians at one time.\n\nIt's unclear why this term came to be used as a job title on film sets. As OED says, \"It has been suggested that it originated as a term for a master's most able apprentice, or alternatively that it was transferred from earlier use for a member of a ship's crew, but confirmatory evidence for either of these theories appears to be lacking.\" The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is 1931 from the \"Albuquerque Journal\": \"Among the electricians .. the department head is the gaffer, his first assistant is the best boy.\"\n\nAs the gaffer is sometimes credited as the chief lighting technician, the best boy electric is sometimes credited as the assistant chief lighting technician.\n\nThe title is accepted for use in credits by the BBC.\n\nThe end credits of the 1980 comedy film \"Airplane!\" named the Best Boy, then the next line was \"Worst Boy\", naming Adolf Hitler in that position.\n\nMany French language films made in Canada use \"Best Boy\" in the credits. The term has been known to appear in the credits of some French films made in France, but it has not been known to appear in Belgian or Swiss films.\n\nThe German film \"Auf der anderen Seite\" (\"The Edge of Heaven\"), which takes place in Germany and Turkey, uses the term \"Best Boy\" in its German credits.

{"id": "513091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513091", "title": "Single-nucleotide polymorphism", "text": "Single-nucleotide polymorphism\n\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism, often abbreviated to SNP (; plural ), is a substitution of a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome, where each variation is present to some appreciable degree within a population (e.g. > 1%).\n\nFor example, at a specific base position in the human genome, the C nucleotide may appear in most individuals, but in a minority of individuals, the position is occupied by an A. This means that there is a SNP at this specific position, and the two possible nucleotide variations – C or A – are said to be alleles for this position.\n\nSNPs underlie differences in our susceptibility to a wide range of diseases (e.g. – sickle-cell anemia, β-thalassemia and cystic fibrosis result from SNPs). The severity of illness and the way the body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a single-base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is associated with a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nA single-nucleotide variant (SNV) is a variation in a single nucleotide without any limitations of frequency and may arise in somatic cells. A somatic single-nucleotide variation (e.g., caused by cancer) may also be called a single-nucleotide alteration.\n\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms may fall within coding sequences of genes, non-coding regions of genes, or in the intergenic regions (regions between genes). SNPs within a coding sequence do not necessarily change the amino acid sequence of the protein that is produced, due to degeneracy of the genetic code.\n\nSNPs in the coding region are of two types: synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs do not affect the protein sequence, while nonsynonymous SNPs change the amino acid sequence of protein. The nonsynonymous SNPs are of two types: missense and nonsense.\n\nSNPs that are not in protein-coding regions may still affect gene splicing, transcription factor binding, messenger RNA degradation, or the sequence of noncoding RNA. Gene expression affected by this type of SNP is referred to as an eSNP (expression SNP) and may be upstream or downstream from the gene.\n\n\nMore than 84 million SNPs have been found across humans from multiple populations. A typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4 to 5 million sites, most of which (more than 99.9%) consist of SNPs and short indels.\n\nThe genomic distribution of SNPs is not homogenous; SNPs occur in non-coding regions more frequently than in coding regions or, in general, where natural selection is acting and \"fixing\" the allele (eliminating other variants) of the SNP that constitutes the most favorable genetic adaptation. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also determine SNP density.\n\nSNP density can be predicted by the presence of microsatellites: AT microsatellites in particular are potent predictors of SNP density, with long (AT)(n) repeat tracts tending to be found in regions of significantly reduced SNP density and low GC content.\n\nThere are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another. Within a population, SNPs can be assigned a minor allele frequency — the lowest allele frequency at a locus that is observed in a particular population. This is simply the lesser of the two allele frequencies for single-nucleotide polymorphisms.\n\nVariations in the DNA sequences of humans can affect how humans develop diseases and respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs, vaccines, and other agents. SNPs are also critical for personalized medicine. Examples include biomedical research, forensics, pharmacogenetics, and disease causation, as outlined below.\n\nSNPs' greatest importance in biomedical research is for comparing regions of the genome between cohorts (such as with matched cohorts with and without a disease) in genome-wide association studies. SNPs have been used in genome-wide association studies as high-resolution markers in gene mapping related to diseases or normal traits. SNPs without an observable impact on the phenotype (so called silent mutations) are still useful as genetic markers in genome-wide association studies, because of their quantity and the stable inheritance over generations.\n\nSNPs were used initially for matching a forensic DNA sample to a suspect but it has been phased out with development of STR-based DNA fingerprinting techniques. In the future SNPs may be used in forensics for some phenotypic clues like eye color, hair color, ethnicity, etc. Kidd et al. have demonstrated that a panel of 19 SNPs can identify the ethnic group with good probability of match (Pm = 10^-7) in 40 population groups studied. One example of how this might potentially be useful is in the area of artistic reconstruction of possible premortem appearances of skeletonized remains of unknown individuals. Although a facial reconstruction can be fairly accurate based strictly upon anthropological features, other data that might allow a more accurate representation include eye color, skin color, hair color, etc.\n\nIn a situation with a low amount of forensic sample or a degraded sample, SNP methods can be a good alternative to STR methods due to the abundance of potential markers, amenability to automation, and potential reduction of required fragment length to only 60-80 bp. In the absence of a STR match in DNA profile database; different SNPs can be used to get clues regarding ethnicity, phenotype, lineage, and even identity.\n\nSome SNPs are associated with the metabolism of different drugs. The association of a wide range of human diseases like cancer, infectious diseases (AIDS, leprosy, hepatitis, etc.) autoimmune, neuropsychiatric and many other diseases with different SNPs can be made as relevant pharmacogenomic targets for drug therapy.\n\nA single SNP may cause a Mendelian disease, though for complex diseases, SNPs do not usually function individually, rather, they work in coordination with other SNPs to manifest a disease condition as has been seen in Osteoporosis. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis.\n\nAll types of SNPs can have an observable phenotype or can result in disease:\n\n\nAs there are for genes, bioinformatics databases exist for SNPs. \n\nThe International SNP Map working group mapped the sequence flanking each SNP by alignment to the genomic sequence of large-insert clones in Genebank. These alignments were converted to chromosomal coordinates that is shown in Table 1. This list has greatly increased since, with, for instance, the Kaviar database now listing 162 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs). \nThe nomenclature for SNPs can be confusing: several variations can exist for an individual SNP and consensus has not yet been achieved. One approach is to write SNPs with a prefix, period and \"greater than\" sign showing the wild-type and altered nucleotide or amino acid; for example, c.76A>T. SNPs are frequently referred to by their dbSNP rs number, as in the examples above.\n\nSNPs are usually biallelic and thus easily assayed. Analytical methods to discover novel SNPs and detect known SNPs include:\n\n\nAn important group of SNPs are those that corresponds to missense mutations causing amino acid change on protein level. Point mutation of particular residue can have different effect on protein function (from no effect to complete disruption its function). Usually, change in amino acids with similar size and physico-chemical properties (e.g. substitution from leucine to valine) has mild effect, and opposite. Similarly, if SNP disrupts secondary structure elements (e.g. substitution to proline in alpha helix region) such mutation usually may affect whole protein structure and function. Using those simple and many other machine learning derived rules a group of programs for the prediction of SNP effect was developed:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "513883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513883", "title": "Northbridge (computing)", "text": "Northbridge (computing)\n\nA northbridge or host bridge is one of the two chips in the core logic chipset architecture on a PC motherboard, the other being the southbridge. Unlike the southbridge, northbridge is connected directly to the CPU via the front-side bus (FSB) and is thus responsible for tasks that require the highest performance. The northbridge is usually paired with a southbridge, also known as I/O controller hub. In systems where they are included, these two chips manage communications between the CPU and other parts of the motherboard, and constitute the core logic chipset of the PC motherboard.\n\nOn older Intel based PCs, the northbridge was also named external memory controller hub (\"MCH\") or graphics and memory controller hub (\"GMCH\") if equipped with integrated graphics. Increasingly these functions became integrated into the CPU chip itself, beginning with memory and graphics controllers. For Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Accelerated Processing Unit processors introduced in 2011, all of the functions of the northbridge reside on the CPU, while AMD FX CPUs still require external northbridge and southbridge chips.\n\nSeparating the different functions into the CPU, northbridge, and southbridge chips was due to the difficulty of integrating all components onto a single chip. In some instances, the northbridge and southbridge functions have been combined onto one die when design complexity and fabrication processes permitted it; for example, the Nvidia GeForce 320M in the 2010 MacBook Air is a northbridge/southbridge/GPU combo chip.\n\nAs CPU speeds increased over time, a bottleneck eventually emerged between the processor and the motherboard, due to limitations caused by data transmission between the CPU and its support chipset. Accordingly, starting with the AMD Athlon64 series CPUs (based on the Opteron), a new architecture was used where some functions of the north- and southbridge chips were moved to the CPU. Modern Intel Core processors have the northbridge integrated on the CPU die, where it is known as the uncore or system agent.\n\nThe northbridge typically handles communications among the CPU, in some cases RAM, and PCI Express (or AGP) video cards, and the southbridge. Some northbridges also contain integrated video controllers, also known as a Graphics and Memory Controller Hub (GMCH) in Intel systems. Because different processors and RAM require different signaling, a given northbridge will typically work with only one or two classes of CPUs and generally only one type of RAM.\n\nThere are a few chipsets that support two types of RAM (generally these are available when there is a shift to a new standard). For example, the northbridge from the Nvidia nForce2 chipset will only work with Socket A processors combined with DDR SDRAM; the Intel i875 chipset will only work with systems using Pentium 4 processors or Celeron processors that have a clock speed greater than 1.3 GHz and utilize DDR SDRAM, and the Intel i915g chipset only works with the Intel Pentium 4 and the Celeron, but it can use DDR or DDR2 memory.\n\nThe name is derived from drawing the architecture in the fashion of a map. The CPU would be at the top of the map comparable to due north on most general purpose geographical maps. The CPU would be connected to the chipset via a fast bridge (the northbridge) located north of other system devices as drawn. The northbridge would then be connected to the rest of the chipset via a slow bridge (the southbridge) located south of other system devices as drawn.\n\nThe northbridge plays an important part in how far a computer can be overclocked, as its frequency is commonly used as a baseline for the CPU to establish its own operating frequency. This chip typically gets hotter as processor speed becomes faster, requiring more cooling. There is a limit to CPU overclocking, as digital circuits are limited by physical factors such as rise, fall, delay and storage times of the transistors, current gain bandwidth product, parasitic capacitance, and propagation delay, which increases with (among other factors) operating temperature; consequently most overclocking applications have software-imposed limits on the multiplier and external clock setting. Additionally, heat is a major limiting factor, as higher voltages are needed to properly activate field effect transistors inside CPUs and this higher voltage produces larger amounts of heat, requiring greater thermal solutions on the die.\n\nThe overall trend in processor design has been to integrate more functions onto fewer components, which decreases overall motherboard cost and improves performance. The memory controller, which handles communication between the CPU and RAM, was moved onto the processor die by AMD beginning with their AMD64 processors and by Intel with their Nehalem processors. One of the advantages of having the memory controller integrated on the CPU die is to reduce latency from the CPU to memory.\n\nAnother example of this kind of change is Nvidia's nForce3 for AMD64 systems. It combines all of the features of a normal southbridge with an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) port and connects directly to the CPU. On nForce4 boards it was marketed as a media communications processor (MCP).\n\nAMD Accelerated Processing Unit processors feature full integration of northbridge functions onto the CPU chip, along with processor cores, memory controller and graphics processing unit (GPU). This was an evolution of the AMD64, since the memory controller was integrated on the CPU die in the AMD64.\n\nThe northbridge was replaced by the system agent introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture in 2011, which essentially handles all previous Northbridge functions. Intel’s Sandy Bridge processors feature full integration of northbridge functions onto the CPU chip, along with processor cores, memory controller and graphics processing unit (GPU). This was a further evolution of the Westmere architecture, which also featured a CPU and GPU in the same package.\n\n"}

The southbridge typically implements the slower capabilities of the motherboard in a northbridge/southbridge chipset computer architecture. In systems with Intel chipsets, the southbridge is named I/O Controller Hub (ICH), while AMD has named its southbridge Fusion Controller Hub (FCH) since the introduction of its Fusion AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).\n\nThe southbridge can usually be distinguished from the northbridge by not being directly connected to the CPU. Rather, the northbridge ties the southbridge to the CPU. Through the use of controller integrated channel circuitry, the northbridge can directly link signals from the I/O units to the CPU for data control and access.\n\nDue to the push for system-on-chip (SoC) processors, modern devices increasingly have the northbridge integrated into the CPU die itself; examples are Intel's Sandy Bridge and AMD's Fusion processors, both released in 2011. The southbridge became redundant and it was replaced by the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) architecture introduced with the Intel 5 Series chipset in 2008. All southbridge features and remaining I/O functions are managed by the PCH which is directly connected to the CPU via the Direct Media Interface (DMI).\n\nA southbridge chipset handled all of a computer's I/O functions, such as USB, audio, serial, the system BIOS, the ISA bus, the interrupt controller and the IDE channels. Different combinations of Southbridge and Northbridge chips are possible, but these two kinds of chips must be designed to work together; there is no industry-wide standard for interoperability between different core logic chipset designs. Traditionally, the interface between a northbridge and southbridge was the PCI bus. The main bridging interfaces used now are DMI (Intel) and UMI (AMD).\n\nThe name is derived from representing the architecture in the fashion of a map and was first described as such with the introduction of the PCI Local Bus Architecture in 1991. At Intel, the authors of the PCI specification viewed the PCI local bus as being at the very centre of the PC platform architecture (i.e., at the Equator).\n\nThe northbridge extends to the north of the PCI bus backbone in support of CPU, memory/cache, and other performance-critical capabilities. Likewise the southbridge extends to the south of the PCI bus backbone and bridges to less performance-critical I/O capabilities such as the disk interface, audio, etc.\n\nThe CPU is located at the top of the map at due north. The CPU is connected to the chipset via a fast bridge (the northbridge) located \"north\" of other system devices as drawn. The northbridge is connected to the rest of the chipset via a slow bridge (the southbridge) located \"south\" of other system devices as drawn.\n\nAlthough the current PC platform architecture has replaced the PCI bus backbone with faster I/O backbones, the bridge naming convention remains.\n\nThe functionality found in a contemporary southbridge includes:\n\nOptionally, a southbridge also includes support for Ethernet, RAID, USB, audio codec, and FireWire. Where support is provided for non-USB keyboard, mouse, and serial ports, a machine normally does so through a device referred to as a Super I/O; still more rarely, a southbridge may directly support the keyboard, mouse, and serial ports.\n\n"}

Tolkien, Moriquendi is a Quenya word meaning \"Dark-folk\", but often translated \"Elves of Darkness\" or \"Dark-elves\". This name has a long internal history.\n\nThere existed two old elvish compounds in the \"Quenderin\" language, or Primitive Quendian with \"*kwendī\" \"Elves\": \"*kala-kwendī\" and \"*mori-kwendī\", meaning the \"Light-folk\" and the \"Dark-folk\". These two words go back to the time before the Sundering of the Elves, or rather to the time of the debate among them over the invitation by the Valar to migrate to Valinor. Both words were made by the party favourable to the Vala Oromë, and referred originally to Elves who desired the Light of Valinor versus Elves who did not wish to leave Middle-earth. \"*Mori-kwendī\" had from the beginning a negative sense, implying that these Elves willingly tolerated the shadows Melkor had put upon Middle-earth.\n\nThe Quenya forms became \"Calaquendi\" and \"Moriquendi\" (a rare singular is once recorded \"Moriquen\"). In Quenya the term \"Calaquendi\" applied only to the Elves who actually lived (or had lived) in Eldamar; and the Moriquendi included all other Elves, whether or not they had participated in the March to Valinor. The Moriquendi were regarded as greatly inferior by the Calaquendi, who lived in the Light of the Two Trees, and had also received great knowledge and powers by living with the Valar and Maiar.\n\nIn Exilic Quenya the Noldor did not make much use of the terms \"Calaquendi\" or \"Moriquendi\", which were rather offensive to the Sindar of Beleriand. A new politically correct name was coined to replace the obsolescent term \"Moriquendi\": Úmanyar, \"those not of Aman\".\n\nTom Shippey has identified the concept of Tolkien's \"Light elves\" and \"Dark elves\" as being inspired by the medieval Icelandic \"Prose Edda\" by Snorri Sturluson which distinguishes between \"ljósálfar \" (light-elves) and \"dökkálfar\" (dark-elves). Snorri writes that the dark-elves are \"black\", \"svart\", but simultaneously he writes of all \"black-elves\" being dwarves. This contradiction was first investigated in the 19th century by German linguist Jacob Grimm and Danish philosopher N. F. S. Grundtvig. Grimm noted a dualism between good and evil in the Edda's light-elves and dark-elves, like Grundtvig, but he raised the question whether three kinds of Norse elves should be assumed. Shippey suggests that these discussions must have been known to Tolkien and that \"one of the starting points of his whole developed mythology was this problem in nomenclature, this apparent contradiction in ancient texts...\".\n\nA first concept of Eöl the Dark Elf was written by Tolkien in 1917 in the tale \"The Fall of Gondolin\" and was eventually published in \"The Silmarillion\" by Christopher Tolkien. \"Dark Elf\" is, however, a personal appellation resulting from Eöl dwelling in a shaded forest. It was in the \"Quenta Silmarillion\" which was written in the 1930s that Tolkien first used the term Dark-elves for those elves who were lost on their wanderings towards Valinor and did not see the light of the Two Trees.\n\n"}

Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami, where it is also still very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread. Salami is an important ingredient for Cuban sandwiches made in Tampa, where there is a large Italian population, but is not usually included in South Florida.\n\nIn 2012, the \"Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich\" was designated as the \"signature sandwich of the city of Tampa\" by the Tampa City Council.\n\nAs with Cuban bread, the origin of the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a \"Cuban mix,\" a \"\"mixto\",\" a \"Cuban pressed sandwich,\" or a \"Cubano\") is murky. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, travel between Cuba and Florida was easy, especially from Key West and Tampa, and Cubans frequently sailed back and forth for employment, pleasure, and family visits. Because of this constant and largely undocumented movement of people, culture and ideas, it is impossible to say exactly when or where the Cuban sandwich originated.\n\nSome believe that the sandwich was a common lunch food for workers in both the cigar factories and sugar mills of Cuba (especially in big cities such as Havana or Santiago de Cuba) and the cigar factories of Key West by the 1860s. Historian Loy Glenn Westfall states that the sandwich was \"born in Cuba and educated in Key West.\"\n\nThe cigar industry in Florida shifted to Tampa in the mid-1880s, and tens of thousands of Cuban workers moved to the area over the next decade. The first recorded mentions of a distinct Cuban sandwich survive in descriptions of workers' cafés in Ybor City and West Tampa from around 1900, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there. Researcher Andrew Huse states that \"the old 'mixtos' coalesced into something more distinct – the Cuban sandwiches we know and love – an original Tampa creation.\"\n\nA travel article published by the \"Mason City Globe Gazette\" in 1934 said that Tampa's cooking was \"much more distinctive than elsewhere in the state\" and lists Cuban sandwiches (along with Cuban bread) among the city's signature foods. \nBy the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami cafeteria and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after Fidel Castro's 1959 rise to power in their native land. The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them. Cuban sandwiches and variations thereof are now served in various Cuban exile communities in places such as New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, among others.\n\nWhile there is some debate as to the contents of a \"true\" Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8–12 inches (20–30 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then sliced roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, and thinly sliced dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted.\n\nThe main regional disagreement about the sandwich’s recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. In South Florida, salami is left out. A 1934 travel article describes a Tampa Cuban sandwich as a \"complete meal\" consisting of ham, lean pork, Swiss cheese, soft salami, dill pickle and a \"liberal moistening of mustard\" served on \"very crisp and crusty\" Cuban bread. These ingredients are reiterated 27 years later in the first and all subsequent editions of \"The Gasparilla Cookbook\" (1961), a still-popular collection of Tampa cuisine.\n\nMayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato are usually available options throughout Florida menus, but such ingredients are usually frowned upon by traditionalists.\n\nWhen assembled, the sandwich can be toasted in a sandwich press called a \"plancha\", which is similar to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The \"plancha\" both heats and compresses the sandwich, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the cheese is melted. It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving.\n\nA similar sandwich is the medianoche (\"midnight\") sandwich; as the name suggests, the sandwich originated as a late-night snack, likely in the night clubs of Havana. The medianoche contains the same ingredients as the Cuban sandwich, but is smaller and, unlike a Cuban, is served on yellow-colored egg bread (similar to challah), which is softer and sweeter than Cuban bread.\n\n\n\nThis dish and its origin are also mentioned in:\n\n"}

The name is derived from , meaning \"to chop\". Canned corned beef hash became especially popular in countries such as Britain and France during and after the Second World War as rationing limited the availability of fresh meat. A common alternative is roast beef hash.\n\nIn many places, hash is served primarily as a breakfast food, often with eggs and toast, and occasionally with fried potatoes such as hash browns or home fries. In the United States, hash is sometimes served with biscuits.\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that hash was making a comeback as more than just a dish for leftovers or breakfasts of last resort, with high-end restaurants offering sophisticated hash dishes on their menus.\n\nThe meat packing company Hormel claims that it introduced canned corned beef hash and roast beef hash to the U.S. in 1950, but \"hash\" of many forms was part of the American diet since at least the 18th century, as is attested by the availability of numerous recipes and the existence of many \"hash houses\" named after the dish. In the United States, September 27 is \"National Corned Beef Hash Day.\"\n\nAlternatively, in the southern United States, the term \"hash\" may refer to two dishes:\n\nIn Denmark, hash is known in Danish as \"biksemad\" (roughly translated, \"tossed together food\"), and it is a traditional leftover dish usually served with a fried egg, worcestershire sauce, pickled red beet slices and ketchup or Bearnaise sauce. The meat is usually pork, and the mixture is not mashed together into a paste, but rather the ingredients are coarsely diced and readily discernible in their cooked form.\n\nIn Sweden, there is a version of hash called pyttipanna and in Finland, pyttipannu and Norway, pyttipanne. It is similar to the Danish version. The Swedish variety Pytt Bellman calls specifically for beef instead of other meats and adding cream to the hash. It is named after Sweden's 18th century national poet Carl Michael Bellman.\n\nIn Austria and perhaps more specifically Tyrol, there exists a similar dish called \"Gröstl\", usually consisting of chopped leftover meats (often being pork sausage), potato and onions fried with herbs (typically marjoram and parsley) and then served topped with a fried egg.\n\nIn Slovenia it is called <nowiki>\"haše\"</nowiki> and very often used as a spaghetti sauce. It is made out of minced pork and veal meat, potato sauce, onion, garlic, flour and spices.\n\nIn Malaysia, a similar dish is called \"bergedil\". It is usually made with minced meat, potatoes and onions, fried until brown.\n\nIn Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American cuisines, there is a similar dish called picadillo (Spanish) or \"carne moída\" (Portuguese). It is made with ground meat (usually beef), tomatoes (tomato sauce may be used as a substitute), vegetables and spices that vary by region (the Portuguese and Brazilian version is generally \"carne moída refogada\", very heavy on garlic, in the form of an aioli sofrito called refogado, and often also heavy on onion and bell peppers). It is often served with rice (it can be fried in aioli sofrito if those who will eat have a strong fondness for garlic), as well as okra, in the form of \"quiabo refogado\"—okra fried in an aioli sofrito, just as the hash itself and the collard greens used in feijoada—, in Brazil, there constituting a staple) or used as a filling in dishes such as tacos, tostadas, or as a regular breakfast hash with eggs and tortillas (not in Brazil and Portugal). In Brazil and Portugal, it is used as bolognese sauce for pasta, and also used as a filling for pancake rolls, pastel (Brazilian pastry empanada), \"empadão\" and others (not with okra as it is far too perishable to be used in a fill for fast food and its consumption together with wheat flour-based foods often does not fit cultural tastes). The name comes from the West Iberian (Spanish, Leonese and Portuguese) infinitive verb \"picar\", which means \"to mince\" or \"to chop\".\n\nIn Germany, \"Labskaus\" is made with beef or corned beef minced with onions and boiled potatoes and fried in lard. Beetroot and herring may be added, or served as a side dish. Additionally, a sauce consisting of ground meat and served with pasta is called \"Haschee\".\n\n"}

At the time, London costermongers (street traders) were in the habit of wearing trousers decorated at the seams with pearl buttons that had been found by market traders. In the late 1870s, Croft adapted this to create a pearly suit to draw attention to himself and aid his fund-raising activities. In 1911 an organised pearly society was formed in Finchley, north London. \n\nCroft's funeral in January 1930 was attended by 400 followers and received national media coverage. In 1934 a memorial, referring to him as \"The original Pearly King\", was unveiled in St Pancras Cemetery, and in a speech to mark the occasion he was said to have raised £5,000 for those suffering in London's hospitals.\n\nThe pearlies are now divided into several active groups. Croft's founding organisation is called the Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association. It was reformed in 1975 and holds the majority of the original pearly titles which are City of London, Westminster, Victoria, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Shoreditch, Islington, Dalston and Hoxton. Other groups have also been established over the years. The oldest is the Pearly Guild, which began in 1902. Modern additions include the London Pearly Kings and Queens Society, which started in 2001 and the Pearly Kings and Queens Guild.

{"id": "518306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=518306", "title": "Kigo", "text": "Kigo\n\nAlthough the term \"kigo\" was coined as late as 1908, representation of, and reference to, the seasons has long been important in Japanese culture and poetry. The earliest anthology of Japanese poetry, the mid-8th century \"Man'yōshū\", contained several sections devoted to the seasons. By the time of the first imperial Japanese anthology, the \"Kokinshū\" a century and a half later (AD 905), the seasonal sections had become a much larger part of the anthology. Both of these anthologies had sections for other categories such as love poems and miscellaneous (\"zō\") poems.\n\nThe writing of the linked-verse form renga dates to the middle of the Heian period (roughly AD 1000) and developed through the medieval era. By the 13th century there were very set rules for the writing of renga, and its formal structure specified that about half of the stanzas should include a reference to a specific season, depending upon their place in the poem. According to these rules, the \"hokku\" (the opening stanza of the renga) must include a reference to the season in which the renga was written.\n\nA lighter form of renga called \"haikai no renga\" (\"playful\" linked verse) was introduced near the end of the 15th century. \"Haikai\" was the linked verse practice followed and elevated by Matsuo Bashō and others until the Meiji period (1867–1912). Near the end of the 19th century, the hokku was completely separated from the context of \"haikai no renga\" by Masaoka Shiki and revised and written as an independent verse form which he named \"haiku\", though retaining the kigo. In the Taishō period (1912–1925) a movement began to drop the kigo entirely. Today most Japanese haiku include a kigo, though many haiku written in languages other than Japanese omit it (see for example Haiku in English).\n\nThe association of kigo with a particular season may be obvious, though sometimes it is more subtle. Pumpkins (\"kabocha\") are a winter squash associated with the autumn harvest.\n\nIt may be less obvious why the \"moon\" (\"tsuki\") is an autumn kigo, since it is visible year round. In autumn the days become shorter and the nights longer, yet they are still warm enough to stay outside, so one is more likely to notice the moon. Often, the night sky will be free of clouds in autumn, with the moon visible. The full moon can help farmers work after the sun goes down to harvest their crops (a \"harvest moon\").\n\nIn the Japanese calendar, seasons traditionally followed the lunisolar calendar with the solstices and equinoxes at the middle of a season. The traditional Japanese seasons are:\n\nIn categorizing kigo, each season is divided into early, middle, and late periods, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese haiku poets often use a book called a \"saijiki\", which lists \"kigo\" with example poems. An entry in a \"saijiki\" usually includes a description of the kigo itself, together with a list of similar or related words, and some examples of haiku that include that kigo. The \"saijiki\" are divided into the four seasons (and modern saijiki usually include a section for the \"New Year\" and another for seasonless (\"muki\") words). Those sections are divided into a standard set of categories, and then the kigo are sorted within their proper category. The most common categories (with some examples of Japanese summer kigo) are:\n\nSummer\n\n\nAlthough haiku are often thought of as poems about nature, two of the seven categories are primarily about human activities (Humanity and Observances).\n\nJapan is long from north to south, so the seasonal features vary from place to place. The sense of season in kigo is based on the region of Kyoto. Primarily because the classical literature of Japan developed mainly in this area. Specifically writings prior to, and including, the first part of the Edo period (the early 17th century).\n\n[Note: An asterisk (*) after the Japanese name for the kigo denotes an external link to a saijiki entry for that specific kigo which includes a sample haiku from the Japanese haiku: a topical dictionary website.]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis group of kigo is a modern invention. Before Japan began using the Gregorian calendar in 1873, the Japanese New Year was at the beginning of spring.\n\n\nSwitching from the old Japanese calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1873 brought about numerous changes in life in Japan. Even traditional events have been affected by this change. One typical example is the case of Tanabata. Traditionally the date of Tanabata is seventh day of the seventh month of the Japanese calendar. The exact equivalent in the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year, but it is usually in August. Today in many places it is celebrated on 7 July; hence there is a dispute as to how Tanabata should be treated as a kigo.\n\nSince kigo are affiliated with seasonal events, several modern haiku poets have had to reconsider the construction of kigo and their attribution to the seasons. One of the biggest changes to the local tradition is the creation of the lunar New Year as a seasonal section for kigo.\n\nHaiku started as a form of Japanese poetry and is now written in many different languages around the world. William J. Higginson's \"Haiku World\" (1996), which is the first international \"saijiki\", contains more than 1,000 poems, by over 600 poets from 50 countries writing in 25 languages. The writing of haiku around the world has increased with the advent of the internet, where one can even find examples of haiku written in Latin, Esperanto, and Klingon, as well as numerous examples in more common languages.\n\nInternational haiku poets have adapted the idea of kigo to their local conditions and culture. Many phenomena that might be used as kigo are similar throughout much of the world, such as the blooming of flowers and trees in the spring, and the migration of birds in the spring and autumn. Even if the trees and birds are not the same as in Japan, the concepts are still the same.\n\nOn the other hand, climatic conditions can often be very different from what the Japanese are used to. The tropics, for example, are very different from the temperate climate of Japan and usually only have a wet or Monsoon season, and a dry season. Tornado Alley area of the United States has its tornado season (peaking from late winter through mid summer, depending upon latitude). Areas with a Mediterranean climate, such as Western Australia, coastal California, and Spain have their summer Fire Season. On the other hand, in the Caribbean and the east coast of North America and surrounding areas, it is Hurricane Season during the summer and autumn months.\n\nThere are many local cultures around the world, with similarities and differences. One similarity is that many areas have harvest festivals with bonfires. One difference between locations is that migrating birds will be present in different locations at different times of year.\nHere are some examples of kigo from southern California:\n\n\nIn the famous haiku by Matsuo Bashō below, is a \"kigo\" for spring. Haiku had been traditionally written about the singing of mating frogs, but Bashō chose to focus on a very different sound.\nHaiku without kigo is possible, and are described as \"Muki\" 無季 (no-season).\n\nIn the pre-Meiji era (before 1868), almost all haiku contained a kigo. For example, Japanese experts have classified only about 10 of Matsuo Bashō's (1644-1694) hokku in the miscellaneous (zō) category (out of about 1,000 hokku). As with most of the pre-Meiji poets, Bashō was primarily a renku poet (that is, he composed linked verse with other poets), so he also wrote plenty of miscellaneous and love stanzas for the interior lines of a renku. Usually about half the stanzas in a renku do not reference a season.\n\nThe Meiji era poet Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902), who recommended several major reforms to the writing of hokku and tanka, including an expansion in subject matter and vocabulary, still included kigo in his revision of hokku, which he renamed haiku. Experts have classified a few hundred of Shiki's haiku in the miscellaneous category (out of the few thousand that he wrote). His follower Takahama Kyoshi, who was the most influential haiku poet in the generation after Shiki, also emphasized kigo. In the early part of the 20th century, there were a number of Japanese poets, such as Kawahigashi Hekigoto, Ogiwara Seisensui, Noguchi Yonejiro, Taneda Santōka, Ozaki Hōsai, Nakatsuka Ippekirō, and Ban'ya Natsuishi who were less concerned about some traditions of haiku such as the inclusion of kigo. Some, like Hekigoto and Seisensui, actively opposed the insistence on kigo, but even they often included kigo in their haiku.\nMost Japanese and many western haiku written today still follow tradition by including a kigo. Many haiku groups and editors of haiku publications insist that haiku include a kigo. For some haiku traditionalists, anything that does not have a kigo is something else, either \"senryū\" (comic haikai) or \"zappai\" (miscellaneous haikai). Until a few modern saijiki added the miscellaneous category, no seasonless haiku would have been included as examples in saijiki, which are the major references for haiku poets in Japan.\n\nThere are some reformers who have made suggestions such as using the idea of \"keywords\" (which would include kigo as a subset). Keywords are words such as dawn, birthday cake, ocean wave, beggar or dog, with strong associations, but which are not necessarily associated with a particular season. Birds that do not migrate, such as pigeons or sparrows, are additional examples of non-seasonal keywords.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are sometimes called wh-words, because in English most of them start with \"wh-\" (compare Five Ws). They may be used in both direct questions (\"Where is he going?\") and in indirect questions (\"I wonder where he is going\"). In English and various other languages the same forms are also used as relative pronouns in certain relative clauses (\"The country where he was born\") and certain adverb clauses (\"I go where he goes\").\n\nA particular type of interrogative word is the interrogative particle, which serves to convert a statement into a yes–no question, without having any other meaning. Examples include \"est-ce que\" in French, ли \"li\" in Russian, \"czy\" in Polish, \"ĉu\" in Esperanto, কি \"ki\" in Bengali, \"ma\" in Chinese, '/' in Turkish, \"pa\" in Ladin, \"ka\" in Japanese and \"ko/kö\" in Finnish. (The English word \"whether\" has a similar function but only in indirect questions; and Multicultural London English may use \"innit\", even in the absence of the pronoun \"it\".) Such particles contrast with other interrogative words, which form what are called \"wh\"-questions rather than yes–no questions.\n\nFor more information about the grammatical rules for forming questions in various languages, see Interrogative.\n\nInterrogative words in English include:\n\nCertain pronominal adverbs may also be used as interrogative words, such as \"whereby\" or \"wherefore\".\n\n\"For a complete list, see Category:English interrogative pro-forms on Wiktionary.\"\n\nYes-no questions can begin with an interrogative particle, such as:\n\nEnglish questions can also be formed without an interrogative word, by changing the intonation or punctuation of a statement. For example: \"You're done eating?\"\n\nUltimately, the English interrogative pronouns (those beginning with \"wh\" in addition to the word \"how\"), derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \"ko-\" or \"ki\", the former of which was reflected in Proto-Germanic as \"χa-\" or \"kha-\", due to Grimm's law.\n\nThese underwent further sound changes and spelling changes, notably \"wh\"-cluster reductions, resulting in the initial sound being either /w/ (in most dialects) or /h/ (\"how, who\") and the initial spelling being either \"wh\" or \"h\" (\"how\"). This was the result of two sound changes – /hw/ > /h/ before /uː/ (\"how, who\") and /hw/ > /w/ otherwise – and the spelling change from \"hw\" to \"wh\" in Middle English. The unusual pronunciation versus spelling of \"who\" is because the vowel was formerly /aː/, and thus it did not undergo the sound change in Old English, but in Middle English (following spelling change) the vowel changed to /uː/ and it followed the same sound change as \"how\" before it, but with the Middle English spelling unchanged.\n\nIn \"how\" (Old English \"hū\", from Proto-Germanic \"χō\"), the \"w\" merged into the lave of the word, as it did in Old Frisian \"hū, hō\" (Dutch \"hoe\" \"how\"), but it can still be seen in Old Saxon \"hwō\", Old High German \"hwuo\" (German \"wie\" \"how\"). In English, the gradual change of voiceless stops into voiceless fricatives (phase 1 of Grimm's law) during the development of Germanic languages is responsible for \"wh-\" of interrogatives. Although some varieties of American English and various Scottish dialects still preserve the original sound (i.e. [ʍ] rather than [w]), most have only the [w].\n\nThe words \"who\", \"whom\", \"whose\", \"what\" and \"why\", can all be considered to come from a single Old English word \"hwā\", reflecting its masculine and feminine nominative (\"hwā\"), dative (\"hwām\"), genitive (\"hwæs\"), neuter nominative and accusative (\"hwæt\"), and instrumental (masculine and neuter singular) (\"hwȳ\", later \"hwī\") respectively. Other interrogative words, such as \"which\", \"how\", \"where\", \"whence\", or \"whither\", derive either from compounds (\"which\" coming from a compound of \"hwā\" [what, who] and \"līc\" [like]), or other words from the same root (\"how\" deriving from \"hū\").\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European root also directly originated the Latin and Romance form \"qu-\" in words such as Latin \"quī\" (\"which\") and \"quando\" (\"when\"); it has also undergone sound and spelling changes, as in French \"qui\" \"which\", with initial /k/, and Spanish \"cuando,\" with initial /kw/.\n\nMost English interrogative words can take the suffix \"-ever\", to form words such as \"whatever\" and \"wherever\". (Older forms of the suffix are \"-so\" and \"-soever\", as in \"whoso\" and \"whomsoever\".) These words have the following main meanings:\n\nSome of these words have also developed independent meanings, such as \"however\" as an adverb meaning \"nonetheless\"; \"whatsoever\" as an emphatic adverb used with \"no\", \"none\", \"any\", \"nothing\", etc. (\"I did nothing wrong whatsoever\"); and \"whatever\" in its slang usage.\n\nA frequent class of interrogative words in several other languages is the interrogative verb:\n\n\n"}

In contemporary times, chateaubriand cuts of beef refer to \"a large steak cut from the thickest part of a fillet of beef\".\n\nIn the gastronomy of the 19th century, the steak for chateaubriand was cut from the sirloin, and the dish was served with a reduced sauce named chateaubriand sauce (or a similar sauce) that is prepared with white wine and shallots moistened with demi-glace, and mixed with butter, tarragon, and lemon juice. It was also traditionally served with mushrooms.\n\nThe \"Larousse Gastronomique\" indicates that the dish \"chateaubriand\" was created by the namesake's personal chef, Montmireil, for the Vicomte François-René de Chateaubriand, at that time (1822) Ambassador of France in England. An alternative spelling of the Vicomte's surname is \"Châteaubriant\", which term, the \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie des Gastronomes\" indicates, identifies the source and the quality of the beef-cattle bred at the town of Châteaubriant, in the Loire-Atlantique, France..\n(Montmireil also created in London a pudding called \"Diplomate\").\n\nChateaubriand sauce is a culinary sauce that is typically served with red meat. It is also sometimes referred to as \"crapaudine sauce\". It is prepared in a series of reductions, and typically accompanies chateaubriand steak. Other dishes, such as \"tournedos villaret\" and \"villemer tournedos\", also incorporate the sauce in their preparation.\n\nThe origin of chateaubriand sauce is subject to debate. Some credit its creation to a chef named Montmireil, who prepared it for François-René de Chateaubriand. Others speculate that it originated at the Champeaux restaurant following the publication of de Chateaubriand's book, \"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem\" (Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem).\n\nThe sauce is prepared with shallots, mushroom, thyme, bay leaf, tarragon, white wine, brown veal stock and beurre maître d'hôtel (sweet butter infused with parsley). Additional ingredients may include meat glaze, demi-glace, pan drippings, onion, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, peppercorn and salt. The preparation involves cooking all of the ingredients together except for the brown veal stock and beurre maître d'hôtel, until it is reduced by two-thirds of the original content. After this, the veal stock is added in proportions equal to the amount of wine that was originally used before the reduction, and this mixture is then reduced to half its size. The final step is for the mixture to be strained and then topped with chopped tarragon and beurre maître d'hôtel.\n\nA common dish is chateaubriand steak prepared with the sauce and served with potatoes.\n\nA dish that incorporates chateaubriand sauce is \"tournedos villaret\", in which mushroom caps are filled with the sauce and placed atop tournedos, all of which are placed atop tartlets filled with kidney bean purée. The sauce is sometimes served in a separate side dish, rather than atop meats, such as with the dish \"villemer tournedos\", which is prepared with fried tournedos placed atop fried chicken croquettes, along with tongue, mushroom and truffle.\n\n\n"}

It originated in France but has spread to other countries over the years.\n\nThe tarte Tatin was created accidentally at the Hotel Tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, France, about 100 miles (160 km) south of Paris, in the 1880s. The hotel was run by two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline Tatin. There are conflicting stories concerning the tart's origin, but the most common is that Stéphanie Tatin, who did most of the cooking, was overworked one day. She started to make a traditional apple pie but left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. Smelling the burning, she tried to rescue the dish by putting the pastry base on top of the pan of apples, quickly finishing the cooking by putting the whole pan in the oven. After turning out the upside down tart, she was surprised to find how much the hotel guests appreciated the dessert. In an alternative version of the tart's origin, Stéphanie baked a caramelized apple tart upside-down by mistake, regardless she served her guests the unusual dish. Whatever the veracity of either story, the concept of the upside down tart was not a new one. For instance, patissier Antonin Carême already mentions glazed \"gâteaux renversés\" adorned with apples from Rouen or other fruit in his \"Pâtissier Royal Parisien\" (1841).\n\nThe tarte became a signature dish of the Hôtel Tatin. Historians and gourmets have argued, whether it is a genuine creation of the Demoiselles (sisters) Tatin, or the branding of an improved version of the \"tarte solognote\", a traditional dish named after the Sologne region which surrounds Lamotte-Beuvron. Research suggests that, while the tarte became a specialty of the Hôtel Tatin, the sisters did not set out to create a \"signature dish\"; they never wrote a cookbook or published their recipe; they never even called it \"tarte Tatin\". That recognition was bestowed upon them by Curnonsky, famous French author and epicure, as well as the Parisian restaurant Maxim's after the sisters' deaths.\n\nOne of the legends has it that Louis Vaudable, the owner of Maxim's, once tasted it and was smitten. As he described it:\n\n\"I used to hunt around Lamotte-Beuvron in my youth and had discovered, in a very small hotel run by elderly ladies, a marvelous dessert listed on the menu under tarte solognote; I questioned the kitchen staff about its recipe, but was sternly rebuffed. Undaunted, I got myself hired as a gardener, but three days later, I was fired when it became clear that I could hardly plant a cabbage; however this was long enough to pierce the secrets of the kitchen; I brought the recipe back and put it on my own menu under 'tarte des demoiselles Tatin'.\"\n\nIn reality, Vaudable was born in 1902; the sisters retired in 1906 and died in 1911 and 1917; whereas Maxim's was purchased by the Vaudable family in 1932.\n\nOriginally, the tarte Tatin was made with two regional apple varieties: Reine des Reinettes (Queen of the Pippins), and Calville. Over the years, other varieties have tended to displace them, including Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala. When choosing apples for a tarte Tatin, it is important to pick some that will hold their shape while cooking, and not melt into apple sauce. In North America, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, or Jonathan are excellent choices .\n\nTarte Tatin can also be made with pears, quinces, peaches, pineapple, tomatoes, other fruit, or vegetables, such as onion.\n\nThe Tarte Tatin should be made with puff or shortcrust pastry.\n\nVariations of this recipe can also be made as turnovers, where the pastry is not only cooked upside-down, but also inverted.\n\n"}

In practice a chef's signature dish often changes with time or they may claim several signature dishes.\n\nIn a weaker sense, a signature dish may become associated with an individual restaurant, particularly if the chef who created it is no longer with the establishment.

Local produce, restaurant décor, and even the type of building you choose can all contribute to a larger yield by taking on local sensibilities. Emphasizing (an establishment's) connection to its location provides great marketing possibilities.\n\nAt its weakest, the term can simply mean \"chef's specials\" which are in no way unique or even particularly unusual.\n\n\n"}

The typical fillings consist of maltose (condensed malt sugar), and they are usually sold in special gift boxes as souvenirs for visitors. Some famous suncake pastry shops always have long lines of people waiting to buy boxed suncakes.\n\nThe shape of suncakes is round, and they may vary in size. They are characterized by flaky crusts. Most people eat them with Chinese tea, and some people dissolve them in hot water to make a porridge-like dessert.\n\nThe first suncakes were made by the Lin family in the She-Ko area of Shengang Township, Taichung County (now part of Taichung City). The Lin family used condensed malt sugar as a filling for cake pastries. Later on, pastry maker Wei Qing-hai modified the cakes to their current form.\n\nThough not originally called \"suncakes\", they were given the name by the owner of \"Sun Booth\", one of the most famous pastry shops that sells them. The name was not trademarked, and other pastry shops have used the same name for their own suncakes.\n\n\n"}

Although soba means buckwheat, yakisoba noodles are actually made from wheat flour, and are typically flavored with a condiment similar to oyster sauce. The dish first appeared in food stalls in Japan during the early 20th century.\n\nYakisoba is prepared by frying ramen-style wheat noodles (also called \"Chinese noodles\" 中華麺) with bite-sized pork and finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, onions, bean sprouts and carrots. Then flavored with yakisoba sauce, salt and pepper. It can be served with a variety of garnishes, such as \"aonori\" (seaweed powder), \"beni shōga\" (shredded pickled ginger), \"katsuobushi\" (fish flakes), and mayonnaise.\n\n\"Yakisoba\" is most familiarly served on a plate either as a main dish or a side dish. Another popular way to prepare and serve yakisoba in Japan is to pile the noodles into a bun sliced down the middle in the style of a hot dog, and garnish the top with mayonnaise and shreds of pickled ginger. Called yakisoba-pan (\"pan\" meaning \"bread\") it is commonly available at \"konbini\" (convenience stores).\n\nSometimes, Japanese \"udon\" is used as a replacement of Chinese style \"soba\" and called \"yakiudon\". This variation was started in Kitakyushu or Kokura in Fukuoka Prefecture.\n\nIn Okinawa, yakisoba is popular with Okinawans and U.S. service members stationed on the island alike. After the 1945 hostilities ended on Okinawa, the US military command supplied American food products to the malnourished residents. Yakisoba was prepared from spaghetti, spam, ketchup, any available vegetable (usually canned), and mayonnaise. Mess halls and other on-base eateries often serve yakisoba. Chopped hotdogs are a popular addition to yakisoba made on Okinawa, in addition to other meats such as ham, chicken, and pork.\n\n"}

They can be bought pre-sliced in vacuum packs at a supermarket or grocery store, or they can be purchased at a delicatessen or deli counter, where they might be sliced to order. Unsliced, canned lunch meats are sold under brands such as Spam and Treet.\n\nMost pre-sliced lunch meats are higher in fat, nitrates, and sodium than those that are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface requires stronger preservatives. As a result, processed meats significantly contribute to incidence of heart disease and diabetes, even more so than red meat.\n\nA prospective study following 448,568 people across Europe showed a positive association between processed meat consumption and mortality, due to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Similarly, a prospective study in United States following half a million people concluded a similar association with death and increased processed meat consumption. The World Cancer Research Fund International guidelines on cancer prevention recommend avoiding all processed meats.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that those over 50 reheat lunch meats to \"steaming hot\" and use them within four days.\n\nIn Commonwealth countries, luncheon meat specifically refers to products that can include mechanically reclaimed meat and offal. In these countries, the terms \"cold meats\", \"cooked meats\", \"deli meats\", or \"sliced meats\" are used, instead.\n\nIn Guatemala, a lunch meat is a traditional dish eaten in November. It is eaten the first and second day of the month to celebrate \"El día de Todos los Santos\" (All Saints' Day) and \"El día de Todos los Difuntos\" (All Souls' Day). The two types are red and white.\n\nThe product got more popular after investigation what it contains. E.g. LUNCHEON MEAT TULIP (made in Denmark) is not made of 70% of meat as expected (base on country standard), but contains 18% of pork meat, 39% of chicken mechanically separated meat, 18% of pork mechanically separated meat.\n\n"}

Every year it is sung at the Bursar's Dinner in March and the college's Gaudy in November. But it is also sung once a century, in a special ceremony.\n\nIn the ceremony, Fellows parade around the College with flaming torches, led by a \"Lord Mallard\" who is carried in a chair, in search of a giant mallard that supposedly flew out of the foundations of the college when it was being built in 1437. The procession is led by an individual carrying a duck — originally dead, now just wooden — tied to the end of a vertical pole. The ceremony was last held in 2001, with Martin Litchfield West acting as Lord Mallard. His predecessor as Lord Mallard was Cosmo Lang, who presided over the centenary ceremony in 1901.\n\nThe words of the song are as follows:\n\nThe word \"swapping\", repeatedly used in the chorus, is a now-obsolete use from Middle English meaning \"striking\" (as in \"what a remarkably big duck that is!\").\n\nThe identity of King Edward in the song is not known; it could refer to any of the five English monarchs of that name (three numbered, and two earlier monarchs) up to the time the song was created.\n\nThe reference to \"Jove turn'd a Swan\" refers to the mythical incident in which the Roman god Jupiter transformed himself into a swan to seduce Queen Leda.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Victorians disapproved of the reference to the mallard's \"swapping tool of generation\", mightier than any other in \"ye wingged Nation\" (of birds). They dropped this verse from the song, but to the delight of traditionalists, it was restored in the 2001 ceremony. (And apparently this honour does indeed belong to a duck, though not a mallard. )\n\nThe last two lines are an invitation to the singers to retire to a convenient watering-hole. They could be paraphrased as saying \"in much the same way as the Mallard dives into a pond, let us dive into a drinking bowl.\"\n\nA folksong (Roud 1517) found in southern England is an accumulative song about the body of the mallard.\n"}

It is popular in the United States, where it is a staple in many Italian restaurants.\n\nWedding soup consists of green vegetables (usually endive and escarole or cabbage, lettuce, kale, and/or spinach) and meat (usually meatballs and/or sausage, the latter sometimes made of chicken and containing Italian parsley and parmesan cheese) in a clear chicken-based broth. Wedding soup sometimes contains pasta (usually cavatelli, fusilli, acini di pepe, pastina, orzo, etc.), lentils, carrots, or grated parmesan cheese.\n\nThe term \"wedding soup\" comes from the Italian language phrase \"\"minestra maritata\"\" (\"married soup\"), which is a reference to the flavor produced by the combination/\"marriage\" of greens and the meat. The \"minestra maritata\" recipe is also prepared by the families of Lazio and Campania. Some form of \"minestra maritata\" was long popular in Toledo, Spain, before pasta became an affordable commodity to most Spaniards. The modern wedding soup is quite a bit lighter than the old Spanish form, which contained more meats than just the meatballs of modern Italian-American versions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "533017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533017", "title": "Horror vacui", "text": "Horror vacui\n\nIn visual art, horror vacui (; from Latin \"fear of empty space\"), also kenophobia (from Greek \"fear of the empty\"), is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an artwork with detail. In physics,\"horror vacui\" reflects Aristotle's idea that \"nature abhors an empty space.\"\n\nItalian art critic and scholar Mario Praz used the to describe the excessive use of ornament in design during the Victorian age. Other examples of horror vacui can be seen in the densely decorated carpet pages of Insular illuminated manuscripts, where intricate patterns and interwoven symbols may have served \"\"apotropaic\" as well as decorative functions.\" The interest in meticulously filling empty spaces is also reflected in Arabesque decoration in Islamic art from ancient times to present. Art historian Ernst Gombrich theorized that such highly ornamented patterns can function like a picture frame for sacred images and spaces. \"The richer the elements of the frame,\" Gombrich wrote,\"the more the centre will gain in dignity.\" \n\nAnother example comes from ancient Greece during the Geometric Age (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver Jean Duvet consistently exhibits horror vacui.\n\nHorror vacui is apparent in some styles of postmodern graphic design, including the work of artists like David Carson or Vaughan Oliver, and in the underground comix movement in the work of S. Clay Wilson, Robert Crumb, Robert Williams, and later comic artists such as Mark Beyer. The paintings of Williams, Faris Badwan, Emerson Barrett, Joe Coleman and Todd Schorr are further examples of horror vacui in the modern Lowbrow art movement. \n\nThe entheogen-inspired visionary art of certain indigenous peoples, such as the Huichol yarn paintings and the ayahuasca-inspired art of Pablo Amaringo, often exhibits this style, as does the psychedelic art movement of the 1960s counterculture. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric molas of Kuna people and the traditional clothing on Shipibo-Conibo people.\n\nThe artwork in the Where's Wally? series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of Edward Gorey.\n\nThe Tingatinga painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique (Malangatana Ngwenya) also fill the canvas in this way.\n\nThe arrangement of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs were repeated or phonetic complements added to prevent gaps.\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between \"horror vacui\" and value perception, and commercial designers favor visual clarity in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences. \n\nThe term is also used as an analogy to the Aristotelian idea that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected. This was widely believed up to the time of Rene Descartes.\n\n"}
{"id": "533482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533482", "title": "Cheesecake", "text": "Cheesecake\n\nCheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. It may be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated). \n\nCheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in many different ways. It may be flavored by adding vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors to the cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished pie with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other toppings. \n\nAn ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece. The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes (—\"plakountopoiikon sungramma\"). The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato the Elder's \"De Agri Cultura\", which includes recipes for three cakes for religious uses: \"libum\", \"savillum\" and \"placenta\". Of the three, placenta is most like most modern cheesecakes, having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.\n\nA more modern version is found in \"Forme of Cury\", an English cookbook from 1390. On this basis, chef Heston Blumenthal has argued that cheesecake is an English invention. \n\nThe English name \"cheesecake\" has been used only since the 15th century, but the cheesecake did not evolve into its modern form until somewhere around the 18th century. Europeans began removing yeast and adding beaten eggs to the cheesecake instead. With the overpowering yeast flavor gone, the result tasted more like a dessert treat.\n\nModern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel, accidentally came up with a way of making an \"unripened cheese\" that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.\n\nModern cheesecake comes in two different types. Along with the baked cheesecake, some cheesecakes are made with uncooked cream-cheese on a crumbled-biscuit base. This type of cheesecake was invented in the United States.\n\nIronically, modern cheesecake is not usually classified as a cake, despite the name. People who classify it as a torte point to the presence of many eggs, which are the sole source of leavening, as a key factor. For others, the overall structure, with the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour, is compelling evidence that it is a custard pie. Other sources identify it as a flan or tart.\n\nCheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: baked and unbaked. Each comes in a variety of styles determined by region:\n\n\nAsian-style cheesecake flavors include matcha (powdered Japanese green tea), lychee, and mango. Asian-style cheesecakes are also lighter in flavor and are sometimes light and spongy in texture. Compared to its counterparts, Asian cheesecake is also considerably less sweet.\n\n\nAustralian cheesecakes are more commonly unbaked. Common flavors include passionfruit, chocolate, raspberry, lemon, caramel, and vanilla.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake was baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it. These cheesecakes are typically baked before serving.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "534382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534382", "title": "Honda Civic Hybrid", "text": "Honda Civic Hybrid\n\nThe Honda Civic Hybrid is a variation of the Honda Civic with a hybrid electric powertrain. Honda introduced the Civic Hybrid in Japan in December 2001 and discontinued it in 2015. In the United States, it was the first hybrid automobile to be certified as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero-Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) from the California Air Resources Board (CARB).\n\nThe Civic Hybrid uses an Integrated Motor Assist hybrid system similar to that of the Honda Insight. The Civic Hybrid was only marketed in sedan configurations.\n\nThe Civic hybrid, based on the seventh generation Civic, was first introduced to the Japanese market in December 2001. Honda claimed it was the most fuel efficient 5-passenger gasoline-powered production vehicle in the world at the time. It was introduced to the U.S. in spring 2002 as a 2003 model. It is the first hybrid vehicle to be certified as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero- Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) from CARB.\n\nThe first generation of the Honda Civic Hybrid was based on the seventh generation Honda Civic. It was the first mainstream vehicle from Honda equipped with a gasoline-electric hybrid system and became the second hybrid model of the company after Insight. Model with manual transmission was rated city / highway according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel mileage estimates, about the same combined mileage as for the Toyota Prius, and became the most fuel-efficient five-passenger sedan ever sold in North America at the time.\n\nThe following is a list of its technical features:\n\nAn electric motor is sandwiched between the gasoline engine and the transmission, providing up to 13 horsepower. The motor also acts as a generator, to recharge the car's nickel-metal hydride battery located between the rear seat and the trunk, and as a starter motor.\n\nThe motor in Civic hybrid is about a quarter-inch () thicker than that of the Insight. Through improvements to the magnetic coils of the DC brushless motor, it achieves 30 percent greater assisting and regenerative torque than the previous model without increasing the size.\n\nIt generates more torque (46 versus 36 pound-feet) than the motor in Insight. The electricity is stored in a battery consisting of 120 1.2-volt Ni-MH D-cells wired in series. The battery can charge and discharge more rapidly and efficiently though the total capacity is reduced from the Insight's (6.0 versus 6.5 AH). Efficiency of the battery modules is increased, through a reduction in energy losses. The battery is housed with the electrical controller in a package called the Intelligent Power Unit (IPU). The new packaging reduces the size of the system by 50 percent and allows the IMA equipment be placed behind the rear seat in the trunk. The unit weighs only and is one-third smaller than that of the Insight.\n\nThe two spark plugs in each cylinder can fire either sequentially or simultaneously, enabling more efficient burning during lean-burn mode and more often lean-burn operation.\nThe engine can operate at a lean 22:1 air-to-fuel ratio more than 60 percent of the time on a flat road.\nThe VTEC cylinder idling system of the engine closes the valves in three of the four cylinders when the car is decelerating, reduces the power lost to the engine by 50 percent, and allows the IMA to extract more electrical energy during braking. The rocker arms operating the intake and exhaust valves have two modes: valve-lift mode or idle mode. They are engaged via a synchronizing piston. During deceleration, the synchro piston disengages the lift-mode rocker arm so that the valves remain at rest, effectively sealing off the cylinder.\n\nAn idle stop feature shuts off the engine automatically when stopped, then restarts immediately when the driver removes their foot from the brake. This auto idle stop system contributes to both greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.\nDuring stop and go driving, the engine will turn off when the car comes to a stop for the first time, however, if the car does not go above and stops again, the engine will not turn off unless the car is stopped for more than 15 seconds.\n\nWith assistance from the electric motor, the combined torque at below 3,700 rpm is greater than that available from the non-hybrid Civic's 1.7-liter engine.\n\nFuel efficiency is further improved by six percent by utilizing: a new front air dam and rear spoiler, along with revised underbody panels, reducing the drag coefficient from 0.30 to 0.28; replacing traditional power steering with electrical power result as reduction in parasitic losses and special lower rolling resistance tires. The Dunlop tires improve ride quality and reduce road noise compared with other hybrids like Insight and Prius. When compared with Insight, a wider tire improves stability at highway speed.\nCar and Driver reported that the car can accelerate in 10.9 seconds.\n\nThe Civic hybrid is estimated to be 40 percent more fuel efficient than its non-hybrid counterpart.\n\nThere was a minor refresh of the design between the 2003 and 2004 model years which affected the front and rear bumper covers, hood and head lights. On the interior, a small center console replaced the driver's arm rest and the rear seats got adjustable head rests. \n\nThe second generation Civic Hybrid is based on the eighth generation Civic. As with other Civics, there are some styling differences to the exterior between the North American and the Japanese market models.\n\nThe powertrain of the second generation Civic hybrid is similar to that of the first generation.\n\nThe following is a list of major changes:\n\nBy using high-performance magnets and high-density windings, Honda is able to increase the power output of the electric motor by 50% to at 2,000 rpm when compared with the first generation. The inverter that controls motor speed is integrated with the motor's ECU for more precise control, resulting in greater efficiency and fuel economy. The output of battery is increased by around 30 percent to 158.4 V. The battery storage box is designed for better cooling performance and vibration resistance to enhance long-term reliability. The higher output of electric motor enables the car to run on electricity only, at a steady when cruising on a flat surface.\nAn internal electric motor is added to the air-conditioner, so it can be powered by either the engine, an electric motor, or both. At a stop, the compressor powered by the battery keeps the cabin cool. An additional compressor that is powered by the petrol engine also engages if rapid cooling is required. When the interior temperature is stable, air conditioning is provided by the battery solely. As soon as the brake pedal is lifted, the petrol engine comes back to life again.\n\nThe new three stage i-VTEC valvetrain has low-rpm, high-rpm and cylinder idle mode. High output valve timing helps the engine to increase its output by 9 percent. During deceleration, the engine is kept idle. There is no combustion in all four cylinders and the cylinders are sealed shut, reducing pumping losses by engine. As a result, recovery of energy wasted during braking is improved by 10 percent.\n\nA digital display is incorporated in the instrument dash showing how much electricity is sent to the battery or how much is used. When the car is braked moderately, maximum number of green LEDs light up showing energy recaptured. When the car is braked harder, the conventional brakes are activated.\n\n\"Car and Driver\" found the car, when compared with previous generation, faster, offered greater refinement, quieter at highway speed, has a stiffer body and a revised suspension that handles bumps better and quietly.\n\nIt is estimated that, when compared to a gasoline engine only Civic sedan of 2006 with an automatic transmission, the Civic hybrid provides an increase of fuel economy in city driving of about 63 percent and an increase of fuel economy in highway driving of about 27 percent. The CVT transmission is designed to achieve the highest efficiency for a given RPM.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed in 2012 alleged that Honda falsely advertised the fuel economy of the Civic Hybrid and that owners were getting significantly lower mileage. The Los Angeles Times reported in May 2012 that at least 36 small-claims lawsuits had also been filed against Honda over alleged false advertisement of gas mileage.\n\nSome users reported that the fuel economy of the Civic Hybrid was reduced after Honda installed a software update to prolong the life of the hybrid battery by reducing the electric motor's output and putting more reliance on the gasoline engine.\n\nA \"Consumer Reports\" survey found a very high rate of battery failure in Civic Hybrids 2nd-generation Civic Hybrids, describing the failure rate for 2009-2010 models as \"shocking\", with over 30% of responders reporting they had needed a battery replacement within the last 12 months. Honda acknowledged problems with the 2006-2008 models which could cause the batteries to \"deteriorate and eventually fail\"; software updates were issued to prolong the life of the battery, but some owners reported these updates led to reduced fuel economy and power. The 132 NiMH cell pack suffers from imbalance as individual cells can't be monitored or charged. Monitoring is available at a 12 cell sub-pack level, but charging isn't. After years/miles of use, the cells become imbalanced as the cells charge/discharge at slightly different rates from one another. Eventually, strong cells are limiting the upper capacity of the pack and weak cells are limiting the lower capacity of the pack thereby reducing the usable capacity of the pack. There are higher capacity non-OEM packs available for less than the OEM price, and many owners have achieved years-long extensions of usable battery life by utilizing a grid charger. A grid charger is a home-made or purchased charger that connects your car to the power-grid. These devices impart a long, slow \"balancing\" charge where all cells are gently charged to their maximum capacity. This can temporarily restore balance and dramatically improve usable capacity for months at a time.\n\nIn March 2015, Honda sent 2009-2011 owners a letter indicating that all versions, not just the PHEV states, would get the 10 year/150,000 mi warranty on the IMA battery. Reference Service Bulletin #15-006.\n\nThe Civic hybrid ranks as the second best selling electric hybrid car in the U.S.\n\n\"Consumer Reports\" ran an article in April 2006 stating that hybrid vehicles would not pay for themselves over 5 years of ownership. However, there was an error in the calculation of depreciation for the hybrid vehicles. It resulted in overstating how much extra money the hybrids would cost their owners during the first five years of ownership. When corrected, the Honda Civic Hybrid did have a payback period of slightly less than 5 years.\nIn October 2010 Vincentric performed a hybrid cost of ownership analysis for the USA market. In this analysis it compared hybrids' 5-year cost of ownership to their all-gas counterparts. The analysis showed that the 2010 Honda Civic Hybrid cost an additional $1830 over a 2010 Honda Civic EX 2D Coupe with an Automatic Transmission (the report assume 15,000 miles are driven annually and fuel prices are based on a weighted average over the five months prior to October 2010).\n\nIn August 2010, Autoblog reported that a replacement battery for the Civic Hybrid retailed at $2,100.\n\nThe Civic hybrid was introduced to Malaysia in August 2007. It was launched in China in November 2007 and in India in June 2008.\n\nThe Honda Civic Hybrid competed in 24 Hours Nürburgring in 2007, finishing 108th out of 220 teams starting. The twenty-four hour race is held around the Nürburgring, one of the world's most grueling courses. A Group N spec Honda Civic hybrid raced in the Jim Clark Rally and took second in class.\n\n\nThe last Civic Hybrid was launched during 2011 in the U.S. and Canada as a 2012 model. It has a larger 1.5-liter i-VTEC engine that produces 90 horsepower and 97 pound-feet of torque and a lithium-ion battery pack instead of nickel-metal hydride.\nThe larger engine replaces the 1.3-L engine for better mid-range torque. The DC brushless permanent magnet motor, which is placed between the engine and continuously variable transmission, provides 17 kW (23 hp) and 78 pound-feet of torque and weighs 0.7 kg (1.5 lb) less. The 2012 Civic Hybrid has an EPA rating of for the city and highway driving cycles, an improvement from city and highway for the previous generation.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid has the latest Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) parallel hybrid system, with a new 20 kW lithium-ion battery — a first for a Honda hybrid vehicle. The new battery is 5 kW more powerful, 9 kg (20 lb) lighter and takes up 36% less space. Battery capacity is increased from 35 kAh to 100 kAh (4.5 Ah).\n\nIt comes with improved aerodynamics and Honda ECO Assist technology. The ECO Assist technology is an information system to help the driver adopt a more fuel-efficient driving style, and is proven to improve fuel economy by about 10% for Honda's hybrid vehicles in Japan.\n\nProduction of the Civic hybrid sedan was moved from Suzuka, Japan to Indiana, United States in early 2013, following the production of the Acura ILX hybrid commenced at Indiana plant in April 2012, after production capacity was expanded to 250,000.\n\nIn February 2009, Honda reported that since 2001 they had sold more than 255,000 Civic Hybrids, including more than 190,000 units sold in North America. For a time, the Civic Hybrid was the second-best-selling hybrid electric car in the U.S.\n\nIt is reported that over 50,000 Civic Hybrids were sold during 2007 worldwide.\n\nIn January 2012, Heather Peters was awarded $9,867 by a Los Angeles Superior Court small-claims commissioner after alleging that her 2006 Civic Hybrid did not meet mileage claims advertised by the manufacturer.\n\nHonda won an appeal against this decision when a judge ruled that the vehicle’s fuel-economy ratings complied with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's requirements, and that such ratings are for the purpose of comparison among vehicles.\n\nConsumers who purchased or leased a 2003 through 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid had until April 19, 2013 to claim a cash payment and Rebate Certificate from the class action lawsuit settlement. However, the Settlement Administrator has already begun to review claims and began mailing checks last month to those with validated claims.\n\nIn March 2012 Honda Canada issued a release pledging to honor the USA class action settlement with owners and lessees in Canada when it was finalized in the USA. To date there has been no follow up to parties concerned, but shortly after the Honda release a class action was launched in Quebec courts on behalf of Quebec and Canadian owners and lessees.\n\nHonda announced that the Civic Hybrid was to be discontinued after the 2015 model year due to poor sales along with the Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid, Honda Civic GX, and Acura ILX Hybrid.\n\n"}

Due to cultural diffusion and emigration from these areas, samosas in today's world are also prepared in other regions.\n\nThe word \"samosa\" can be traced to the \"sanbosag\" (). The pastry's name in other countries can also derive from this root, such as the crescent-shaped \"sanbusak\" or \"sanbusaj\" in the Arab world, \"sambosa\" in Afghanistan, \"shingara\" (Bengali: ) in Bengal, \"samosa\" (Urdu:) in Pakistan, \"samosa\" (Hindi:) in India, \"()\", \"samboosa\" in Tajikistan, \"Sambôsy \" in Madagascar , \"samsa\" by Turkic-speaking nations, \"sambuus\" by Somalis of Somalia, Djibouti, Somali Region of Ethiopia and North Eastern Province of Kenya, and \"chamuça\" in Goa, Mozambique and Portugal. While they are currently referred to as \"sambusak\" in the Arabic-speaking world, Medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it \"sambusaj\".\n\nThe samosa originated in the Middle East and Central Asia. It then spread to Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. The term \"samosa\" and its variants cover a family of pastries and dumplings popular from north-eastern Africa to western China. An ancient recipe for samosa, widespread in the Near East and the Indian subcontinent, involves mixing 1 cup of oil, 1 cup of melted butter, 1 cup of warm water, and 1 teaspoon of salt with dough. The samosa spread to the Indian subcontinent, alongside the spread of Islam, during Muslim rule in the region. A praise of samosa (as \"sanbusaj\") can be found in a 9th-century poem by the Persian poet Ishaq al-Mawsili. Recipes for the dish are found in 10th–13th-century Arab cookery books, under the names \"sanbusak\", \"sanbusaq\", and \"sanbusaj\", all of which derive from the Persian word \"sanbosag\". In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century, its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the \"sambusas\" of Larestan). Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995-1077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, \"Tarikh-e Beyhaghi\".\n\nCentral Asian \"samsa\" were introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by traders from Central Asia. Amir Khusro (1253–1325), a scholar and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate, wrote in around 1300 CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the \"samosa prepared from meat, ghee, onion, and so on\". Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century traveler and explorer, describes a meal at the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, where the \"samushak\" or \"sambusak\", a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and spices, was served before the third course, of \"pulao\". \"Nimmatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi\", a medieval Indian cookbook started for Ghiyath al -Din Khalji, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India, mentions the art of making samosa. The \"Ain-i-Akbari\", a 16th-century Mughal document, mentions the recipe for \"qutab\", which it says, “the people of Hindustan call \"sanbúsah\"”.\n\nRegions where the dish serves as a staple of local cuisine have different ways of preparing it.\n\nThe samosa is made with all-purpose flour locally known as maida shell stuffed with some filling, generally a mixture of mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, spices and green chili, or fruits. The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely ghee to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in \"chaat\", along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yoghurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and \"chaat masala\". It can also be served with tomato sauce. Some people relish the crunchy samosa without any accompaniment.\n\nIn Delhi, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttarakhand, a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\nIn Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand, \"shingadas\" (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, shingaras are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in \"chaat\", along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and \"chaat masala\". Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. \"Fulkopir shingara\" (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called \"mangsher shingara\" (mutton shingara) and \"macher shingara\" (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as \"narkel er shingara\" (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with \"khoya\" and dipped in sugar syrup.\nIn Hyderabad, India, a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as \"lukhmi\", is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese \"chamuças\", with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in South India are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables. \nSamosa is one of the most popular Indian snack items. It ist vegetable or potato filling coated with maida dough and deep fried in oil. The Muslims prepare meat filled variations of the snack during Ramadan and other festive occasions. Mathri samosa is yet another popular snack in North India for spice-loving snack eaters.\n\nBoth flat-shaped and full-shaped samosas are popular snacks in Bangladesh. A Bengali version of the full-shaped samosa is called a সিঙাড়া (\"shingara\") and is normally much smaller than the standard variety. The \"shingara\" is usually filled with pieced potatoes and vegetables, however, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a \"somosa\" or \"somucha\", and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\nSamosas are called \"singadas\" in the eastern zone of Nepal; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in Nepalese cuisine. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\nSamosas of various types are available all over Pakistan. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern Sindh province and in the eastern Punjab, especially the city of Lahore, are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of Karachi are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from Faisalabad are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called \"kaghazi samosa\" (; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a wonton or spring roll wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, lentils, and minced meat (lamb, beef or chicken). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in Maldivian cuisine are known as \"bajiyaa\". They are filled with a mixture including fish or tuna and onions.\n\nSamosas are called \"samusas\" in Burmese, and are an extremely popular snack in Burma.\n\nThe local equivalent of samosas in Indonesia are known as \"pastel,\" closer to Spanish empanadas style, i.e. not so much curry/spices flavor as it is lightly seasoned compared to Indian samosa that are richer in spices.\n\nThe light thin pastry are usually filled with vegetables, minced beef, chicken or shrimp, topped with slices of egg depending on taste, before deep fried to golden color. As customary this popular snack is enjoyed with green hot chili padi.\n\nSamosas are a staple of local cuisine in the Horn of Africa, Djibouti and Somalia, where they are known as \"sambuus\". They are traditionally made with a thinner pastry dough, similar to egg roll wraps, and stuffed with ground beef. While they can be eaten any time of the year, they are usually reserved for special occasions.\n\nMany middle eastern countries include samosas in their cuisine. People in Saudi Arabia, for example, enjoy this dish as an appetizer. In the Holy Month of Ramadan, many Arabs and Muslims eat samosas everyday when they break their fast.\n\nIn Israel, a () may be a semicircular pocket of dough filled with mashed chickpeas, fried onions, and spices. Another variety is filled with meat, fried onions, parsley, spices, and pine nuts, which is sometimes mixed with mashed chickpeas and breakfast version with feta or tzfat cheese and \"za'atar\". It is associated with Mizrahi Jewish cuisine, and various recipes have been brought to Israel by Jewish migrants from other countries in the Middle East and Africa. According to food historian Gil Marks, sambusak has been a traditional part of the Sephardic Sabbath meal since the 13th century in Spain.\n\nIn Goa (India) and Portugal, samosas are known as \"chamuças\". They are usually filled with chicken, beef, pork, lamb or vegetables, and generally served quite hot. Samosas are an integral part of Goan and Portuguese cuisine, where they are a common snack.\n\nA samosa-inspired snack is also very common in Brazil, and relatively common in several former Portuguese colonies in Africa, including Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Angola, and Mozambique, where they are more commonly known as (in Brazil) or (in Portuguese Africa; in Brazilian Portuguese, refers to a completely different snack, always baked, small in size, and in the form of an inverse pudding). They are related to the Hispanic empanada and to the Italian calzone.\n\nSamosas are popular in the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, and are also growing in popularity in Canada, and the United States. They may be called \"samboosa\" or \"sambusac\", but in South Africa, they are often called \"samoosa\". Frozen samosas are increasingly available from grocery stores in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile samosas are traditionally fried, many Westerners prefer to bake them, as this is viewed as more convenient and more healthy by some diners. Variations using filo, or flour tortillas are sometimes used.\n"}

Dating back to ancient India, \"mehndi\" is still a popular form of body art among the women of the Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n\"Mehndi\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"mendhikā\". The use of mehndi and turmeric is described in the earliest Hindu Vedic ritual books. It was originally used for only women's palms and sometimes for men, but as time progressed, it was more common for men to wear it. Haldi (staining oneself with turmeric paste), as well as mehndi, are Vedic customs, intended to be a symbolic representation of the outer and the inner sun. Vedic customs are centered on the idea of \"awakening the inner light\". Traditional Indian designs are representations of the sun on the palm, which, in this context, is intended to represent the hands and feet. Mehendi has a great significance in performing classical dance like Bharatnatyam.\n\nThere are many variations and designs. Women usually apply mehndi designs to their hands and feet, though some, including cancer patients and women with alopecia occasionally decorate their scalps. The standard color of henna is brown, but other design colors such as white, red, black and gold are sometimes employed.\n\nPracticed mainly in the Indian subcontinent, \"mehndi\" is the application of a temporary form of skin decoration, popularized in the West by Indian cinema and the entertainment industry, the people in Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives also use mehndi. Mehndi decorations became fashionable in the West in the late 1990s, where they are called \"henna tattoos\".\n\n\"Mehndi\" in Indian tradition is typically applied during special Hindu weddings and Hindu festivals like Karva Chauth, Vat Purnima, Diwali, Bhai Dooj and Teej. In Hindu festivals, many women have Henna applied to their hands and feet and sometimes on the back of their shoulders too, as men have it applied on their arms, legs, back, and chest. For women, it is usually drawn on the palm, back of the hand and on feet, where the design will be clearest due to contrast with the lighter skin on these surfaces, which naturally contain less of the pigment melanin. Muslims in the Indian subcontinent also apply Mehndi during festivals such as Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha.\n\nAlta, Alata, or Mahur is a red dye used similarly to henna to paint the feet of the brides in South Asia, for instance in the Bengal region where it is done.\n\nLikely due to the desire for a \"tattoo-black\" appearance, some people add the synthetic dye p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) to henna to give it a black colour. PPD may cause severe allergic reactions and was voted Allergen of the Year in 2006 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.\n\nMehndi is a ceremonial art form which originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent. It is typically applied during weddings - for brides. In Rajasthan, the grooms are given designs that are often as elaborate as those for brides. In Assam, apart from marriage, it is broadly used by unmarried women during Rongali bihu.\n\nMuslims in Afghanistan also started to use it as an indication of coming of age. In the Middle East and Africa, it is common for women to apply henna to their fingernails and toenails and to their hands.\n\nHenna paste is usually applied to the skin using a plastic cone, a paintbrush or a stick. After about 15–20 minutes, the mud will dry and begin to crack, and during this time, a mixture of lemon juice and white sugar can be applied over the henna design to remoisten the henna mud so that the henna will stain darker. The painted area is then wrapped with tissue, plastic, or medical tape to lock in body heat, creating a more intense colour on the skin. The wrap (not a traditional method), is worn for two to six hours, or sometimes overnight, and then removed. When first removed, the henna design is pale to dark orange in colour and gradually darkens through oxidation, over the course of 24 to 72 hours. The final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin). Moisturizing with natural oils, such as olive, sesame seed, or coconut, will also help extend the lifetime of the stain. Skin exfoliation causes the henna tattoo to fade.\n\nTraditional weddings in South Asia can often be long, ritualistic, and elaborate affairs with many pre-wedding, wedding and post wedding ceremonies. Different countries and regions of a country celebrate the ceremonies in different ways according to their own marriage customs, rituals, and culture. A henna party is a tradition held before a wedding in many Middle Eastern and North African cultures. Henna parties were often held in the house that the bride was going to live in, and the guests included girls and women from the bride and groom's side of the family. The bride and all of her guests wore embroidered dresses called \"binalli\". In addition to this, the bride also wore a red veil that covered her face.\n\nAccording to Hindu tradition, the ceremony is mainly held at the bride's house or at a banquet hall on the eve of the marriage ceremony or few days before the marriage. Generally, the bride and groom attend the event together and on the occasion, a professional mehndi artist or a relative applies mehndi to the bride's hands and feet. The designs are very intricate. Often hidden within the mehndi pattern, the name or initials of the groom are applied. The event generally has a celebratory festival feel to it with the women dancing and singing traditional songs and the girls wearing vivid colors such as hot pink and yellow, often if the bride to be wishes to tease her future groom she will make him wear purple. The groom usually wears jutti instead of western footwear.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Mehndi ceremony is referred to Rasm-e-Heena and is often one of the most important pre-wedding ceremonies, which is celebrated by the bride's family. In Bangladesh, the Mehndi ceremony has traditionally been separated into two events; one organized by the bride's family and one, by the groom's family. Mehndi ceremonies take place outside the Indian subcontinent amongst the South Asian community and places like Birmingham in the UK are such known hotspots for lavish Mehndi celebrations.\n\nThe henna, a dye produced from a henna plant, would be delivered by the groom's relatives on a silver tray containing two burning candles. Before the application of the henna, the guests would throw coins over the bride's head as a symbol of fertility. Then, the bride's soon to be mother-in-law would then bring out a piece of silk cloth as a gift to the bride. The bride would then walk along the unrolled piece of silk cloth in the direction of her future mother-in-law and kiss her hand. \n<br >\nOnce this is done, fruits, nuts, and pastries would be brought out and songs would be sung in hopes of making the bride cry. This was done because it was thought that the bride's crying would bring good luck. The bride would then sit on a cushion while her mother-in-law placed a gold coin in her hand as another sign of good luck. Once the bride was given the gold coin, the henna would be applied.\n\nThe person who applied the henna was always someone who was already known to be happily married; that person would apply the henna onto the bride's palms, fingers, and toes. The henna was made from died henna leaves, and the process of application took a long time. For this reason, it was suggested that it be applied between thirty-two and forty-eight hours before the wedding so that it may have enough time to stain the skin. In addition to the bride, all unmarried persons at the henna party would also apply the henna to their hands, believing that it would allow them to be married soon as well.\n\n"}

Some versions may include peppers, mushrooms, bacon or pepperoni.\n\nPineapple as a pizza topping divides public opinion: Hawaiian was the most popular pizza in Australia in 1999, accounting for 15% of pizza sales, and a 2015 review of independent UK takeaways operating through Just Eat found the Hawaiian pizza to be the most commonly available. However, a 2016 survey of US adults had pineapple in the top three least favourite pizza toppings, ahead of anchovies and mushrooms.\n\nGreek-Canadian Sam Panopoulos claimed that he created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese dishes which commonly mix sweet and savoury flavours, Panopoulos experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon and other toppings which were not initially very popular.\nThe addition of pineapple to the traditional mix of tomato sauce and cheese, sometimes with ham or sometimes with bacon, soon became popular locally and eventually became a staple offering of pizzerias around the world.\n\nIn Germany, Hawaiian pizza is thought to be a variation of the ham, pineapple and cheese topped Toast Hawaii, originally introduced by Germany's first TV cook Clemens Wilmenrod in 1955.\n\nIn February 2017, the president of Iceland, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, reportedly told a group of high school students during a Q&A that he was fundamentally opposed to pineapple on pizza. He added that he would ban pineapple as a pizza topping if he could, as long as he received 30% of the under 21 vote. His off-the-cuff remark generated a flurry of media coverage and inspired those who liked and disliked of Hawaiian pizza to express their opinions on social media, some famous examples include Mitchell Collins from the IPI (Italian Pizza Inspectorate). Celebrities shared their preferences on the matter, including Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Panopoulos, at that point retired from the restaurant business, was called upon by some media outlets to defend his creation. Guðni later clarified in a Facebook post that he did not have the power to ban particular toppings on pizza and would not like to live in a country where the leader could ban anything he or she did not like.\n\n"}
{"id": "538663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=538663", "title": "Stargazy pie", "text": "Stargazy pie\n\nStargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie and other variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, covered with a pastry crust. Although there are a few variations with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing skyward. \n\nThe dish is traditionally held to have originated from the village of Mousehole in Cornwall and is traditionally eaten during the festival of Tom Bawcock's Eve to celebrate his heroic catch during a very stormy winter. According to the modern festival, which is combined with the Mousehole village illuminations, the entire catch was baked into a huge stargazy pie, encompassing seven types of fish and saving the village from starvation. The story of Bawcock was popularised by Antonia Barber's children's book \"The Mousehole Cat\", which featured the stargazy pie. In 2007 contestant Mark Hix won the BBC's \"Great British Menu\" with a variant of the dish.\n\nStargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, is filled with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, appearing to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the British Food Trust describes the dish as being fun as well as amusing to children, it has been listed in \"Yuck! Disgusting things people eat\", a lifestyle feature by the \"New York Daily News\" based upon the book by an American author, Neil Setchfield. On Tom Bawcock's Eve it is served in The Ship Inn, the only pub in Mousehole, sometimes after a re-enactment of the legend.\n\nThe pie originates from the fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with many parts of Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the pie is served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning that none of the fishing boats had been able to leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.\n\nOn 23 December, Tom Bawcock decided to brave the storms and went out in his fishing boat. Despite the stormy weather and the difficult seas, he managed to catch enough fish to feed the entire village. The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the Tom Bawcock's Eve festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole. The celebration and memorial to the efforts of Tom Bawcock sees the villagers parading a huge stargazy pie during the evening with a procession of handmade lanterns, before eating the pie itself.\n\nAn older feast, held by the fishermen towards the end of December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run against the backdrop of the Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.\n\nThere was a rumour that the entire festival was a fabrication by the landlord of The Ship Inn in the 1950s. However, festivities had been recorded by Morton Nance, an author on the Cornish language, in 1927 in the magazine \"Old Cornwall\". His description was regarding the festivities prior to 1900, though he doubted the reality of Tom Bawcock, suggesting it was in fact \"Beau Coc\". He also went on to confirm that the origins of the festival dated back to pre-Christian times, though it is unclear at what time the stargazy pie became part of the festivities. Morton Nance went on to restore the traditional song sung on Tom Bawcock's Eve, played to the local tune \"wedding March\".\n\nA legend surrounding stargazy pie, along with the other unusual pies of Cornwall, is that they were the reason that the Devil never came to Cornwall. In his book \"Popular romances of the west of England; or, The drolls, traditions, and superstitions of old Cornwall\", a collection of Cornish traditions, Robert Hunt explains that the Devil crossed the River Tamar to Torpoint. The chapter, entitled \"The Devil's Coits, etc\", reasons that the Devil discovered the Cornish would put anything in a pie and decided to leave before they took a fancy to a \"devilly\" pie, returning to Devon.\n\nThe original pie in the legend included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring is used as a substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) to make it easier to eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.\n\nThere are many recipe variations around the traditional ingredients, some of which include hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard or white wine. Other alternatives to the main fish can be crayfish and rabbit or mutton. The stargazy pie is always topped with a pastry lid, generally shortcrust but sometimes puff pastry, through which the fish heads and sometimes tails protrude.\n\nFor presentation, one suggestion is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward the centre of the pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.\n\nThe children's book \"The Mousehole Cat\" by Antonia Barber is inspired by Tom Bawcock's Eve. It is the story of Tom Bawcock and his loyal black and white cat, Mowzer, setting sail to catch the fish. When the boat hits the storm, it is represented by a giant \"Storm-Cat\", allowing Mowzer to eventually save the day by soothing the storm with her purring. This purring becomes a song and while the Storm-Cat is resting Tom is able to haul in his catch and return to the village. When they arrive back at the village, the entire catch is baked into a \"Star-Gazy\" pie, on which the villagers feast.\n\nThe main course of the second series of the \"Great British Menu\" was won by Mark Hix, head chef at The Ivy in London, with a variation on stargazy pie, which combined rabbit and crayfish for the filling, poking some crayfish through the pie crust. Hix had previously created a mutton and crayfish for a festival aimed at increasing the use of the meat, and it was served at his London restaurants for a time.\n\nAmerican rock band The Silver Seas (under their previous name The Bees U.S.) released an album called \"Starry Gazey Pie\" in 2004; the album and title track referred to a recipe in a cookbook which band member Daniel Tashian remembered from his childhood.\n\nThe 2004 film \"Ladies in Lavender\", starring Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, Daniel Brühl, Natascha McElhone and Miriam Margolyes, includes a scene where stargazy pie is prepared and served.\n\n\n"}

Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil's food from the more standard chocolate cake, though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker. The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting.\n\nDevil's food cake is commonly a dense, rich chocolate cake. It traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of unsweetened cocoa powder. However, contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares. Also, because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter, cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate. Moreover, coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor. Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake's main liquid, rather than milk. Its antithetical counterpart, the angel food cake, is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy.\nDevil's food cake is sometimes distinguished from other chocolate cakes by the use of additional baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which raises the pH level and makes the cake a deeper and darker mahogany color.

{"id": "539928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=539928", "title": "Totenkopf", "text": "Totenkopf\n\nTotenkopf (i.e. \"skull\", literally \"dead's head\") is the German word for the skull and crossbones (or \"death's head\") symbol. The \"Totenkopf\" symbol is an old international symbol for death, the defiance of death, danger, or the dead, as well as piracy. It consists usually of the human skull with or without the mandible and often includes two crossed long-bones (femurs), most often depicted with the crossbones being \"behind\" some part of the skull. \n\nIt is commonly associated with 19th- and 20th-century German military use.\n\n\"Toten-Kopf\" translates literally to \"dead's head\", meaning exactly \"dead person's head\". Semantically, it refers to a skull, literally a \"Schädel\". As a term, \"Totenkopf\" connotes the human skull as a symbol, typically one with crossed thigh bones as part of a grouping.\n\nContemporary German language meaning of the word \"Totenkopf\" has not changed for at least two centuries. For example, the German poet Clemens Brentano (1778–1842) wrote in the story \"\"Baron Hüpfenstich\"\": \"Lauter Totenbeine und Totenköpfe, die standen oben herum ...\" (i.e. \"A lot of bones and skulls, they were placed above ...\").\n\nThe common translation of \"Totenkopf\" as \"death's head\" is incorrect; it would be \"Todeskopf\", but no such word is in use. The English term death squad is called \"Todesschwadron\", not \"Totenschwadron\". It would be a logical fallacy to conclude that usage varies only because of the German naming of the death's-head hawkmoth, which is called \"skull hawkmoth\" (\"Totenkopfschwärmer\") in German, in the same way that it would be a fallacy to conclude that the German word \"Nachtkerze\" (i.e. night candle) would mean willowherb, just because the willowherb hawkmoth (\"Proserpinus proserpina\") is called \"night candle hawkmoth\" (\"Nachtkerzenschwärmer\", \"Proserpinus proserpina\") in German.\n\nUse of the \"Totenkopf\" as a military emblem began under Frederick the Great, who formed a regiment of Hussar cavalry in the Prussian army commanded by Colonel von Ruesch, the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 5 (von Ruesch). It adopted a black uniform with a \"Totenkopf\" emblazoned on the front of its mirlitons and wore it on the field in the War of Austrian Succession and in the Seven Years' War. The \"Totenkopf\" remained a part of the uniform when the regiment was reformed into Leib-Husaren Regiments Nr.1 and Nr.2 in 1808. \n\nIn 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition, Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel raised a force of volunteers to fight Napoleon Bonaparte, who had conquered the Duke's lands. The Brunswick corps was provided with black uniforms, giving rise to their nickname, the Black Brunswickers. Both hussar cavalry and infantry in the force wore a \"Totenkopf\" badge, either in mourning for the duke's father, Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who had been killed at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, or according to some sources, as a sign of revenge against the French. After fighting their way through Germany, the Black Brunswickers entered British service and fought with them in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo. The Brunswick corps was eventually incorporated into the Prussian Army in 1866.\n\nThe skull continued to be used by the Prussian and Brunswick armed forces until 1918, and some of the stormtroopers that led the last German offensives on the Western Front in 1918 used skull badges. \"Luftstreitkräfte\" fighter pilots Georg von Hantelmann and Kurt Adolf Monnington are just two of a number of Central Powers military pilots who used the \"Totenkopf\" as their personal aircraft insignia.\n\nThe \"Totenkopf\" was used in Germany throughout the inter-war period, most prominently by the \"Freikorps\". In 1933, it was in use by the regimental staff and the 1st, 5th, and 11th squadrons of the \"Reichswehr\"s 5th Cavalry Regiment as a continuation of a tradition from the \"Kaiserreich\".\n\nIn the early days of the Nazi Party, Julius Schreck, the leader of the \"Stabswache\" (Adolf Hitler's bodyguard unit), resurrected the use of the \"Totenkopf\" as the unit's insignia. This unit grew into the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), which continued to use the \"Totenkopf\" as insignia throughout its history. The name of the SS-Totenkopfverbände, the division of the SS that ran concentration camps and death camps, literally translats to \"Death's Head Units\". According to a writing by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, the \"Totenkopf\" had the following meaning:\n\nThe \"Skull\" is the reminder that you shall always be willing to put your self at stake for the life of the whole community.\n\nThe \"Totenkopf\" was also used as the unit insignia of the \"Panzer\" forces of the German \"Heer\" (Army), and also by the \"Panzer\" units of the Luftwaffe, including those of the elite Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring.\n\nBoth the 3rd SS Panzer Division of the Waffen-SS, and the World War II era Luftwaffe's 54th Bomber Wing \"Kampfgeschwader 54\" were given the unit name \"\"Totenkopf\"\", and used a strikingly similar-looking graphic skull-crossbones insignia as the SS units of the same name. The 3rd SS Panzer Division also had skull patches on their uniform collars instead of the SS sieg rune.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the skull & crossbones symbol has often been used to indicate a poisonous substance.\n\n\n"}

Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.\n\nThe first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.\n\nHot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced \"chocolate para mesa\" of Latin America, the very thick \"cioccolata calda\" served in Italy and \"chocolate a la taza\" served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.\n\nArachaelogists have found evidence that Mayan chocolate consumption occurred as early as 500 BC, and there is speculation that chocolate predates even the Mayans. To make the chocolate drink, which was served cold, the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with water, cornmeal, chili peppers, and other ingredients. They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a thick foam developed. Chocolate was available to Maya of all social classes, although the wealthy drank chocolate from \"large spouted vessels\" that were often buried with elites. An early Classic period (460-480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site of Rio Azul, Guatemala, had vessels with the Maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink.\n\nBecause sugar was yet to come to the Americas, \"xocōlātl\" was said to be an acquired taste. What the Spaniards then called \"xocōlātl\" was said to be a drink consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold. The drink tasted spicy and bitter as opposed to sweetened modern hot chocolate. As to when \"xocōlātl\" was first served hot, sources conflict on when and by whom. However, Jose de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described \"xocōlātl\" as:\n\nLoathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant taste. Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The Spaniards, both men and women, that are accustomed to the country, are very greedy of this Chocolate. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot, some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that \"chili\"; yea, they make paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh. Within Mesoamerica many drinks were made from cacao beans, and further enhanced by ﬂowers like vanilla to add flavor. This was a tribute to the Aztecs. The Aztecs, or Mexica, required conquered people to provide them with chocolate. Cups, gourds, cacao beans, as well as others things they acquired were listed in The Essential Codex Mendoza. Cacao became used as a currency throughout Mesoamerica. The Aztecs used chocolate to show high status: it was a bad omen for someone low or common to drink chocolate. Europeans' first recorded contact with chocolate wasn't until 1502 on Columbus's fourth voyage.\n\nAfter defeating Montezuma's warriors and demanding that the Aztec nobles hand over their valuables, Cortés returned to Spain in 1528, bringing cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment with them. At this time, chocolate still only existed in the bitter drink invented by the Mayas. Sweet hot chocolate and bar chocolate were yet to be invented. After its introduction to Europe, the drink slowly gained popularity. The court of King Charles V soon adopted the drink, and what was then only known as \"chocolate\" became a fashionable drink popular with the Spanish upper class. Additionally, cocoa was given as a dowry when members of the Spanish Royal Family married other European aristocrats. At the time, chocolate was very expensive in Europe because the cocoa beans only grew in South America.\n\nSweet-tasting hot chocolate was then invented, leading hot chocolate to become a luxury item among the European nobility by the 17th century. Even when the first Chocolate House (an establishment similar to a modern coffee shop) opened in 1657, chocolate was still very expensive, costing 50 to 75 pence (approximately 10-15 shillings) a pound (roughly £45-65 in 2016). At the time, hot chocolate was often mixed with spices for flavor; one notable recipe was hot chocolate \"infused with fresh jasmine flowers, amber, musk, vanilla and ambergris.\" In the late 17th century, Hans Sloane, president of the Royal College of Physicians, visited Jamaica. There, he tried chocolate and considered it \"nauseous\", but found it became more palatable when mixed with milk. When he returned to England, he brought the recipe with him, introducing milk chocolate to England. The aristocratic nature of the drink led to chocolate being referred to as \"the drink of the gods\" in 1797.\n\nThe Spanish began to use \"jicaras\" made of porcelain in place of the hollowed gourds used by the natives. They then further tinkered with the recipes by using spices such as cinnamon, black pepper, anise, and sesame. Many of these things were used to try to recreate the flavor of the native flowers which they could not easily acquire. Black pepper was used to replace chillies and \"mecaxochitl\", cinnamon was used in place of \"orejuelas\", sugar replaced honey. The goal was to create a whole new version to chocolate that they could call their own.\n\nIn 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten developed the first cocoa powder producing machine in the Netherlands. The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind. This powder, much like instant cocoa powder used today, was easier to stir into milk and water. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture chocolate bars. The term \"chocolate\" then came to mean solid chocolate rather than hot chocolate, with the first chocolate bar being created in 1847.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between \"hot cocoa\", made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans, and \"hot chocolate\", made directly from bar chocolate, which already contains cocoa, sugar, and cocoa butter. Thus, the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter, the absence of which makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate.\n\nHot chocolate can be made with dark, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate chopped into small pieces and stirred into milk with the addition of sugar. American instant hot cocoa powder often includes powdered milk or other dairy ingredients so it can be made without using milk. In the United Kingdom, \"hot chocolate\" is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water, and powder containing chocolate, sugar, and powdered milk. \"Cocoa\" usually refers to a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder, then sweetened to taste with sugar (or not sweetened at all).\n\nToday, hot chocolate in the form of drinking chocolate or cocoa is considered a comfort food and is widely consumed in many parts of the world. European hot chocolate tends to be relatively thick and rich, while in the United States the thinner instant version is consumed more often. In Nigeria hot chocolate is referred to as \"tea\" even though it is not actually a tea due to the Nigerian custom of referring to drinks consumed in the morning as \"tea\". Many regions have distinctive additives or toppings, ranging from marshmallow and whipped cream to cheese.Hot chocolate mixed with espresso or coffee is trending in coffee shops around the United states and all over the world under the name of Caffè mocha.This particular name comes from the town Mocha, Yemen ,where a specific blend of coffee with the same name is grown.\n\nIn mainland Europe (particularly Spain and Italy), hot chocolate is sometimes served very thick due to the use of a thickening agent such as cornstarch. One of the thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian \"cioccolata calda\".\n\nHot chocolate with churros is the traditional working-man's breakfast in Spain. This style of hot chocolate can be extremely thick, often having the consistency of warm chocolate pudding. In the Netherlands, hot chocolate is a very popular drink, known as \" warme chocolademelk\", it is often served at home or in cafes. In France, hot chocolate is often served at breakfast time; sometimes sliced bread spread with butter, jam, honey, or Nutella is dunked into the hot chocolate.\n\nIn Germany, hot chocolate made by melted chocolate (\"Heiße Schokolade Wiener Art\") is distinguished from those made from powders (\"Trinkschokolade\"). It is often served with whipped cream on top.\n\nEven further variations of hot chocolate exist. In some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe, one who orders a \"\"warme chocolade\"\" or \"\"chocolat chaud\"\" receives a cup of steaming white milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to dissolve in the milk. One Viennese variant \"Heiße Schokolade Wiener Art\" contains an egg yolk for thickness.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the drink is popular in instant form, made with hot water or milk from a packet containing mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk. This is the thinner of the two main variations. It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, or a piece of solid chocolate. Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755. Traditionally, hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather, winter, and dessert in the United States and Canada. United states is celebrating National Hot Chocolate Day on January, 31st.\n\nIn Mexico, hot chocolate remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as \"pan dulce\" or churros.\n\nIn Colombia, a hot chocolate drink made with milk and water using a chocolatera and molinillo is enjoyed as part of breakfast with bread and soft, fresh farmer's cheese. Colombian hot chocolate is often topped with a soft farmer's cheese or other mild cheese. Similarly, hot chocolate in Ecuador is often topped with cheese.\n\nIn Peru, hot chocolate can be served with panettone at breakfast on Christmas Day, even though summer has already started in the southern hemisphere. In addition, many Peruvians will add a sweet chocolate syrup to their drink. The Argentinian \"submarino\" is a hot chocolate drink made from adding a chocolate bar and sugar to \nhot steamed milk.\n\nIn the Philippines, the native hot chocolate drink is known as \"tsokolate\". It is made from \"tabliya\" (or \"tablea\"), tablets of pure ground roasted cacao beans, dissolved in water and milk. Like in Spanish and Latin American versions, the drink is traditionally made in a \"tsokolatera\" and briskly mixed with a wooden baton called the \"molinillo\" (also called \"batidor\" or \"batirol\"), causing the drink to be characteristically frothy. \"Tsokolate\" is typically sweetened with bit of \"muscovado\" sugar and has a distinctive grainy texture.\n\n\"Tsokolate\" is also known as \"suklati\" in Kapampangan; \"sikulate\" in Maguindanao; and \"sikwate\" or \"sikuwate\" in Visayan languages. All are derived from Spanish \"chocolate\" (\"chocolate\").\n\n\"Tsokolate\" is commonly consumed at breakfast with traditional \"kakanin\" delicacies or \"pandesal\" and other types of bread. It is also popular during Christmas season in the Philippines.\n\nAlthough hot chocolate is generally consumed for pleasure, the drink confers several potential health benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains large amounts of antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, hot chocolate was valued as a medicine as well as a drink.\n\nThe explorer Francisco Hernández wrote that chocolate drinks helped treat fever and liver disease. Another explorer, Santiago de Valverde Turices, believed that large amounts of hot chocolate were helpful in treating chest ailments and that smaller amounts could help stomach disorders. When chocolate was introduced to the French in the 17th century, it was reportedly used \"to fight against fits of anger and bad moods\", which may be attributed to chocolate's phenylethylamine content. Today, hot chocolate is consumed for pleasure rather than medicinally, but new research suggests that there may be other health benefits attributed to the drink.\n\nOn the other hand, several negative effects can be attributed to drinking hot chocolate, as some hot chocolate recipes contain high amounts of sugar, hydrogenated oils, or fats.\n\nBack when chocolate was first taking root in popularity it was opposed by the Catholic church. It was seen to lack the ability to break fast, seeing as it was consumed in its liquid form. Coffee was the other popular trend which was seen as good for the body but bad for the mind. Chocolate began being consumed as a way to replenish one's body from the effects that coffee caused. It was said to nourish one's body and potency.\n\nResearch has shown that the consumption of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University has shown that hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the drink is heated.\n\nThe flavonoids found in the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also have a positive effect on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa drink. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels. A study performed in 2006, by a group of scientists using a group of women ,showed that dietary flavonoids from cocoa contribute to endogenous photo protection, improve dermal blood circulation, and affect cosmetically the skin surface and hydration status.Overall women showed a boost in skin structure and function .\n\nIn further studies conducted by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.\n\nSeveral negative effects may be attributed to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed cocoa powder usually contains additional sugars. People who tend to consume frequently hot chocolate with high sugar content may be at risk for tooth decay , and increased triglycerides that may lead to weight gain The caloric content in a cup of hot chocolate can vary in dependence of the brand and recipe, if its is served with other additives such as whipped cream or /and marshmallows. For example, a 16 oz cup of Starbucks hot chocolate, topped with whipped cream , and chocolate sauce drizzle contains 400 calories from Fat 150. Some brands also contain hydrogenated oils and fats, the most common of which are coconut derivatives.\n\n\nIn 2012 a study conducted by Piqueras-Fiszman, B., & Spence, C. showed that the choice of the cup (color ,material) from which people drink hot chocolate , and other hot beverages influences how the flavor of the drink is perceived.When hot chocolate was consumed from dark-cream colored mugs , the flavor and aroma were found to be more intense and some participants even stated that the beverage tasted sweeter than in the other type of cups such as paper cups,plastic cups, white colored cups.\n\nIn 2009 the International Chocolate Salon started an annual hot chocolate award competition. Famous hot chocolate brands and chocolatiers from all over the world present their products , and are judged on best taste, best texture, best originality, and best ingredient combination.The judging members which include popular local Chefs, food Gurus,national newspapers and magazines, and blog editors decide the top finalists.The winners are proud to use and display the Official Award Winner title and award logos .\n\n\n"}

It outweighs the Cullinan I by 15.37 carats (3.07 g). The Golden Jubilee Diamond was discovered in the Premier Mine, which is also the origin of the Cullinan diamond (1905) and other notables such as the Taylor–Burton (1966) and the Centenary (1986). Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, had held the title of the largest cut and faceted diamond since 1908.\n\nFirst known as the \"Unnamed Brown\", the Golden Jubilee Diamond was cut from a large brown diamond of 755.5 carats (151 g), found in the prolific blue ground of the Premier Mine in South Africa in 1985.\n\nUntil 1990, the diamond remained largely unknown to the outside world, requiring two years work to bring it to its current state. A large surface and deep cracks from the interior, as well as several inclusions, meant that cutting and polishing the big diamond presented challenges. De Beers considered this as an opportunity to test new cutting technologies. The same technology used in cutting the future Golden Jubilee diamond was later used in the cutting of the Centenary Diamond, a smaller (273.85 carats) flawless and colorless rough diamond. \n\nGabriel Tolkowsky was hired by De Beers to cut the diamond and also so he could test special tools and cutting methods that were being developed for use on the colourless D-colour Centenary. \n\nBecause of its cracks and inclusions, it was decided by De Beers and Gabriel Tolkowsky to construct an underground room that was free from vibration before work could begin on the diamond. In 1990, after two years of work, the stone was finished, reduced in total from 755.50 carats, to 545.65 carats. Gabi Tolkowsky described the cut as a “Fire-Rose cushion shape.”\n\nThe unnamed diamond was brought to Thailand by the Thai Diamond Manufacturers Association to be exhibited in the Thai Board of Investment Exhibition in Laem Chabang and was selected to herald De Beer's centennial celebrations in 1988.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee was purchased from De Beers by a group of Thai business people led by Henry Ho in 1995.\n\nIt was arranged for the diamond to be given to King Bhumibol as a gift from the people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the King’s ascent to the throne. The diamond was named the Golden Jubilee, and was received by the King’s daughter, Princess Matia Chakri Sirindhom, on his behalf in 2000.\n\nThe diamond is now on display in the Royal Museum at Pimammek Golden Temple Throne Hall in Bangkok as part of the crown jewels. \n\nThe diamond was brought to Pope John Paul II in the Vatican to receive a papal blessing. It was also blessed by the Buddhist Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and the Islamic Chularatchamontri.\n\nThe diamond () was named by King Bhumibol Adulyadej and given to him in honour of his 50th coronation anniversary. It was initially planned to mount the Golden Jubilee in the royal sceptre. A subsequent plan was to mount it in a royal seal.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee Diamond has been exhibited at Henry Ho's 59-story Jewelry Trade Center in Bangkok, the Central Department Store in Lat Phrao (Bangkok), and internationally in Basel (Switzerland), Borsheims in Omaha, Nebraska, USA (owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), and Gleims Jewelers in Palo Alto, California. USA. It is now located in the Grand Palace as part of the Crown jewels.\n\nThe value of the Golden Jubilee diamond is believed to range between $4 and $12 million USD. If sold at auction, it is likely that this stone would fetch a significantly higher price.\n"}
{"id": "541633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=541633", "title": "Praeses", "text": "Praeses\n\nPraeses (Latin  \"praesides\") is a Latin word meaning \"placed before\" or \"at the head\". In antiquity, notably under the Roman Dominate, it was used to refer to Roman governors; it continues to see some use for various modern positions.\n\n\"Praeses\" began to be used as a generic description for provincial governors—often through paraphrases, such as \"qui praeest\" (\"he who presides\")—already since the early Principate, but came in general use under the Antonines. The jurist Aemilius Macer, who wrote at the time of Caracalla (reigned 198–217), insists that the term was applied only to the governors who were also senators—thereby excluding the equestrian \"procuratores\"—but, while this may reflect earlier usage, it was certainly no longer the case by the time he wrote. In the usage of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the term appears originally to have been used as an honorific, affixed to the formal gubernatorial titles (\"legatus Augusti\" etc.), and even, occasionally, for legion commanders or fiscal \"procuratores\". By the mid-3rd century, however, \"praeses\" had become an official term, including for equestrian officials. The form \"vice praesidis\" had also come into common use for equestrian \"procuratores\" entrusted with the governance of provinces in the absence of, or in lieu of, the regular (senatorial) governor. This marks a decisive step in the assumption of full provincial governorships by equestrians, with the first equestrian \"praesides provinciae\" appearing in the 270s.\n\nThis evolution was formalized in the reforms of Diocletian (r. 284–305) and Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), when the term \"praeses\" came to designate a specific class of provincial governors, the lowest after the \"consulares\" and the \"correctores\". In the East, however, they ranked between the two other classes, possibly because the few \"correctores\" there were instituted after the \"praesides\". The term \"praeses\" remained in general use for provincial governors, and was still used in legal parlance to designate all classes of provincial governors collectively. In common usage, the \"praesides\" were often also designated by more generic titles such as \"iudex\" (\"judge\"), \"rector\" or \"moderator\", and sometimes archaically as \"praetor\". In Greek, the term was rendered as (\"hegemon\").\n\nMost of the provinces created by Diocletian by splitting the larger older ones were entrusted to such \"praesides\", and they form the most numerous group of governors in the late-4th century \"Notitia Dignitatum\":\n\n\n\nIn the East, the staff (\"officium\") of the \"praeses\" (attested for Thebais) comprised the same as that of a \"consularis\", i.e. a \"princeps officii\", \"cornicularius\", \"commentariensis\", \"adiutor\", \"numerarius\", \"ab actis\", \"a libellis\", \"subadiuva\"; finally unspecified \"exceptores\" and \"cohortalini\" (menial staff). In the West (attested for Dalmatia), the \"officium\" was again the same as with the \"consulares\" and \"correctores\", comprising the \"princeps officii\", \"cornicularius\", two \"tabularii\", \"commentariensis\", \"adiutor\", \"ab actis\", \"subadiuva\", and the usual \"exceptores\" and \"cohortalini\".\n\nThe status of a \"praeses\" could also be awarded as a separate honour, \"ex praeside\", attached to the rank of \"vir perfectissimus\".\n\nIn German academia a doctoral advisor is called the \"Doktorvater\". However, in the 18th century and before, the doctoral system was quite different. Instead of a Doktorvater as such, the candidate had a \"praeses\" to act as mentor and who would also head the oral \"viva voce\" exam. In the 18th century the \"praeses\" often chose the subject and compiled the theses and the candidate had only to defend. Sometimes there were several candidates at the same time defending the same thesis, in order to save time.\n\nThe chair of a student society in the Netherlands or Belgium may be called a praeses; in Dutch the official spelling has changed to \"\"preses\"\" but most student societies still observe the Latin spelling. Various minor offices may be designated by a compound title, e.g. \"dooppraeses\" in charge of initiation and associated hazing.\n\nIn Norway, the office of archbishop has been abolished. Instead, the Lutheran Church of Norway has a Bishops Conference which is presided over by a \"praeses\".\nThe church bodies Evangelical Church in the Rhineland and Evangelical Church of Westphalia, in which the title and function of bishop are unknown, are also chaired by a \"praeses\" ().\nIn other German church bodies the title usually refers to the president of the synod. \n\nRoman Catholic monastic institutions, especially Franciscan ones, use the term to indicate the presiding officer of a collegial meeting of the order.\n\nThe official Scots title of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament is \"Preses o the Scots Pairlament\".\n\nThe Polish word \"prezes\", derived from Latin \"praeses\" means \"chairman\".\n"}

Whereas words like \"sufficient\" and \"average\" suggest some degree of abstinence, scarcity, or failure, \"lagom\" carries the connotation of appropriateness, although not necessarily perfection. The archetypical Swedish proverb \"\"Lagom är bäst\"\", literally \"The right amount is best\", is also translated as \"Enough is as good as a feast\". That same proverb is translated as \"There is virtue in moderation\".\n\nThe word \"\"lagom\"\" also exists in Norwegian, in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The connotations in Norwegian, however, are somewhat different from Swedish. In Norwegian the word has synonyms as \"fitting, suitable, comfortable, nice, decent, well built/proportioned\". While some synonyms are somewhat similar in meaning (e.g. \"suitable\" and \"reasonable\", \"fitting\" and \"in balance\"), many present in Swedish do not exist in Norwegian and vice versa. The Norwegian words \"\"passelig\"\" and the more common \"\"passe\"\" are very similar, translating roughly as \"fitting, adequate, suitable\" in English. \"\"Passe\"\" can be used in every context where the Swedish \"\"lagom\"\" is used, e.g. \"\"passe varm\"\" (right temperature/adequately warm), \"\"passe stor\"\" (right size), etc.\n\nIn Finland \"lagom\" is used by the Swedish-speaking Finns who are familiar with the term and the concept behind it. Finnish_Language has the word \"Sopivasti\", which carries similar connotations of \"just right\".\n\nThe concept of \"lagom\" is similar to Russian expression \"normal'no\" (\"нормально\", literally normally), which indicates a sufficient and sustainable state, for example of one's livelihood. In Russian, the word is often used as answer to the question \"how are you\". Comparable terms are found in some south Slavic languages, for example Serbian and Croatian \"umereno\" or \"umjereno\".\n\nΙn ancient Greek, there was the famous phrase of Cleobulus, \"metron ariston\" (), meaning \"moderation [literally: measure] is best\".\n\nIn Albanian there is the same use of word \"taman\". The word \"taman\" derives from Ottoman Turkish \"tamam\" meaning \"precisely\", borrowed from Arabic where it means \"complete\", \"perfect\". In Albanian is used pretty much the same as \"lagom\", as in \"a \"taman\" amount\", \"not a \"taman\" person\" (not a normal person), \"taman!\" (agreed, OK), etc. This word (\"taman\") is also used in some Slavic languages (South Slavic) and it almost perfectly translates \"lagom\" to those languages.\n\nIn Thai, the word พอเพียง (phor phiang) portrays similar meaning.\n\nIn Indonesia, both Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese, there is a common word for that, \"pas,\" which means right amount (countable measurement), match, enough.\n\nThe origin of the term is an archaic dative plural form of \"lag\" (\"law\"), in this case referring not necessarily to judicial law but common sense law. A translation of this could be \"according to common sense\". A popular folk etymology claims that it is a contraction of \"\"laget om\"\" (\"around the team\"), a phrase used in Viking times to specify how much mead one should drink from the horn as it was passed around in order for everyone to receive a fair share. This story is recounted widely but explains the concept of lagom very well.\n\nParallels can be drawn from \"\"lagom\"\" to the Law of Jante, which in short says that a group member should not think they are better than anyone else, which indicates that \"\"lagom\"\" could mean \"the appropriate amount, according to the Law of Jante\", for example, the phrase \"take \"lagom\" with sugar\" would mean \"do not take more sugar than one should\".\n\n\"Lagom\" is most often used as an adverb, as in the sentence \"\"Han är lagom lång\"\" (literally \"He is just the right height\"). \"Lagom\" can also be used as an adjective: \"\"Klänningen var lagom för henne\"\" (literally \"The dress was just right for her\"), which would be equivalent to \"The dress fits her\". The adjective form is never inflected.\n\nLagom can be applied to almost all situations, from food and drink to copyright law and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe value of \"just enough\" can be compared to idiom \"less is more\", or contrasted to the value of \"more is better\". It is viewed favorably as a sustainable alternative to the hoarding extremes of consumerism: \"Why do I need more than two? \"Det är\" [It is] \"lagom\"\" It can also be viewed as repressive: \"You're not supposed to be too good, or too rich\".\n\nIn a single word, \"lagom\" is said to describe the basis of the Swedish national psyche, one of consensus and equality. In recent times Sweden has developed greater tolerance for risk and failure as a result of severe recession in the early 1990s. Nonetheless, it is still widely considered ideal to be modest and avoid extremes. \"My aunt used to hold out her closed fist and say, \"How much can you get in this hand? It's much easier to get something in \"this\" [open] hand\". \"It's the idea that for everything there is the perfect amount: The perfect, and best, amount of food, space, laughter and sadness.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "546314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=546314", "title": "Jewish humor", "text": "Jewish humor\n\nJewish humor is the long tradition of humor in Judaism dating back to the Torah and the Midrash from the ancient Middle East, but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal and often anecdotal humor of Ashkenazi Jews which took root in the United States over the last hundred years, including in secular Jewish culture. European Jewish humor in its early form developed in the Jewish community of the Holy Roman Empire, with theological satire becoming a traditional way of clandestinely opposing Christianization.\n\nModern Jewish humor emerged during the nineteenth century among German-speaking Jews of the \"Haskalah\" (Jewish Enlightenment), matured in the shtetls of the Russian Empire, and then flourished in twentieth-century America, arriving with the millions of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the early 1920s. \n\nBeginning with vaudeville, and continuing through radio, stand-up comedy, film, and television, a disproportionately high percentage of American, German, and Russian comedians have been Jewish. \"Time\" estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.\n\nJewish humor, while diverse, favors wordplay, irony, and satire, and its themes are highly anti-authoritarian, mocking religious and secular life alike. Sigmund Freud considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking of the in-group (Jews) rather than the \"other\". However rather than simply being self-deprecating it also contains a dialectical element of self-praise, which works in the opposite direction.\n\nJewish humor is rooted in several traditions. Recent scholarship places the origins of Jewish humor in one of history's earliest recorded documents, the Hebrew Bible, as well as the Talmud. In particular, the intellectual and legal methods of the Talmud, which uses elaborate legal arguments and situations often seen as so absurd as to be humorous, in order to tease out the meaning of religious law.\n\nHillel Halkin in his essay about Jewish humor traces some roots of the Jewish self-deprecating humor to the medieval influence of Arabic traditions on the Hebrew literature by quoting a witticism from Yehuda Alharizi's \"Tahkemoni\". A later Sephardic tradition centered on a Nasreddin-derived folk character known as Djohá.\n\nA more recent one is an egalitarian tradition among the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe in which the powerful were often mocked subtly, rather than attacked overtly—as Saul Bellow once put it, \"Oppressed people tend to be witty.\" Jesters known as badchens used to poke fun at prominent members of the community during weddings, creating a good-natured tradition of humor as a levelling device. Rabbi Moshe Waldoks, a scholar of Jewish humor, argued:\n\nAfter Jews began to immigrate to America in large numbers, they, like other minority groups, found it difficult to gain mainstream acceptance and obtain upward mobility (As Lenny Bruce lampooned, \"He was charming. ... They said, 'C'mon! Let's go watch the Jew be charming!'\"). The newly-developing entertainment industry, combined with the Jewish humor tradition, provided a potential route for Jews to succeed. One of the first successful radio \"sitcoms\", \"The Goldbergs\", featured a Jewish family. As radio and television matured, many of its most famous comedians, including Jack Benny, Sid Caesar, George Burns, Eddie Cantor, Jack Carter, Henny Youngman, Milton Berle, and Jerry Lewis were Jewish. The Jewish comedy tradition continues today, with Jewish humor much entwined with that of mainstream humor, as comedies like \"Seinfeld\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", and Woody Allen films indicate.\n\nSigmund Freud in his \"Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious\", among other things, analyzes the nature of Jewish jokes.\n\nAs befits a community to which religion was so important, much humor centres on the relationship of Judaism to the individual Jew and the community.\n\nThe cognate to this is the part left out, the fact that it was traditional to go to services, regardless of what one believed, and the rabbi was merely following that tradition. This is like the story of the boy who tells his rabbi he can't daven (pray), because he no longer believes in God. The rabbi merely tells him, \"Yes God, no God: doesn't matter! Three times a day, you DAVEN!\"\n\nThe American Jewish community has been lamenting the rate of assimilation and disappearance of their children as they grow into adults.\n\nOr,\n\nJews often mock their own negative stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, in the tradition of the legal arguments of the Talmud, one prominent type of Jewish humor involves clever, often legalistic, solutions to Talmudic problems, such as:\n\nSome jokes make fun of the \"Rebbe miracle stories\" and involve different hasidim bragging about their teachers' miraculous abilities:\nOr\nThe lives of the early hasidim, while not funny in and of themselves, are rich in humorous incidents. The dealings between rabbis, tzadikim, and peasants form a rich tapestry of lore.\n\nA number of traditions in Jewish humor date back to stories and anecdotes from the 19th century.\n\nJewish folklore makes fun of the Jewish residents of Chełm (Yiddish: כעלעם, Hebrew: חלם; often transcribed as Helm) as well-meaning fools. These stories often center around the \"wise\" men and their silly decisions, similarly to the English Wise Men of Gotham or the German Schildbürger.\n\nFor example: One Jewish Chełm resident bought a fish on Friday in order to cook it for Sabbath. He put the live fish underneath his coat and the fish slapped his face with his tail. He went to the Chełm court to submit a charge and the court sentenced the fish to death by drowning.\n\nMost of these stories have become well-known thanks to storytellers and writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Nobel Prize-winning Jewish writer in the Yiddish language, who wrote \"The Fools of Chełm and Their History\" (published in English translation in 1973), and the great Soviet Yiddish poet who wrote stories in verse. The latter achieved great popularity in the Soviet Union in Russian and Ukrainian translations, and were made into several animated films.\n\nOther notable adaptations of folklore Chełm stories into the mainstream culture are the comedy \"Chelmer Khakhomim\" (\"The Wise Men of Chelm\") by Aaron Zeitlin, \"The Heroes of Chelm\" (1942) by Shlomo Simon, published in English translation as \"The Wise Men of Helm\" (Solomon Simon, 1945) and \"More Wise Men of Helm\" (Solomon Simon, 1965), and the book \"Chelmer Khakhomim\" by Y. Y. Trunk. The animated short film comedy \"Village of Idiots\" also recounts Chełm tales.\n\nAllen Mandelbaum's \"\" (David R. Godine, 1978) treats the wise men less as fools than as an \"echt Chelm\" of true scholars who in their narrow specialized knowledge are nonetheless knowledgeable but lacking sense. \nThe poetry of [Chelmaxioms] is supposedly the discovered lost manuscripts of the wise men of Chelm. \n\nOne popular humorous tradition from Eastern Europe involved tales of the people of Chełm, a town reputed in these jokes to be inhabited by fools. The jokes were almost always centred on silly solutions to problems. Some of these solutions display \"foolish wisdom\" (reaching the correct answer by the wrong train of reasoning), while others are simply wrong.\n\nChełm tales were told by authors like Sholom Aleichem, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Solomon Simon. A typical Chełm story might begin, \"It is said that after God made the world, he filled it with people. He sent off an angel with two sacks, one full of wisdom and one full of foolishness. The second sack was much heavier. So after a time it started to drag. Soon it got caught on a mountaintop and so all the foolishness spilled out and fell into Chełm.\" The short animated film \"Village of Idiots\" is based upon classic Chełm tales.\n\nHere are a few examples of a Chełm tale:\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nHershele Ostropoler, also known as Hershel of Ostropol, was a legendary prankster who was based on a historic figure. Thought to have come from Ukraine, he lived in the small village of Ostropol, working as \"shochet\", a ritual slaughterer. According to legend he lost his job because of his constant joking, which offended the leaders of the village.\n\nIn his subsequent wanderings throughout Ukraine, he became a familiar figure at restaurants and inns.\n\nEventually he settled down at the court of Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh, grandson of the Baal Shem Tov. The rabbi was plagued by frequent depressions, and Hershele served as a sort of court jester, mocking the rabbi and his cronies, to the delight of the common folk.\n\nAfter his death he was remembered in a series of pamphlets recording his tales and witty remarks.\n\nHe was the subject of several epic poems, a novel, a comedy performed in 1930 by the Vilna Troupe, and a U.S. television programme in the 1950s. Two illustrated children's books, \"The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol\", and \"Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins\", have been published. Both books were written by Eric Kimmel and illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. In 2002, a play entitled \"Hershele the Storyteller\" was performed in New York City.\n\nMuch Jewish humor takes the form of self-deprecating comments on Jewish culture, acting as a shield against antisemitic stereotypes by exploiting them first:\n\nOr, on a similar note:\n\nAnd another example, a direct slice of \"galgenhumor\" (gallows humor):\n\nThere is also humor originating in the United States, such as this joke:\n\nThis one combines accusations of the lack of patriotism, and avarice:\n\nSome Yiddish words may sound comical to an English speaker. Terms like shnook and shmendrik, shlemiel and shlimazel (often considered inherently funny words) were exploited for their humorous sounds, as were \"Yinglish\" shm-reduplication constructs, such as \"fancy-schmancy\". Yiddish constructions—such as ending sentences with questions—became part of the verbal word play of Jewish comedians.\n\nOne common strain of Jewish humor examines the role of religion in contemporary life, often gently mocking the religious hypocrite. For example:\n\nOr, on differences between Orthodox, Conservative and Reform movements:\n\nIn particular, Reform Jews may be lampooned for their rejection of traditional Jewish beliefs. An example, from one of Woody Allen's early stand-up routines:\nJokes have been made about the shifting of gender roles (in the more traditional Orthodox movement, women marry at a young age and have many children, while the more liberal Conservative and Reform movements make gender roles more egalitarian, even ordaining women as Rabbis). The Reconstructionist movement was the first to ordain homosexuals, all of which leads to this joke:\n\nOften jokes revolve around the \"social\" practice of the Jewish religion:\n\nAs with most ethnicities, jokes have often mocked Jewish accents—at times gently, and at others quite harshly. One of the kinder examples is:\n\nJewish humor continues to exploit stereotypes of Jews, both as a sort of \"in-joke\", and as a form of self-defence. Jewish mothers, \"cheapness\", hypochondria, and other stereotyped habits are all common subjects. Frugality has been frequently singled out:\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr, about traditional roles of men and women in Jewish families:\n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nOr, on parenting (from David Bader's \"Haikus for Jews\"):\n\nOr\n\nRegarding hypochondria:\n\nOr, on kvetching,\n\nA version of that joke is quoted in \"Born To Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All Its Moods\", by Michael Wex, who writes,\n\nMany Jewish jokes involve a rabbi and a Christian clergyman, exploiting different interpretations of a shared environment. Often they start with something like \"A rabbi and a priest...\" and make fun of either the rabbi's interpretation of Christianity or (seeming) differences between Christian and Jewish interpretation of some areas.\n\nOr, much more succinctly,\n\nA few more examples:\n\nOr,\n\nOr, \n\nOr,\n\nOr,\n\nAnd finally, possibly the most gigantic clash of religions:\n\nHowever, current events, situations, traditions, and cultural factors which are unique to the country make it hard to understand the joke for someone who is not aware of the events being referred to.\n\nIn the Stalinist police state, it was not uncommon to get purged not only for telling a casual joke, but even for not reporting it to the authorities. \"See Russian jokes in general, or more specifically Rabinovich jokes, Russian Jewish jokes, Russian political jokes; also History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union.\"\nOr\n\nOr\n\nOr, in the last years of the Soviet Union:\n\nOr\nIsraeli humor featured many of the same themes as Jewish humor elsewhere, making fun of the country and its habits, while containing a fair bit of gallows humor as well, as a joke from a 1950 Israeli joke book indicates:\n\nIsraelis' view of themselves:\nFinally, in a clash of Rabbinical humor and Israeli humor:\n\n\n\n"}

The powder is used to add its distinctive flavor to beverages and other foods, but it is also used in baking to help the dough cook properly.\n\nMalt powder comes in two forms: diastatic and nondiastatic. Diastatic malt contains enzymes that break down starch into sugar; this is the form bakers add to bread dough to help the dough rise and create a certain crust. Nondiastatic malt, on the other hand, has no active enzymes and is used primarily for flavor, mostly in beverages. It sometimes contains sugar, coloring agents, and other additives, depending on the commercial preparation.\n\nLondon pharmacist James Horlick developed ideas for an improved, wheat- and malt-based nutritional supplement for infants. Despairing of his opportunities in the United Kingdom, Horlick joined his brother William, who had gone to Racine, Wisconsin in the United States, to work at a relative's quarry. In 1873, the brothers formed J & W Horlicks to manufacture their brand of infant food in nearby Chicago. Ten years later, they earned a patent for a new formula enhanced with dried milk. The company originally marketed its new product as \"Diastoid\", but trademarked the name \"malted milk\" in 1887.\n\nDespite its origins as a health food for infants and invalids, malted milk found unexpected markets. Explorers appreciated its lightweight, nonperishable, nourishing qualities, and they took malted milk on treks worldwide. William Horlick became a patron of Antarctic exploration, and Admiral Richard E. Byrd named Horlick Mountains, a mountain range in Antarctica, after him. Back in the US, people began drinking Horlick's new beverage for enjoyment. James Horlick returned to England to import his American-made product and was eventually made a baronet. Malted milk became a standard offering at soda shops, and found greater popularity when mixed with ice cream in a \"malt\", for which malt shops were named.\n\n\n\"Malted Milk\" is the title of a blues song written by Robert Johnson, famously interpreted by Eric Clapton on his album \"Unplugged\".\n\n"}
{"id": "548251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=548251", "title": "Usonia", "text": "Usonia\n\nUsonia () was a word used by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright to refer to his vision for the landscape of the United States, including the planning of cities and the architecture of buildings. Wright proposed the use of the adjective \"Usonian\" in place of \"American\" to describe the particular New World character of the American landscape as distinct and free of previous architectural conventions.\n\n\"Usonian\" usually refers to a group of approximately sixty middle-income family homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright beginning in 1934 with the Willey House. The \"Usonian Homes\" are typically small, single-story dwellings without a garage or much storage. They are often L-shaped to fit around a garden terrace on unusual and inexpensive sites. They are characterized by native materials; flat roofs and large cantilevered overhangs for passive solar heating and natural cooling; natural lighting with clerestory windows; and radiant-floor heating. A strong visual connection between the interior and exterior spaces is an important characteristic of all Usonian homes. The word carport was coined by Wright to describe an overhang for sheltering a parked vehicle.\n\nThe Usonia Historic District is a planned community in Pleasantville, New York built in the 1950s following this concept. Wright designed 3 of the 47 homes himself.\n\nVariants of the Jacobs House design are still in existence today. The Usonian design is considered among the aesthetic origins of the ranch-style house popular in the American west of the 1950s.\n\nIn 2013, Florida Southern College constructed the 13th Wright building on their campus according to plans that he created in 1939. The 1,700 sq. ft. building includes textile-block construction, colored glass in perforated concrete blocks, Wright photographs, a documentary film about the architect's work at the school, and furniture designed by Wright. Named the \"Usonian House\", it was originally designed as one of twenty faculty housing units. The building is home to the Sharp Family Tourism and Education Center, a visitor center for guests visiting campus to see the collection of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings.\n\nThe word \"Usonian\" appears to have been coined by James Duff Law, an American writer born in 1865. In a miscellaneous collection entitled, \"Here and There in Two Hemispheres\" (1903), Law quoted a letter of his own (dated June 18, 1903) that begins \"We of the United States, in justice to Canadians and Mexicans, have no right to use the title 'Americans' when referring to matters pertaining exclusively to ourselves.\" He went on to acknowledge that some author had proposed \"Usona\", but that he preferred the form \"Usonia\". Perhaps the earliest published use by Wright was in 1927:\n\nHowever, this seems to be a misattribution, as there is as yet no published evidence that Butler ever used the word.\n\nIt has become the established name for the United States in Esperanto. The creator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, used \"Usono\" in his speech at the 1910 World Congress of Esperanto in Washington, D.C., coincidentally the same year Wright was in Europe. But it was already well-established by 1908, when Joseph Rhodes, a fellow of the British Esperanto Association and a member of the Lingva Komitato, published \"The English-Esperanto Dictionary\" which was:\n\nbased upon the \"Fundamento,\" the Esperanto literature, and the national-Esperanto dictionaries bearing Dr. Zamenhof's \"aprobo\"\n\nJosé F. Buscaglia-Salgado reclaims the term Usonian to refer to the peoples, national ideology and neo-imperial tradition of the United States of America.\n\nMiguel Torres-Castro uses the term Usonian to refer to the origin of the Atlantic Puffin bird used in the children's book \"Jupu the Puffin: A Usonian Story\". The bird is a puffin from Maine, USA.\n\n\n\n"}

The separate terms can be translated as follows:\n\nThe compound terms have been translated as follows: \n\nWhile the latter parsing and translation is more traditional, the former has been given etymological and contextual authority by contemporary Buddhist scholars such as Bhikkhu Analayo and Bhikkhu Bodhi.\n\nAnālayo argues from an etymological standpoint that, while \"foundation ['] of mindfulness\" is supported by the Pāli commentary, the term ' (foundation) was otherwise unused in the Pāli nikayas and is only first used in the Abhidhamma. In contrast, the term ' (presence or establishment) can in fact be found throughout the nikayas and is readily visible in the Sanskrit equivalents of the compound Pāli phrase ' (Skt., ' or '). Thus Anālayo states that \"presence of mindfulness\" (as opposed to \"foundation of mindfulness\") is more likely to be etymologically correct.\n\nLike Anālayo, Bodhi assesses that \"establishment [] of mindfulness\" is the preferred translation. However, Bodhi's analysis is more contextual than Anālayo's. According to Bodhi, while \"establishment of mindfulness\" is normally supported by the textual context, there are exceptions to this rule, such as with SN 47.42 where a translation of \"foundation of mindfulness\" is best supported. Soma uses both \"foundations of mindfulness\" and \"arousing of mindfulness.\"\n\nTraditionally, mindfulness is thought to be applied to four domains, \"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\" The four domains are:\n\n\"Dhammā\" is often translated as \"mental objects\". According to Anālayo translating \"dhamma\" as \"mental object\" is problematic for multiple reasons. The three prior \"satipatthāna\" (body, sensations, mind) can become mental objects in themselves, and those objects, such as the hindrances, aggregates and sense bases, identified under the term \"dhamma\" are far from an exhaustive list of all possible mental objects. Anālayo translates \"dhammā\" as \"mental factors and categories,\" \"classificatory schemes,\" and \"frameworks or points of reference to be applied during contemplation\".\n\nAnālayo quotes Gyori as stating that contemplation of these \"dhammā\" \"are specifically intended to invest the mind with a soteriological orientation.\" He further quotes Gombrich as writing that contemplating these \"dhammā\" teaches one \"to see the world through Buddhist spectacles.\"\n\nIn the \"Satipatthana Sutta\" the term \"sati\" means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen. According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, \"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\" According to Vetter, \"dhyāna\" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.\n\nThe four foundations of mindfulness are one of the seven sets of \"states conducive to enlightenment\" (Pāli \"bodhipakkhiyādhammā\") identified in many schools of Buddhism as means for progressing toward \"bodhi\" (awakening). In the Noble Eightfold Path, they are included in \"sammā-sati\" and, less directly, \"sammā-samādhi\". \"Sati\" is recommended as a \"one-way path\" for the purification from unwholesome factors, and the realization of Nibbana.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, this framework for systematically cultivating mindful awareness can be found in the \"Mahasatipatthana Sutta\" (\"Greater Discourse on the Foundation of Mindfulness,\" DN 22); the \"\" (\"Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness,\" MN 10), and throughout the ' (SN, Chapter 47). The ' itself contains 104 of the Buddha's discourses on the \"\" including two popular discourses delivered to the townspeople of Sedaka, \"the Acrobat\" and \"the Beauty Queen\".\n\nThe Sutta Pitaka contains texts in which The Buddha is said to refer to the fourfold establishment of mindfulness as a \"direct\" or \"one-way path\" for purification and the realisation of nirvana.\n\nThe Chinese Tripitaka also contains two parallels to the Satipatthana sutta; Madhyama Āgama No. 26 and Ekottara Agama 12.1. The four foundations of mindfulness are also treated in various Abhidharma works in the major Buddhist traditions such as the Abhidharmakosha, the Yogacarabhumi-sastra and the Visuddhimagga.\n\nThe four establishments of mindfulness are regarded as fundamental in modern Theravadan Buddhism and the Vipassana or Insight Meditation Movement. In this approach the emphasis is on mindfulness itself, as bare attention, instead of on the objects, mental states to be guarded, and the teachings to be remembered. The four establishments () meditation practices gradually develop the mental factors of \"samatha\" (\"calm\") and vipassana (\"insight\"). Thanissaro Bhikkhu notes that \"satipatthana practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhana,\" but argues that mindfulness is also an aid in the development of concentration.\n\nBuddhadasa rejected the reliance on the \"Satipatthana sutta\" as being \"vague and muddled,\" instead relying on the \"Anapanasati Sutta\". According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact. According to Grzegorz Polak, the four \"upassanā\" have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four \"upassanā\" do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the \"jhanas\", describing how the \"samskharas\" are tranquilized:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Common ingredients include eggs, beer, butter, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt and pepper.\n\nA smaller portion, with one slice of bread and one serving of meat, is called a pony shoe.\n\nA breakfast horseshoe is also available, replacing the hamburger and French fries with sausage or bacon and hash browns The cheese sauce can also be substituted with milk gravy.\n\nRoss' Restaurant in Bettendorf, Iowa is known for a similar dish called the Magic Mountain. Instead of a hamburger patty, the sandwich contains steamed loose-meat. It has been enjoyed by politicians and celebrities including Barack Obama and Bette Midler.\n\nThe sandwich was created in the late 1920s by chef Joe Schweska at the Leland Hotel in Springfield, Illinois located on the corner of Sixth and Capitol (now an office building). The Leland Hotel, the leading hotel of Springfield, was built in 1867, and has housed hundreds of prominent Americans. The structure is five stories high and contained 235 rooms.\n\nIn the 2015 Thomas' Breakfast Battle, hosted by Thomas' Breads, Mike Murphy won a $25,000 prize for his breakfast horseshoe. The contest featured chefs from throughout the country combining local flavor with Thomas' English muffins. Murphy's winning horseshoe included eggs, bacon, cheese sauce, sausage gravy and hash browns on top of the English muffin. He prepared the dish on an episode of Fox & Friends to promote the contest. \n\n"}

The traditional Conch version uses the egg whites to make a meringue topping. The dish is named after the small Key limes (\"Citrus aurantifolia\" 'Swingle') that are naturalized throughout the Florida Keys. While their thorns make them less tractable, and their thin, yellow rinds more perishable, Key limes are more tart and more aromatic than the common Persian limes seen year-round at grocery stores in the United States. Key lime juice, unlike regular lime juice, is a pale yellow. The filling in a Key lime pie is also yellow, largely because of the egg yolks.\n\nDuring mixing, a reaction between the proteins of the egg yolks and condensed milk with the acidic lime juice occurs that causes the filling to thicken on its own without requiring baking. Early recipes for Key lime pie did not require baking the pie, relying on this chemical reaction (called thickening) to produce the proper consistency of the filling. Today, because consuming raw eggs can be dangerous, pies of this nature are usually baked for a short time. The baking also thickens the texture more than the reaction alone.\n\nThe Key lime pie has been traced back to the early 20th century in the Key West, Florida area. Its exact origins are unknown, but the first formal mention of Key lime pie as a recipe may have been made by William Curry, a ship salvager and Key West's first millionaire; his cook, \"Aunt Sally\", made the pie for him. If such is the case, however, it is also possible and maybe even probable that Sally adapted the recipe already created by local sponge fishermen. Sponge fishermen spent many contiguous days on their boats, and stored their food on board, including nutritional basics such as canned milk (which would not spoil without refrigeration), limes and eggs. Fresh milk was not a common commodity in the Florida Keys before modern refrigerated distribution methods. Sponge fishermen at sea would presumably not have access to an oven, and, similarly, the original recipe for Key lime pie did not call for cooking the mixture of lime, milk, and eggs.\n\nThe annual Key Lime Festival started in Key West, Florida in 2002. It is held every year over the July 4 weekend and is a celebration of the use of Key limes in food, drinks, and culture.\n\nIn 1965, Florida State Representative Bernie Papy, Jr., introduced legislation calling for a $100 fine to be levied against anyone advertising Key lime pie not made with Key limes. The bill failed.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate both passed legislation {HB 453} and {SB 676} selecting \"Key lime pie\" as the official pie of the state of Florida.\n\n"}

It is usually flavoured with parsley, lemon, mace, onions, ginger, and cardamom, although there are some variations. Then the mixture is stuffed into pork casings and separated into individual sausages measuring about ten to twelve centimeters in length and three to four centimeters in thickness.\n\nAs they are very perishable, \"Weißwürste\" traditionally were manufactured early in the morning and prepared and eaten as a snack between breakfast and lunch; there is a saying that the sausages should not be allowed to hear the noon chime of the church bells. Traditionally, \"Weißwürste\" may only be served until midday because preservatives are not used, the meat is not smoked, and hence the sausage is made fresh every day; indeed, they are sometimes called morning sausages. Before modern refrigeration technologies, in summertime the sausages would go bad before nightfall. Even today, most Bavarians never eat \"Weißwürste\" after lunchtime (though it is perfectly acceptable to have a lunch consisting of Weißwürste at, say, half past one).\n\nThe sausages are heated in water—well short of boiling—for about ten minutes, which will turn them greyish-white because no color-preserving nitrite is used in Weisswurst preparation.\n\n\"Weißwürste\" are brought to the table in a big bowl together with the hot water used for preparation (so they do not cool down too much), then eaten without their skins. Ways of eating \"Weißwurst\" include the traditional way, called \"zuzeln\" (Bavarian for sucking), in which each end of the sausage is cut or bitten open, then the meat is sucked out from the skin. Alternatively, the more popular and more discreet ways of consuming it are by cutting the sausage lengthwise and then \"rolling out\" the meat from the skin with a fork, or also to open it on one and consume it very much like a banana, ever opening the peel further and dipping the sausage into the mustard.\n\n\"Weißwurst\" is commonly served with a Bavarian sweet mustard (\"Weißwurstsenf\") and accompanied by Brezen (Bavarian \"Pretzel\"—often spelled \"Brezeln\" outside Bavaria) and \"Weißbier\".\n\n\"Weißwurst\", whose consumption traditionally is associated with Bavaria, helped in the coining of a humorous term, \"Weißwurstäquator\" (literally, white sausage equator), that delineates a cultural boundary separating other linguistic and cultural areas from Southern Germany.\n\nThe Weißwurst was invented 1857 at the Marienplatz in Munich.\n\n\n"}

The region encompasses the geographical area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Niger River, a large swathe of territory spanning Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Egypt, Western Sahara, and the Canary Islands.\n\nAlthough the Berber linguistic root \"MZƔ\" or \"ZƔ\" is ancient, \"Tamazɣa\" as a toponym is derived from the Berber language, coined in the context of Berber nationalism. It appeared for the first time in Algeria and Morocco in the 1970s. It is not clear at all who coined it. Some say it was Mouloud Mammeri (1917–1989). According to others, it was Kateb Yacine (1929–1989).\n\nThe most inhabited areas of the Tamazgha are the coastal fertile regions of northern Libya, northern and eastern Tunisia, northern Algeria, northern Morocco, and the Atlantic coast of Morocco. \"Tamazgha\" corresponds roughly to Herodotus' Ancient Libya and to the medieval Barbary Coast.\n\nThe term is used by the Berbers because there was not originally a common word that refers to all the geographical territory inhabited by the Mazices, since the Mazice people live in several Mazice countries, and they are not united politically, with many scattered around the World by the Mazice Diaspora. So, the name has been created to define an Mazice Nation, and unify the people of the Tamazgha with their original culture. Many philologists sort this term like neologism, built from traditional Berber (Tamazight) terms.\n\nThe term has been translated into Spanish as Mazigia, abbreviated as MZG and used as an alternative international license plate code for some people .\n"}
{"id": "555979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555979", "title": "Auto-antonym", "text": "Auto-antonym\n\nAn auto-antonym or autantonym, also called a contronym, contranymor Janus word, is a word with multiple meanings (senses) of which one is the reverse of another. For example, the word \"cleave\" can mean \"to cut apart\" or \"to bind together\". This phenomenon is called enantiosemy, enantionymy or antilogy (\"enantio-\" means \"opposite\"). An enantiosemic term is necessarily polysemic.\n\nThe terms \"autantonym\" and \"contronym\" were coined by Joseph Twadell Shipley in 1960 and Jack Herring in 1962, respectively. An auto-antonym is alternatively called an antagonym, Janus word (after the Roman god with two faces), enantiodrome, self-antonym, antilogy, or addad (Arabic, singular didd).\n\nSome pairs of contronyms are true homographs, i.e., distinct words with different etymology which happen to have the same form. For instance \"cleave\" \"separate\" is from Old English \"clēofan\", while \"cleave\" \"adhere\" is from Old English \"clifian\", which was pronounced differently. The King James Bible often uses \"let\" in the sense of \"forbid\", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb \"lettan\" 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning \"allow\", which is derived from the Old English verb \"lǣtan\" 'leave, allow, let on lease (etc.)'. Still, the alternate meaning of \"let\" can be found today in the legal phrase \"without let or hindrance\" and in ball games such as tennis, squash, table tennis, and racquetball.\n\nOther contronyms are a form of polysemy, but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, \"sanction\"—\"permit\" or \"penalize\"; \"bolt\" (originally from crossbows)—\"leave quickly\" or \"fix/immobilize\"; \"fast\"—\"moving rapidly\" or \"unmoving\". Some English examples result from nouns being verbed in the patterns of \"add <noun> to\" and \"remove <noun> from\"; e.g. \"dust\", \"seed\", \"stone\". Denotations and connotations can drift or branch over centuries. An apocryphal story relates how Charles II (or sometimes Queen Anne) described St Paul's Cathedral (using contemporaneous English) as \"awful, pompous, and artificial,\" with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of \"awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed\". Negative words such as \"bad\" and \"sick\" sometimes acquire ironic senses referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (\"that outfit is bad as hell\"; \"lyrics full of sick burns\").\n\nSome contronyms result from differences in varieties of English. For example, to \"table\" a bill means \"to put it up for debate\" in British English, while it means \"to remove it from debate\" in American English (where British English would have \"shelve\"). To \"barrack\" for anyone in Australian English is to loudly demonstrate your support, while it expresses disapproval and contempt in British English.\n\nSome words contain simultaneous opposing or competing meanings in the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include blend words such as \"coopetition\" (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition), \"frenemy\" (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy), \"interdependence\", \"glocalization\" etc. These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings.\n\nAuto-antonyms exist in many languages, as the following examples show.\n\nIn Latin, \"sacer\" has the double meaning \"sacred, holy\" and \"accursed, infamous\". Greek δημιουργός gave Latin its \"demiurgus\", from which English got its \"demiurge\", which can refer either to God as the creator or to the devil, depending on philosophical context.\n\nIn many languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so it can refer to any of the doings or persons on either side of the transaction, that is, to the action of either the subject or the object, or to either the person who does something or the person to whom (or for whom) it is done. Other cues nail down the aspects of subject versus object. Thus there is a simple logic involved, despite that discussions of such words sometimes fixate on a superficial appearance of illogic (that is, \"how can one word mean both?!\"). Examples: \n\nContemporary English has some auto-antonym adjectives that are used for evaluating: \"sick\" can mean \"ill\" or \"extremely good\"; \"bad\" can mean \"bad\" or \"excellent\"; words like \"cool\" or \"in\" may be evaluate something that is \"warm\" or \"out\", respectively (\"This new fireplace is cool.\" or \"Outdoor activities are in, now.\"). We may hear evaluations like \"pretty ugly\", \"ridiculously serious\", \"insanely rational\", \"incredibly trustworthy\", \"impossibly doable\", \"super sub-par\".\n\nAmong profanities, adjective or article decides its meaning, for example:\n\nSeeming auto-antonyms can occur from translation. In Hawaiian, for example, \"aloha\" is translated both as \"hello\" and as \"goodbye\", but the essential meaning of the word is \"love\", whether used as a greeting or farewell. The Italian greeting \"ciao\" is translated as \"hello\" or \"goodbye\" depending on the context; however, the original meaning was \"(I'm your) slave\".\n\n\n\n"}

Now, the practice is frowned upon by most collectors who collect the entire, thus saving the envelope's postal history, the knife of the envelope and the postmark. To illustrate how far things have shifted in emphasis from the collection of cut squares, the most recent UPSS publication on US 20th and 21st century stamped envelopes does not even mention cut squares, whereas its predecessor edition, just seven years earlier, devoted a section to their pricing. \nThe term \"cut square\" is differentiated from the term used on piece which denotes an adhesive stamp cut out in similar fashion from the original cover so as to preserve the entire postmark.\n\nCut-out (philately)\n"}

{"id": "560142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560142", "title": "ATASCII", "text": "ATASCII\n\nThe ATASCII character set, from ATARI Standard Code for Information Interchange\", alternatively ATARI ASCII\", is the variation on ASCII used in the Atari 8-bit family of home computers. The first of this family were the Atari 400 and 800, released in 1979, and later models were released throughout the 1980s. The last computer to use the ATASCII character set was the Atari XEGS which was released in 1987. The Atari ST family of computers used the different Atari ST character set.\n\nLike most other non-standard ASCIIs, ATASCII has its own special block graphics symbols (arrows, blocks, circles, line segments, playing card suits, etc.) corresponding to the control character locations of the standard ASCII table (characters 0–31), and a few other character locations.\n\nThe most notable difference between standard ASCII and ATASCII is the use of control characters. In standard ASCII, a character in the range 0 to 31 is construed as a command, which might move the cursor, clear the screen, end a line, and so on. Some of these were designed for use on printers and teletypes rather than on screen (to advance the paper, overtype, and so on). In ATASCII most of the ASCII control character values produce a graphics glyph instead. ATASCII uses character values different from ASCII for cursor control.\n\nATASCII has a character set of only 128 characters. If the high-order bit is set on a character (i.e., if the byte value of the character is between 128 and 255) the character is generally rendered in the reverse video (also called \"inverse video\") of its counterpart between 0 and 127, using a bitwise negation of the character's glyph. This is done by the ANTIC chip. The two exceptions to this rule are that an \"escape\" character (ATASCII and ASCII 27) with its high order bit set becomes an \"EOL\" or \"End Of Line\" character (ATASCII 155; ASCII 13), and a \"clear screen\" character (ATASCII 125) with its high order bit set becomes a \"bell\" or \"buzzer\" character (ATASCII 253; ASCII 7). No Atari printers actually have a bell, but the computer will sound if it is written to the screen device.\n\nThe ATASCII control characters used by the screen editor for cursor control (arrow keys) and text editing (tab, insert, delete, backspace, etc.) have associated graphic symbols that can be displayed by preceding them by the \"escape\" character (ATASCII 27). For example, a right arrow can be displayed on a screen or printer by preceding it with the escape character followed by the \"cursor right\" character itself (ATASCII 31).\n\nThe Atari screen editor implements the text cursor by simply inverting the character at the cursor position (by XOR with $80). It does not flash.\n\nThe differences between character representation can cause problems during modem communication between Ataris and other computers. Cursor movement commands (and even carriage returns and line feeds) from computers not using ATASCII will be nonsense on an Atari, and vice versa. Terminal programs need to translate between ATASCII and standard ASCII.\n\nSome Atari-based BBSs exploited this difference by asking the client to hit the \"Return\" key. If it got 13 (ASCII CR), then standard ASCII would be used. If it got 155 (ATASCII CR) it would switch to ATASCII, allowing full use of the ATASCII graphic set. Some Atari BBSs would also block features (or even block access completely) for non-Atari users.\n\nThe control codes in ATASCII are transmissible to other computers such as BBS's, and crude animations are possible. These animations, also known as \"break movies\", often take the form of short cartoons, and were a popular feature of Atari BBSs in its heyday.\n\nBecause cursor control operations are represented with a single character (as opposed to multi-byte 'escape' sequences that were common in other schemes, like ANSI or VT100), it is quite easy to make these animations. They can be created by a short BASIC program that captures keyboard commands, echoes them to the screen and saves them to a file. The Atari also allowed commands to be typed and captured as part of its operating system. Of course this required care to get it right, but after a few attempts it normally became quite easy. The simple capture programs didn't have editing features, so ATASCII movies frequently had errors that were corrected by repositioning the cursor and printing over the mistake (a computer version of correction fluid).\n\nThe following table shows the glyphs for ATASCII characters and the corresponding Unicode glyph. Characters without a corresponding Unicode glyph are represented by abbreviations for their names.\n\nNote the asymmetry in the selection of graphics characters: There are lower triangles but no upper triangles, a left half block but no right half block, and a lower half block but no upper half block. These missing characters could be displayed by using inverse video.\n\nThe glyph representation in ROM used by ANTIC for display are assigned in different order from ASCII/ATASCII. For example, to display the characters \"@ABC\" on screen by writing directly to the screen memory, one would write the decimal values 32, 33, 34, and 35 rather than the ASCII/ATASCII values 64, 65, 66, and 67.\n\n\n\n"}

It may be served as a hot porridge, or it may be allowed to cool and solidify into a loaf that can be baked, fried, or grilled.\n\nThe variety of cereal used is usually yellow maize, but often buckwheat, white maize, or mixtures thereof may be used. Coarse grinds make a firm, coarse polenta; finer grinds make a creamy, soft polenta. Polenta is a staple of Northern Italian, Swiss, Slovenian and Croatian (where it is called palenta) cuisines (and, to a lesser extent, the Central Italian one, e.g. Tuscany) and its consumption was traditionally associated with lower classes, as in times past cornmeal mush was an essential food in their everyday nutrition.\n\nAs it is known today, polenta derives from earlier forms of grain mush (known as \"puls\" or \"pulmentum\" in Latin) that were commonly eaten since Roman times. Before the introduction of corn (maize) from America in the 16th century, polenta was made from starchy ingredients like farro (wheat), chestnut flour, millet, spelt (wheat), and chickpeas.\n\nLatin \"polenta\" covered any hulled and crushed grain, especially barley-meal, and is derived from the Latin \"pollen\" for \"fine flour\", which shares a root with \"pulvis\", meaning \"dust\".\n\nPolenta takes a long time to cook, simmering in four to five times its volume of watery liquid for about 45 minutes with near-constant stirring; this is necessary for even gelatinization of the starch. Some alternative cooking techniques have been invented to speed up the process, or to not require constant supervision. Quick-cooking (pre-cooked, instant) polenta is widely used and is prepared in just a few minutes; it is considered inferior to polenta made from unprocessed cornmeal and is best eaten after being baked or fried.\n\nIn his book \"Heat\", Bill Buford talks about his experiences as a line cook in Mario Batali's Italian restaurant Babbo. Buford details the differences in taste between instant polenta and slow-cooked polenta, and describes a method of preparation that takes up to three hours, but does not require constant stirring: \"polenta, for most of its cooking, is left unattended... If you don't have to stir it all the time, you can cook it for hours—what does it matter, as long as you're nearby?\" \"Cook's Illustrated\" magazine has described a method using a microwave oven that reduces cooking time to 12 minutes and requires only a single stirring. In March 2010, it presented a stovetop, near-stir-less method that uses a pinch of baking soda (an alkali), which replicates the traditional effect. Kyle Phillips suggested making it in a polenta maker or in a slow cooker.\n\n"}

However, that name has fallen into disuse and they are now almost invariably labelled \"Pontefract cakes\". The term \"cake\" has a long history. The word itself is of Germanic origin, from the Germanic \"kakâ\" (cook).\n\nThe exact origins of liquorice growing in England remain uncertain. However, by the 16th century there is record of the activity, possibly via monastic gardens and as a garden crop for the gentry. During the 17th century it was recorded as being grown in areas with alluvial soil overlying magnesian limestone such as in Surrey, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Camden's Britannia of 1637 noted the crop in Worksop and Pontefract. By 1780 liquorice growing was concentrated almost wholly in Pontefract and in Surrey, around Godalming.\n\nIn Pontefract the growing of liquorice was done on plots of land behind people's houses. In a map of the 1648 Siege of Pontefract (reproduced in Chartres) the liquorice is indicated as being grown in \"garths\" either side of Micklegate, the street which runs between Pontefract's Market Place and the castle.\n\nIn the 18th century liquorice was used as a medicine both for humans and for horses. The Pontefract cake \"was almost certainly a black cake, the portable lozenge used to make 'liquorish water', stamped with the castle lodge emblem of Pontefract to signify quality. This trade mark had been employed on Pontefract cakes since 1612, when the initials 'GS' were used, and are thought to be those of Sir George Savile, major local landowner; and a second die-stamp from 1720.\" It was only in the 19th century that it was used extensively for confectionery. Of the merchants in the 18th century George Dunhill (later bought by German confectioner Haribo) was the most important. He was also a grower of liquorice.\n\nWith the growth of Pontefract cakes as confectionery the demand for liquorice outstripped the capacity of Pontefract growers to supply. By the late 19th century the twelve firms producing liquorice confectionery relied mainly on extract imported largely from Turkey.\n\nOriginally, the sweets were embossed by hand with a stamp, to form their traditional look (the workers who did this were known as \"cakers\" and were able to produce upwards of 30,000 per day), but now they are usually machinery formed. The embossed stamp was originally a stylised image of Pontefract Castle with a raven on the top bar, which is thought to have been in use for almost 400 years. When the first secret ballot in the United Kingdom was held in Pontefract on 15 August 1872, the ballot box used was sealed using a Pontefract cake stamp from Frank Dunhill’s factory, which shows the image of a castle and an owl.\n\nHealthcare professionals have warned against overindulgence in Pontefract cake after a 56-year-old woman was admitted to hospital following an overdose. The woman consumed about 200g daily, leading to dangerously low potassium levels and subsequent muscle failure. The European Commission recommends limiting consumption of the active ingredient, glycyrrhizic acid, to 100 mg or less per day.\n\nIn Elizabeth Gaskell’s 1866 novel \"Wives and Daughters\", Mr Gibson, the local doctor and one of the main characters, says in discussion with the father of one of his apprentices:\n\n“Must my boy make the pills himself then?” asked the major ruefully.\n\n“To be sure. The youngest apprentice always does. It’s not hard work. He’ll have the comfort of thinking he won’t have to swallow them himself. And he’ll have the run of the pomfret cakes, and the conserve of hips, and on Sundays he shall have a taste of tamarinds to reward him for his weekly labour at pill making.”\n"}

The beef can be processed into \"debris\" by cutting it to shreds when done (folklore says that a po' boy roast is done when it \"falls apart with a hard stare\") and simmering the shredded beef in the pot for a longer time to absorb more of the juice and seasoning.\n\nToday traditional po' boy shops offer gumbos, bisques, jambalaya, crawfish kickers and boudin, a Cajun sausage.\n\nIn the late 1800s fried oyster sandwiches on French loaves were known in New Orleans as \"oyster loaves\", a term still in use in the 21st century. A sandwich containing both fried shrimp and fried oysters is often called a \"peacemaker\" or .\n\nThe origin of the name is unknown. A popular local theory claims that \"po' boy\", as specifically referring to a type of sandwich, was coined in a New Orleans restaurant owned by Benny and Clovis Martin (originally from Raceland, Louisiana), former streetcar conductors. In 1929, during a four-month strike against the streetcar company, the Martin brothers served their former colleagues free sandwiches. The Martins' restaurant workers jokingly referred to the strikers as \"poor boys\", and soon the sandwiches themselves took on the name. In Louisiana dialect, this is naturally shortened to \"po' boy.\"\n\nOne New Orleans historian finds the Martin claim suspicious for several reasons, starting with the fact that it wasn't described by the local press until 40 years after the strike, and that prior to 1969 the story from the Martin brothers themselves was that they had created the po-boy for farmers, dock workers and other \"poor boys\" who frequented their original location near the French Market. (The Martin brothers did write a letter, reprinted in local newspapers in 1929, promising to feed the streetcar workers, but it referenced \"our meal\" and made no mention of sandwiches.)\n\nNew Orleans is known for its grand restaurants (see Louisiana Creole cuisine), but more humble fare like the po' boy is very popular. Po' boys may be made at home, sold pre-packaged in convenience stores, available at deli counters and most neighborhood restaurants. One of the most basic New Orleans restaurants is the po' boy shop, and these shops often offer seafood platters, red beans and rice, jambalaya, and other basic Creole dishes.\n\nThe two primary sources of po'boy bread are the Leidenheimer Baking Company and Alois J. Binder. There is fierce competition between po' boy shops, and resident opinions of the best po' boy shop varies widely.\n\nEach year there is a festival in New Orleans dedicated to the po' boy, the Oak Street Po'Boy Festival. It is a one-day festival that features live music, arts, and food vendors with multiple types of po' boys. It is held in mid-November along a commercial strip of Oak Street in the city's Carrollton neighborhood. The festival gives \"best-of\" awards, which gives the chefs an incentive to invent some of the most creative po' boys.\n\nAuthentic versions of Louisiana-style po' boys can be found along the Gulf Coast, from Houston through the Florida Panhandle. The term \"po' boy\" has spread further and can be found in the South Atlantic States and in California, where it may instead refer to local variations on the submarine sandwich.\n\n\n"}

It is the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God, thus used for introducing spirituality. This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.\n\n\"Simran\" is a commonly used term as a verb in Gurmukhi, which refers to 'meditating' of the Nām, the ultimate feeling of Ultimate. Sikhism is a distinct contemporary faith, whereby the Realization of God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals that have recently become the business of avaricious priests and that would impede the pure search for truth in Sikhism.\n\nIt says in the Guru Granth Sahib that through Simran one is purified and attains salvation or 'mukti'. This is because 'si-mar' means 'to die over', thus indicating to death of ego, allowing truth ultimate truth or sat to appear.\n\nOn page 202 of the Guru Granth Sahib, Guruji writes:\n\nThis hymn teaches a person who wishes to gain from this human life, one must attain a higher spiritual state by become free of attachment by realizing that all that is, is empty. Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and ultimate truth to the person who earnestly seeks it:\n\nGuru Ram Das says in \"Sarang ki var\" (Guru Granth Sahib, 1242):\n\nIn Sant Mat the word Simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it, however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due to breaking out of monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only till the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.\n\n"}

It is made with red meat, traditionally lamb or goat. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. \n\nA number of origins of the name have been suggested. \"Roughan\" means \"clarified butter\" or \"oil\" in Persian and Urdu, while \"juš\" (alternatively romanised \"josh\") means to \"stew\" or \"braise\" and ultimately derives from the verb \"jušidan\" meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".\n\nAn alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the Urdu word \"roghan\" (), \"brown\" or \"red\", or the Kashmiri \"roghan\", \"red\", along with the word either for \"meat\", (\"gošt\") often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\", or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\". The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.\n\nRogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the \"wazwan\"). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.\n\nRogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (cloves, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yogurt. After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow cooking technique. Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of \"Alkanna tinctoria\" (\"ratan jot\") and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chilies (\"lal mirch\"). These chilies, whose flavor approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried cayenne pepper of Indian cuisine. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes.\n\nThere are significant differences in preparation between the Hindu and Muslim dishes in Kashmir: Muslims use \"praan\", a local form of shallot and petals of \"maval\", the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \"cooling\" effect); Hindus eschew these, along with garlic and onions, but may add yogurt to give additional body and flavour.\n\nAlthough the dish is from Jammu & Kashmir, it is a staple in British curry houses, whose menu is partly Bangladeshi cuisine, and is an example of dishes from the Subcontinent that got \"co-opted\" once they left the area (dosa as prepared in Glasgow is cited as a prime example).\n\nWhile the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.\n\nMany western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included. However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes, while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.\n\nIn India, rogan josh is often made with goat instead of mutton, since genuine lamb is less widely available than goat meat. There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.\n"}

In the \"Oxford Companion to Food\" by Alan Davidson, it is claimed the earliest reference to \"Bakewell pudding\" comes from \"The Cook and Housewife's Manual\" by Margaret Dods and published in 1826. This is, however, erroneous as no recipe for \"Bakewell pudding\" (or indeed Bakewell tart) appears in the 1826 edition. A recipe for \"bakewell pudding\" does, however, appear in the 1847 edition. One of the earliest verifiable examples of a Bakewell pudding recipe comes from \"The Magazine of Domestic Economy\" issued in London in 1836. Eliza Acton published a recipe in her 1845 work \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\" and Mrs Beeton published two recipes for Bakewell pudding, one which used a pastry base and one which used breadcrumbs, in her book \"The Book of Household Management\" in 1861.\n\nThe pudding originated in the Derbyshire town of Bakewell. The origins of the pudding are not clear, but a common story is that it was first made by accident in 1820 (other sources cite 1860) by Mrs Greaves, who was the landlady of the White Horse Inn (since demolished). She supposedly left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart. The cook, instead of stirring the eggs and almond paste mixture into the pastry, spread it on top of the jam. When cooked, the egg and almond paste set like an egg custard, and the result was successful enough for it to become a popular dish at the inn.\n\nThe dates and/or premises given in this story are unlikely to be accurate as the White Horse Inn was demolished in 1803 to make way for the development of Rutland Square and subsequently the Rutland Arms Hotel. Additionally, Eliza Acton provides a recipe for 'Bakewell pudding' in her book \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\" which was published in 1845, making the pudding's creation date of 1860 impossible.\n\n"}

Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid; this process is called condensation. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled at about −13°C (8°F) for 5–6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles). In above freezing temperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400% before the droplets could form.\n\nThe concept of cloud condensation nuclei is used in cloud seeding, that tries to encourage rainfall by seeding the air with condensation nuclei. It has further been suggested that creating such nuclei could be used for marine cloud brightening, a climate engineering technique.\n\nA typical raindrop is about 2 mm in diameter, a typical cloud droplet is on the order of 0.02 mm, and a typical cloud condensation nucleus (aerosol) is on the order of 0.0001 mm or 0.1 µm or greater in diameter. The number of cloud condensation nuclei in the air can be measured and ranges between around 100 to 1000 per cubic centimetre. The total mass of CCNs injected into the atmosphere has been estimated at 2x10 kg over a year's time.\n\nThere are many different types of atmospheric particulates that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more complicated by the fact that many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as ice nuclei in colder parts of the atmosphere.\n\nThe number and type of CCNs can affect the precipitation amount, lifetimes and radiative properties of clouds as well as the amount and hence have an influence on climate change; details are not well understood but are the subject of research. There is also speculation that solar variation may affect cloud properties via CCNs, and hence affect climate.\n\nSulfate aerosol (SO and methanesulfonic acid droplets) act as CCNs. These sulfate aerosols form partly from the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) produced by phytoplankton in the open ocean. Large algal blooms in ocean surface waters occur in a wide range of latitudes and contribute considerable DMS into the atmosphere to act as nuclei. The idea that an increase in global temperature would also increase phytoplankton activity and therefore CCN numbers was seen as a possible natural phenomenon that would counteract climate change. An increase of phytoplankton has been observed by scientists in certain areas but the causes are unclear.\n\nA counter-hypothesis is advanced in \"The Revenge of Gaia\", the book by James Lovelock. Warming oceans are likely to become stratified, with most ocean nutrients trapped in the cold bottom layers while most of the light needed for photosynthesis in the warm top layer. Under this scenario, deprived of nutrients, marine phytoplankton would decline, as would sulfate cloud condensation nuclei, and the high albedo associated with low clouds. This is known as the CLAW hypothesis (named after the authors' initials of a 1987 \"Nature\" paper) but no conclusive evidence to support this has yet been reported.\n\n\n"}

It is usually kept at a warmer temperature compared to ice cream, and typically has a denser consistency.\n\nEgg yolks have been integrated into ice creams since at least the 1690s, though there are several notable invention stories that are associated with modern commercializations of this practice.\n\nOne early commercialization of frozen custard was in Coney Island, New York in 1919, when ice cream vendors Archie and Elton Kohr found that adding egg yolks to ice cream created a smoother texture and helped the ice cream stay cold longer. In their first weekend on the boardwalk, they sold 18,460 cones.\n\nA frozen custard stand at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago introduced the dessert to a wider audience. Following the fair, the dessert's popularity spread throughout the Midwest; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in particular, became known as the \"unofficial frozen custard capital of the world\".\n\nPer capita, Milwaukee has the highest concentration of frozen custard shops in the world and the city supports a long-standing three-way competition between Kopp's Frozen Custard, Gilles Frozen Custard and Leon's Frozen Custard.\n\nFrozen custard chains in the United States include Culver's, headquartered in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, with outlets in 20 states; Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers, based in Wichita, Kansas, with more than 300 locations nationwide; Andy's Frozen Custard, based in Springfield, Missouri, with over 70 locations in 13 states; Ted Drewes Frozen Custard in St. Louis, Rita’s in Southern California and Abbott's Frozen Custard, in Rochester, New York.\n\nIn the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration requires products marketed as frozen custard to contain at least 10 percent milkfat and 1.4 percent egg yolk solids. If it has a smaller percentage of egg yolk solids, it is considered ice cream.\n\nTrue frozen custard is a very dense dessert. Soft serve ice creams may have an overrun as large as 100%, meaning half of the final product is composed of air. Frozen custard, when made in a continuous freezer will have an overrun of 15–30% depending on the machine manufacturer (an overrun percentage similar to gelato). Air is not pumped into the mix, nor is it added as an \"ingredient\" but gets into the frozen state by the agitation of liquid similar to whisking a meringue. The high percentage of butterfat and egg yolk gives frozen custard a thick, creamy texture and a smoother consistency than ice cream. Frozen custard can be served at −8 °C (18 °F), warmer than the −12 °C (10 °F) at which ice cream is served, in order to make a soft serve product.\n\nAnother difference between commercially produced frozen custard and commercial ice cream is the way the custard is frozen. The mix enters a refrigerated tube and, as it freezes, blades scrape the product cream off the barrel walls. The now frozen custard is discharged directly into containers from which it can be served. The speed with which the product leaves the barrel minimizes the amount of air in the product but more importantly ensures that the ice crystals formed are very small.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "568048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568048", "title": "Fighting in ice hockey", "text": "Fighting in ice hockey\n\nFighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history that involves many levels of amateur and professional play and includes some notable individual fights. Fighting is usually performed by enforcers, or \"goons\"—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team, and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, coaches, officials, and the media refer to as \"the code\". Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights.\n\nUnique among North American professional team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.\n\nPhysical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as checking and prohibited techniques such as elbowing, high-sticking, and cross-checking, is linked to fighting. Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights. Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates. The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or \"heavyweights\") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential. Most fans and players oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games, but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.\n\nFighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or \"fisticuffs\" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a five-minute major penalty. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America. Promoters such as Tex Rickard of Madison Square Garden, who also promoted boxing events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.\n\nIn the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to \"fisticuffs\" has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 46 in the NHL rulebook. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants. Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.\n\nAlthough fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s, it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it \"was probably more like rugby on skates than it was modern hockey.\" Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the Original Six era, when fewer teams existed than in later years. However, as the NHL's expansion in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common. Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention. In an NHL preseason game between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues in 1969, Bruins defenceman Ted Green and Blues left wing Wayne Maki, attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture. In 1978, World Hockey Association Birmingham Bulls enforcer Dave Hanson, known for his 11-year professional career, fought Hall of Famer Bobby Hull and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles. The incident landed Hanson in the news, and irate Winnipeg fans attempted to assault him on his way out of the arena. Hanson appeared in the 1977 movie \"Slap Shot\", a comedy about hockey violence.\n\nThe rise of the \"\" in the 1973–74 and 1974–75 Philadelphia Flyers served as an example for future NHL enforcers. The average number of fights per game rose above 1.0 during the 1980s, peaking at 1.17 in 1983–84. That season, a bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoff matchup between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 11 players were ejected. This game is commonly referred to as the \"Good Friday Massacre\".\n\nMany teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars. Fights in the 1990s included the Brawl in Hockeytown in 1997, in which the Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and Claude Lemieux and goalies Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders Chris Osgood and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties. In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – Ottawa Senators game resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie Robert Esche and Senators goalie Patrick Lalime. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches. The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.\n\nBy 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.\n\nSince the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the \"Third Man In\" rule which attempts to eliminate the bench-clearing brawl by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight. Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift. In 1992, the \"Instigator\" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight, was introduced.\n\nRules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.\n\nThe rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also \"drop\" or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games. In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.\n\nIn the NHL, American Hockey League (AHL), ECHL, Southern Professional Hockey League, and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase \"five for fighting\"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.\n\nA player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.\n\nIn Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.\n\nFighting is strictly prohibited in European professional hockey leagues and in Olympic ice hockey. The international rules (by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)) specify in rule 141 – \"Fighting\" the following penalties (among others):\n\nDespite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the Nottingham Panthers and the Sheffield Steelers in the British Superleague saw \"some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink\". When Sheffield enforcer Dennis Vial crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer Barry Nieckar subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers' coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines. Russia's Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between Vityaz Chekhov and Avangard Omsk in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.\n\nThe Punch-up in Piestany was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.\n\nThe role of \"enforcer\" on a hockey team is unofficial. Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team. Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the pest, who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).\n\nThere are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw \"reaction penalties\", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers. Fights often start in response to an opponent's rough play.\n\nOf the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation. When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.\n\nEnforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.\n\nIntimidation is an important element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.\n\nFor teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games. Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose. Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a \"reaction penalty\", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.\n\nAnother reason is the protection of star players. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.\n\nMany young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.\n\nThere are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason. A rivalry that produced many fights was between the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s.\n\nStatistics indicate that fights are detrimental to teams' play, or have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about 1/80th of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.\n\nThe Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in \"Position Statement\" in 1988 that \"Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game.\"\n\nCriticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.\n\nSports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a \"knee-jerk\" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, and that it is simply a waste of time. The \"Journal of Sport and Social Issues\"' Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.\n\nVarious politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada, said that fighting should not be part of the sport. IIHF president Rene Fasel has protested against fighting, deeming it \"Neanderthal behavior.\" Wayne Gretzky, considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fisticuffs, although he expressed support for fighting in 2004.\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, \"Fighting has always had a role in the game ... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game.\"\n\nCommunity members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a school board trustee in London, Ontario attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it. This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the Ontario Hockey League, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its Medical Health Officer, the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.\n\nThe first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.\n\nFighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.\n\nBeginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League imposed a fighting major counter, similar to the National Basketball Association's unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer's accumulated cards. A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors). A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting. If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension.\n\nThere are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.\n\nEnforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a \"free pass\". Enforcer Darren McCarty described fighters as being divided into \"heavyweights\" and \"light heavyweights\", and said that players in the former category \"end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch.\"\n\nLong-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.\n\nAnother important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks, and not assaulting referees or linesmen. Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.\n\nSportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.\n\nFighting tactics are governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as \"going for it\", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.\n\nOther examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time Buffalo Sabres enforcer Rob Ray to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps (\"fight straps\") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the \"Rob Ray Rule\".\n\nThroughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc. Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by \"common sense\", according to officials.\nIn a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together. If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.\n\nIn a multiple fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a \"riot pad\"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.\n\n"}

Canned fabada is sold in most supermarkets across the country.\n\nFabada is a hot and heavy dish and for that reason is most commonly eaten during winter and at the largest meal of the day, lunch. It is usually served as a starter, but may also be the main course of the meal. It is typically served with Asturian cider or a red wine.\n\nFabada is made with dried large white beans (\"fabes de la Granja\", soaked overnight before use), shoulder of pork (\"lacón\") or bacon (\"tocino\"), black pudding (\"morcilla\"), chorizo, and often saffron (\"azafrán\"). Some recipes also call for longaniza.\n\nThe Spanish olla podrida and southern French cassoulet are both similar to fabada asturiana. \n\n"}

Recipes for Bosanski lonac vary greatly according to personal and regional preference, but the main ingredients generally include chunked meat and vegetables. Mixed meats may be used in the dish. It has been described as a national dish of Bosnia.\n\nBosanski lonac has been on tables of both the rich and the poor for hundreds of years. The wealthy prepared the dish with more meat and other expensive ingredients, while the poor used what was available. Typical ingredients are: beef, lamb, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, parsley, garlic, peppercorns (whole, not ground). Many different vegetables or meats may be used. Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full) into a deep pot, then adding 1 - 2 dl water. The ingredients are usually cut into large pieces rather than finely chopped or minced.\n\nOriginally, Bosanski lonac was made in ceramic pots and cooked in a fireplace or pit in the ground. Today, with the declining availability of fireplaces for cooking, many cooks use a regular pot and a kitchen stove. Due to the preference for large chunks of meat and vegetables, the meal takes about 4 hours to cook.\n\n\n"}

Crispbreads are light and keep fresh for a very long time. Crispbread is a staple food and was for a long time considered a poor man's diet. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in crispbread in the Nordic countries.\n\nCrispbread has been baked in central Sweden since 500 AD (CE). It was made as round wafers with a hole in the middle so the bread could be stored on sticks under the roof. Traditional crispbread was invented about 500 years ago. Finland and Sweden have long traditions in crispbread consumption, and crispbread has been known in most households since the 1800s. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year; following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow. Traditional western Finnish crispbread was (and still is) made in the form of a round flat loaf with a hole in the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. Sweden's first industrial crispbread bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850. Rectangular \"Knäckebrot\" was first manufactured in Germany in 1927 and has remained popular and readily available there ever since.\n\nCrispbread traditionally consists of wholemeal rye flour, salt, and water. Today, however, many kinds of crispbread contain wheat flour, spices and grains, and is often leavened with yeast or sourdough, and milk or sesame seeds can be added.\n\nIn the case of unleavened crispbread, bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically. Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking. Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is cooled and mixed until bubbly.\n\nAnother method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough.\n\nCrispbread is only baked for a few minutes, at temperatures usually between 200 and 250 °C.\n"}
{"id": "574518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=574518", "title": "Ground beef", "text": "Ground beef\n\nGround beef, minced beef or beef mince is beef that has been finely chopped with a knife or a meat grinder (American English) or mincing machine (British English). It is used in many recipes including hamburgers and spaghetti Bolognese.\n\nIt is not to be confused with a mixture of chopped dried fruit, distilled spirits and spices referred to as \"mincemeat\". \n\nIn many countries, food laws define specific categories of ground beef and what they can contain. For example, in the United States, beef fat may be added to hamburger but not to ground beef if the meat is ground and packaged at a USDA-inspected plant. In the U.S., a maximum of 30% fat by weight is allowed in either hamburger or ground beef. The allowable amount in France is 5 to 20% (15% being used by most food chains). In Germany, regular ground beef may contain up to 15% fat while the special \"Tatar\" for \"steak tartare\" may contain less than 5% fat. Both hamburger and ground beef can have added seasoning, phosphate, extenders, or binders added; but no additional water is permitted. Ground beef is often marketed in a range of different fat contents to match the preferences of customers.\n\nGround beef is generally made from the less tender and less popular cuts of beef. Trimmings from tender cuts may also be used.\n\nIn a study in the U.S. in 2008, eight brands of fast food hamburgers were evaluated for recognizable tissue types using morphological techniques that are commonly used in the evaluation of tissue's histological condition. The study of the eight laboratory specimens found the content of the hamburgers included:\n\nGround beef in the United States may contain a meat-based product used as a food additive produced using technology known as advanced meat recovery systems. Meat processing methods used by companies such as Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) and Cargill Meat Solutions produce lean, finely textured beef product, otherwise known as \"pink slime\", from fatty beef trimmings. This meat-based product is then treated with antimicrobial agents to remove salmonella and other pathogens, and is included in a variety of ground beef products in the U.S. From 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved the product for limited human consumption. In a 2009 article by \"The New York Times\", the safety of the beef processing method used by BPI was questioned. After the USDA's approval, this product became a component in ground beef used by McDonald's, Burger King and many other fast-food chains as well as grocery chains in the U.S. \n\nIn government and industry records in testing for the school lunch program, pathogens such as \"E. coli\" and salmonella were found dozens of times in meat from BPI, which raises questions about safety of the meat product and the effectiveness of the antimicrobial method used in meat recovery system of the company. Between 2005 and 2009, \"E. coli\" was found three times and salmonella 48 times. BPI had a rate of 36 positives for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared to a rate of nine positives per 1,000 tests for other suppliers for the program. However, the program continued to source from BPI because its price was substantially lower than ordinary meat trimmings, saving about $1m a year for the program.\nCargill, among the largest hamburger makers in the U.S., is a big buyer of the meat-based product from BPI for its patties, according to the Times. It suspended buying meat from two plants owned by BPI for several months in 2006 after excessive levels of salmonella were found.\n\nAlthough any cut of beef can be used to produce ground beef, chuck steak is a popular choice because of its rich flavor and balance of meat-to-fat ratio. Round steak is also often used. Ground beef is usually categorized based on the cut and fat percentage:\n\n\nGround beef is popular as a relatively cheap and quick-cooking form of beef. Some of its best-known uses are in hamburgers, sausages and cottage pies. It is an important ingredient in meatloaf, sloppy joes, tacos, and Midwestern cuisine. Italians use it to make meat sauces, for example, lasagna and spaghetti bolognese. In the Middle East, it is used to make spicy kofta and meatballs. The Scottish dish mince and tatties uses it with mashed or boiled potatoes. In Lancashire, particularly Oldham, minced meat is a common filling for rag pudding. The Dutch slavink consists of ground beef (half beef, half pork) rolled in bacon. Picadillo is a Spanish term for ground beef, and is a common ingredient in several Latin American cuisines. Picadillo with chili pepper and finely diced onion and potato is a common filling for tacos and gorditas in Mexico.\n\nRaw, lean, ground beef is used to make steak tartare, a French dish. More finely diced and differently seasoned, it is popular as a main course and as a dressing in Belgium, where it is known as filet américain (\"American fillet\").\n\nFood safety of ground meat issues occur because of the possibility of bacterial contamination. Undercooked hamburgers contaminated with were responsible for four deaths and the illness of hundreds of people in the U.S. in 1993. Ground beef must be cooked to 72 °C (160 °F) to ensure all bacterial contamination—whether it be endogenous to the product or contaminated after purchasing by the consumer—is killed. The color of cooked meat does not always indicate the beef has reached the required temperature; beef can brown before reaching 68 °C (155 °F).\n\nTo ensure the safety of food distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, and other federal food and nutrition programs, the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef it purchases. A 2010 National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department's ground beef safety standards, compared the standards to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and examined ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program. The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of foodborne diseases will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.\n\nThe 2013 horse meat scandal (Horsemeatgate) found traces of horsemeat in many UK and European foods and ready meals which were labelled as being Minced/Ground beef products mostly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "575030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575030", "title": "Crystal Pepsi", "text": "Crystal Pepsi\n\nCrystal Pepsi is a soft drink made by PepsiCo. It was first sold in Europe in the early 1990s. The United States and Canada received it from 1992 to 1994, with brief rereleases throughout the mid-2010s. It was briefly sold in the UK and Australia. The product's original market life was sabotaged by competitor Coca-Cola, in a \"kamikaze\" plan which sacrificed its Tab Clear product in order to end them both. Crystal Pepsi is notable for a fanatical revival by the public decades later, leading to a corporate response with these re-releases.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a marketing fad called the Clear Craze equated clarity with purity. This began with the remake of Ivory soap, whose marketing slogan had already been \"99 and 44/100 percent pure\", from its classic milky solution. The \"clear\" idea spread to many companies and product types including PepsiCo's development of a clear cola. Crystal Pepsi was marketed as a caffeine-free \"clear alternative\" to normal colas. Its marketing slogan was \"You've never seen a taste like this\".\n\nOn April 13, 1992, PepsiCo introduced Crystal Pepsi to test markets in Denver, Sacramento, Dallas, Providence, and Grand Rapids, and the product generated a positive response. Pleased with the results, PepsiCo began to sell the cola nationwide in December of that year.\n\nIn its first year, Crystal Pepsi captured a full percentage point of U.S. soft drink sales, approximately $474 million. Coca-Cola followed suit by launching Tab Clear on December 14, 1992. That company's previous clear cola had been a secret one-off made as a particular political favor between Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Soviet Union in the 1940s, to disguise the American beverage as vodka, and was named White Coke. \n\nBy late 1993, Pepsi pulled the drink off the market, and the final batches were delivered to retailers during the first few months of 1994. Pepsi returned several months later with a reformulated citrus-cola hybrid called \"Crystal From Pepsi\", but that was short-lived as well.\n\nAccording to Coca-Cola's chief marketing officer, Sergio Zyman, Tab Clear was an intentionally \"kamikaze\" effort to create an unpopular beverage that was positioned as an analogue of Crystal Pepsi in order to \"kill both in the process\". The \"born to die\" strategy included using the poor-performing Tab brand rather than Coke, labeling the product as a \"sugar free\" diet drink to confuse consumers into thinking Crystal Pepsi had no sugar, and marketing the product as if it were \"medicinal\". Zyman said \"Pepsi spent an enormous amount of money on the brand and, regardless, we killed it. Both of them were dead within six months.\"\n\nA large marketing campaign was launched, for which the company invented the world's first photo-realistic, computer-generated bus wrap printing. A series of television advertisements featuring Van Halen's hit song \"Right Now\" premiered on national television on January 31, 1993, during Super Bowl XXVII. This commercial was parodied by \"Saturday Night Live\" with their \"Crystal Gravy\" commercial. Full-sized sample bottles were distributed with the Sunday paper deliveries such as the \"Boston Globe\" in Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2005, a new clear Pepsi was sold in Mexico as Pepsi Clear for a limited time. On August 22, 2008, PepsiCo filed for trademarks on the product names \"Pepsi Clear\" and \"Diet Pepsi Clear\".\n\nYum! Brands Chairman David C. Novak is credited with introducing the Crystal Pepsi concept. In a December 2007 interview, he stated this:\n\nIn September 2014, following a Facebook campaign by consumers, The Coca-Cola Company reintroduced the soft drink Surge, leading to speculation in the public and amongst media about the return of Crystal Pepsi.\n\nIn March 2015, an online campaign to bring back Crystal Pepsi began. The following month, a second and completely separate petition was led by an online competitive eating personality, Kevin Strahle, also known as The L.A. Beast, who made a 2013 viral video of himself drinking a 1990s vintage bottle of Crystal Pepsi. This generated enough interest for a telephone and email campaign, garnering around 37,000 Change.org petition signatures, tens of thousands of Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram tagged comments, 15 billboards erected around the Los Angeles area, and a commitment to ride a mobile billboard truck at Pepsi's headquarters in Purchase, New York with a gathering of supporters at a park nearby on June 15 and 16, 2015. The interest from this campaign led to an official response by PepsiCo. on June 8, 2015: \"We've had customers ask us to bring back their favorite products before, but never with your level of enthusiasm and humor. We're lucky to have a Pepsi superfan like you on our side. We definitely hear you and your followers and we think you'll all be happy with what's in store. Stay tuned.\"\n\nIn November 2015, Pepsi hinted on its Twitter page that the beverage would make a comeback. In December 2015, Pepsi announced that fans of the drink could win one of 13,000 six-packs of the beverage by entering a sweepstakes via a mobile application or online at Pepsipass.com between December 10 and 11. Winners selected during the following week would receive the beverage in time for Christmas.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Pepsi announced that the drink would be making a second return, reaching Canadian stores on July 11, and American stores on August 8, 2016. Unlike the original release in the 1990s, the drink as released in 2015 and 2016 contains caffeine and sodium benzoate, a preservative.\n\nIn October 2016, Pepsi rereleased the drink in the United States again for a limited time exclusively on Amazon.com through its Prime Pantry service, sold in 8 packs. On November 1, 2016, Pepsi announced that the drink would be making a third return for 2017. On July 19, \"People\" magazine released an article stating that Crystal Pepsi would be back for what was claimed as being the final time the drink would be rereleased, on August 14, and that Crystal Pepsi-themed music festivals would be held at baseball stadiums around the US with performers Busta Rhymes and Salt-n-Pepa.\n\nThe drink was re-released in August 2018, once again being claimed as being the \"last chance\" to purchase the drink. Unlike previous re-releases which occurred in both the United States and Canada, the 2018 re-release was exclusive to the United States.\n\nIn March 2019, the drink was re-released in Canadian stores for a limited time.\n\n"}
{"id": "575131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575131", "title": "Raw milk", "text": "Raw milk\n\nRaw milk or unpasteurized milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, a process of heating liquid foods to decontaminate them for safe drinking. Proponents of raw milk have stated that there are benefits to its consumption, including better flavor, better nutrition, and the building of a healthy immune system. However, the medical community has warned of the dangers, which include a risk of infection, and has not found any clear benefit. The availability and regulation of raw milk vary around the world. In the US, some dairies have adopted low-temperature vat pasteurization, which they say produces a product similar to raw milk.\n\nHumans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 9000–7000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000 BC in the Americas. The most important dairy animals—cattle, sheep and goats—were first domesticated in Mesopotamia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. From there dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but not reaching Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC).\n\nPasteurization is widely used to prevent infected milk from entering the food supply. The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage.\n\nAfter sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s. This move successfully controlled the spread of highly contagious bacterial diseases including \"E. coli\", bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis (all thought to be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk). In the early days after the scientific discovery of bacteria, there was no product testing to determine whether a farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk was treated as potentially contagious. After the first tests were developed, some farmers took steps to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, sometimes even falsifying test results to make their animals appear free of infection. Recent advances in the analysis of milk-borne diseases have enabled scientists to track the DNA of the infectious bacteria to the cows on the farms that supplied the raw milk.\n\nThe recognition of many potentially deadly pathogens, such as \"E. coli\" 0157 H7, \"Campylobacter\", \"Listeria\", and \"Salmonella\", and their possible presence in poorly produced milk products has led to the continuation of pasteurization. The Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies of the United States strongly recommend that the public do not consume raw milk or raw milk products. Young children, the elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are more susceptible to infections originating in raw milk.\n\nMilk can be repasteurized, as is done when pasteurized milk is shipped from the US mainland to Hawaii, which can be done to extend the expiration date.\n\nThose favoring the consumption of raw milk believe that raw milk and associated products are more nutritious, build a healthy immune system and taste better. Those favoring the consumption of pasteurized milk consider the pathogen risk associated with drinking raw milk unacceptable.\n\nAgencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and other regulatory agencies around the world say that potential pathogenic bacteria from raw milk, including possibly tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid, and streptococcal infections, make it potentially unsafe to consume. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that \"raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. \n\nIn a microbiological aspect, raw milk from a healthy cow with clean teats generally does not immediately contain significant amounts of pathogens. Causes of significant pathogenic bacterial amounts in raw milk include:\n\nWith the exception of an altered organoleptic [flavor] profile, heating (particularly ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\"\n\nRaw milk advocates, such as the Weston A. Price Foundation, say that raw milk can be produced hygienically, and that it has health benefits that are destroyed in the pasteurization process. Research shows only very slight differences in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk.\n\nThree studies have found a statistically significant inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures on the basis of consumption or nonconsumption of raw milk. Aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle have been suggested as having a role in these differences, and for this reason, the overall phenomenon has been named the \"farm effect\". A recent scientific review concluded that \"most studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation of the raw milk's status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.\" For example, in the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma, and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis; \"the effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items themselves or their diversity.\"\n\nBefore purified milk was adopted in the US, public health officials were concerned with cow milk transmission of bovine tuberculosis to humans with an estimated 10% of all tuberculosis cases in humans being attributed to milk consumption. Along with specific diseases, officials continue to be concerned about outbreaks. With the use of modern pasteurization and sanitation practices milk accounts for less than 1% of reported outbreaks from food and water consumption. As comparison, raw milk was associated with 25% of all disease outbreaks from food/water during the time before World War II in the U.S. From a public health stand point pasteurization has decreased the percentage of milk associated food/water borne outbreaks.\n\nOutbreaks have occurred in the past from consuming food products made with raw milk. One of the potential pathogens in raw milk, \"Listeria monocytogenes\", can survive the pasteurization process and contaminate post-pasteurization environments. Milk and dairy products made with that milk then become recontaminated. Consistent contamination persists by bacteria survival in bio-films within the processing systems. One food item that has commonly used raw milk in its production in the past is cheese. Several different types of cheeses made with raw milk are consumed by a large portion of the United States population, including soft cheeses. Since Gouda cheese has a 60-day aging period prior to its consumption, it has previously been hypothesized that no bacteria would persist through that time. A review study published in the \"Journal of Food Protection\" showed that \"E. coli\" 0157:H7 has the ability to persist through the aging period of Gouda cheese. The study's evidence included three different outbreaks prior to 2013 associated with this specific strain of \"E. coli\" in Gouda cheese.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2016 there were 144 outbreaks connected to raw milk consumption in the United States. Because raw milk production skips the pasteurization process, the germs that are normally removed remain in the milk product. Exposure to raw milk containing harmful germs poses a threat of infection, resulting from bacteria including \"Camplyobacter\", \"Cryptosporidium\", \"E. coli\", \"Listeria\", and \"Salmonella\". Additionally, depending on the severity of infection, there may be further threat to human health. Infection has the potential to induce serious illness such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Because of the vulnerability of developing and degrading immune systems, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised are at a heightened risk of experiencing infection from raw milk consumption.\n\nOne study used mice to evaluate the difference in nutritional values between raw and pasteurized milk. Mice were separated into two groups: a pasteurized milk group and a raw milk group. Each group consisted of breeding pairs. The conclusion of the study measured no significant difference in weights of pasteurized to raw milk consuming mice. Birth weights were measured from each group and showed no significant differences between groups. Overall the study showed no measurable significant difference in nutritional value in growth and fertility of mice.\n\nRegulation of the commercial distribution of packaged raw milk varies around the world. Some countries have complete bans, but many had partial bans that do not restrict the purchase of raw milk bought directly from the farmer. Raw milk is sometimes distributed through a program, in which the consumer owns a share in the dairy animal or the herd, and therefore can be considered to be consuming milk from their own animal, which is legal. Raw milk is sometimes marketed for animal or pet consumption, or for other uses such as soap making in places where sales for human consumption are prohibited.\n\nAlthough milk consumption in Africa is fairly low compared to the rest of the world, in tribes where milk consumption is popular, such as the Maasai tribe, milk is typically consumed unpasteurized.\n\nIn rural areas of Asia where milk consumption is popular, milk is typically unpasteurized. In large cities of Asia, raw milk, especially from water buffalo, is typical. In most countries of Asia, laws prohibiting raw milk are nonexistent or rarely enforced.\n\nThe European Union requires that raw milk and products made with raw milk must be labeled to indicate this. Under EU hygiene rules, member states can prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of raw milk intended for human consumption. Also, European countries are free to add certain requirements. Usually special sanitary regulations and frequent quality tests (at least once per month) are mandatory.\n\nRaw-milk cheeses make up about 18 percent of France's total cheese production, and are considered far superior to cheeses made from pasteurised milk. Many French cuisine traditionalists consider pasteurized cheeses almost a sacrilege. Many traditional French cheeses have solely been made from raw milk for hundreds of years. Unpasteurised cheese in France is the major source of staphylococcal food poisoning.\n\nIn Germany, packaged raw milk may be sold in shops under the name \"Vorzugsmilch\". The raw milk has to be packed before vending, with the necessary information (producer, durability, and special warnings) written on the product. The distribution license has stringent quality restrictions, and so just 80 farmers in Germany have one.\n\nUnpackaged raw milk may only be sold under specific conditions. It must:\n\nPacked raw milk is sold widely in all health food stores, large supermarkets, gourmet delis and delicatessen sections of department stores. Raw milk is legally sold in the entire country, and the same goes for raw milk cheeses, which are especially sought out and promoted by the health food and slow food movements.\n\nShops are not permitted to sell unpasteurised milk to consumers in Norway Sweden Finland and Denmark. All four countries allow limited \"barn door\" sales subject to strict controls. One distributor in Denmark is licensed to supply restaurants with raw milk from approved farms. Pasteurisation of milk became common practice in Denmark and Sweden in the mid-1880s.\n\nRaw milk has been available from refrigerated milk vending machines (\"mlekomati\") all over the country since 2010. The milk sold in the machines is subject to stringent regular control.\nAs of 2018, raw milk is also available in shops.\n\nSales of raw drinking milk are prohibited in Scotland following a spate of deaths in 1983. While it is legal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the only registered producers are in England. About 200 producers sell raw, or \"green top\" milk directly to consumers, either at the farm, at a farmers' market, or through a delivery service, as it is legal to supply unpasteurised raw milk directly to consumers, but illegal to be sold to a retail shop. The bottle must display the warning \"this product has not been heat-treated and may contain organisms harmful to health\", and the dairy must conform to higher hygiene standards than dairies producing only pasteurised milk.\n\nThe sale of raw milk directly to consumers is prohibited in Canada under the \"Food and Drug Regulations\" since 1991.\n\nProvincial laws also forbid the sale and distribution of raw milk. For instance, Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act, subsection 18(1) reads: \"No person shall sell, offer for sale, deliver or distribute milk or cream that has not been pasteurized or sterilized in a plant that is licensed under the Milk Act or in a plant outside Ontario that meets the standards for plants licensed under the Milk Act.\"\n\nIn January 2010, Michael Schmidt was found not guilty on 19 charges relating to the sale of raw milk in the Ontario Court of Justice. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, that decision was overturned. Schmidt was convicted on thirteen counts and imposed fines totaling $9,150 and one year of probation. A subsequent appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed.\n\nIn British Columbia, Alice Jongerden and Michael Schmidt and Gordon Watson — persons involved in the operation of her raw milk dairy — attempted to avoid enforcement of a judgement against them under the Public Health Act by challenging the constitutionality of the legislation, which deems raw milk to be a hazardous product, on the grounds that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This argument, and other defenses invoked by her and defendants in her business, was rejected in 2013 by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which instead found Schmidt and Watson guilty of civil contempt, and sentenced them to a 3-month suspended sentence imprisonment with a probationary period of 1 year during which \"Any repetition of this contempt ... will trigger the imposed sentence imprisonment of 3 months.\" They were also charged special costs.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada does permit the sale of raw milk cheeses that are aged over 60 days. In 2009, the province of Quebec modified regulations to allow raw milk cheeses aged less than 60 days provided stringent safeguards are met.\n\nIn the early 20th century many states allowed the sale of raw milk that was certified by a \"medical milk commission\", effectively allowing an alternative of extra inspection for pasteurization. Now most states impose restrictions on raw milk suppliers due to concerns about safety. Forty-three U.S. states allow sales of raw milk. Cow shares can be found, and raw milk purchased for animal consumption in many states where retail for human consumption is prohibited. The sale of raw milk cheese is permitted as long as the cheese has been aged for 60 days or more.\n\nThe FDA reports that, in 2002, consuming partially heated raw milk and raw milk products caused 200 Americans to become ill in some manner.\n\nMany governmental officials and the majority of public health organizations hold to the need for pasteurization. Before pasteurization, many dairies, especially in cities, fed their cattle on low-quality food, and their milk was rife with dangerous bacteria. Pasteurizing it was the only way to make it safely drinkable. As pasteurization has been standard for many years, it is now widely assumed that raw milk is dangerous. The Cornell University Food Science Department has compiled data indicating that pathogenic microorganisms are present in between 0.87% and 12.6% of raw milk samples.\n\nProponents of raw milk (in the U.S.) advance two basic arguments for unpasteurized milk. They state that pasteurization destroys or damages some of the milk's nutrients, and that while pasteurization may kill dangerous bacteria, it also kills off good bacteria that raw milk supporters have stated to have health benefits. The United States Food and Drug administration has stated that this is false, and that pasteurizing milk does not destroy any of its nutritive value.\n\nProponents also invoke the benefits of direct-marketing when promoting the sale of raw milk. The ability of the farmer to eliminate the middle-man and sell directly to the consumer allows for greater profitability. Many manufacturers sell small-scale pasteurization equipment, thereby allowing farmers to both bypass the milk processors and sell pasteurized milk directly to the consumer. Additionally, some small U.S. dairies are now beginning to adopt low-temperature vat pasteurization. Advocates of low-temperature vat pasteurization note that it produces a product similar to raw milk in composition.\n\nAlongside the ongoing empirical debate, food freedom advocates cite libertarian arguments in claiming a basic civil right of each person to weigh the risks and benefits in choosing the food one eats.\n\nThe sale of raw milk for drinking purposes is illegal in all states and territories in Australia, as is all raw milk cheese. This has been circumvented somewhat by selling raw milk as \"bath milk\". An exception to the cheese rule has been made recently for two Roquefort cheeses. There is some indication of share owning cows, allowing the \"owners\" to consume the raw milk, but also evidence that the government is trying to close this loophole.\n\nOn November 8, 2015, 4 year old Apu Khangura died of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, 7 other children became seriously ill, the Victorian government created new regulations which require producers to treat raw milk to reduce pathogens, or to make the product unpalatable to taste, such as making it bitter.\n\nRaw milk for drinking and raw milk products can be made and sold in New Zealand, but are highly regulated to offset the pathogen risk. Producers of raw milk for sale to consumers must be registered. Raw milk must either be collected by the purchaser from the producer's farm or delivered to the purchaser's home.\n\nRaw yak milk is allowed to ferment overnight to become yak butter. Some cheeses are produced with raw milk although local statutes vary regarding what if any health precautions must be followed such as aging cheese for a certain amount of time.\n\nA thick mixture known as Syllabub was created by milkmaids squirting milk directly from a cow into a container of cider, beer, or other beverage.\n\n\n"}

In some places, especially in the U.S., a patty melt might consist only of the hamburger patty (with cheese) on a single piece of toast or a single bun. The hamburger is then fried with butter on a frying pan so that the cheese melts thoroughly. It is unclear when the patty melt was actually invented, but records exist of them having been served as early as the 1940s. The patty melt is a variant of the traditional American cheeseburger, taking the sandwich back to its roots by serving it on bread versus a bun.\n\nSeveral culinary writers suggested that Los Angeles restaurateur Tiny Naylor may have invented the patty melt sometime between 1930 and 1959, depending on the source. Even if Naylor did not invent the sandwich, it is agreed that Naylor and his family helped popularize the sandwich in their respective restaurants, that included Tiny Naylor's, Du-par's, and Wolfgang Puck's Granita, over the past half century or more.\n\n"}

The dish originated in the south of France. It is named after its traditional cooking vessel, the \"cassole\", a deep, round, earthenware pot with slanting sides.\n\nThe traditional homeland of cassoulet is the region once known as the province of Languedoc, especially the towns of Toulouse, Carcassonne, and Castelnaudary, that claims to be where the dish originated. The brotherhood of Cassoulet, \"La Grande Confrérie du Cassoulet de Castelnaudary\", has organized competitions and fairs about cassoulet every year since 1999.\n\nAll cassoulets are made with white beans (\"haricots blancs\" or \"lingots\"), duck or goose confit, sausages, and additional meat. In the cassoulet of Toulouse, the meats are pork and mutton, the latter frequently a cold roast shoulder. The Carcassonne version is similar but doubles the portion of mutton and sometimes replaces the duck with partridge. The cassoulet of Castelnaudary uses a duck confit instead of mutton.\n\nIn France, cassoulets of varying price and quality are also sold in cans and jars in supermarkets, grocery stores and charcuteries. The cheapest ones contain only beans, tomato sauce, sausages, and bacon. More expensive versions are likely to be cooked with goose fat and to include Toulouse sausages, lamb, goose, or duck confit.\n\nHaute cuisine versions require mixing pre-cooked roasted meats with beans that have been simmered separately with aromatic vegetables, but this runs counter to cassoulet's peasant origins. In the process of preparing the dish it is traditional to deglaze the pot from the previous cassoulet in order to give a base for the next one. This has led to stories, such as the one given by Elizabeth David, citing Anatole France, of a single original cassoulet being extended for years or even decades. The San Francisco bistro Le Central has kept its cassoulet this way for over 43 years.\nIn U.S. restaurants, the term \"cassoulet\" is often applied to any hearty bean-based casserole, with variations such as salmon cassoulet.\n"}

A roll can be served and eaten whole or cut transversely and dressed with filling between the two halves. Rolls are also commonly used to make sandwiches similar to those produced using slices of bread. They are found in most cuisines all over the world. In the \"Deipnosophistae\", the author Athenaeus (c. 170 – c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world. Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.\n\nEven in the same languages rolls are known by a variety of names. \n\nRolls are common in Europe, especially in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Hungary, the United Kingdom and other countries with a thriving bread culture.\n\nOther European languages have many local and dialectal terms for bread rolls. These include German language diminutives of \"Brot\" (bread) in most of western and central Germany (where they are called \"Brötchen\") and in Switzerland (where they are called \"Brötli\"). Other German language terms include \"Rundstück\" (\"round piece\") in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein; \"Semmel\" in Austria and southern Bavaria; \"Weck\" in much of Baden-Württemberg, Franconia and Saarland; \"Schrippe\" in Berlin and parts of Brandenburg.

The \"Doppelweck or Doppelbrötchen\" is a type of bread roll originating from the Saarland which consists of two rolls joined together side-by-side before baking.\n\nThere are several names for them in the United Kingdom including bap, barm, batch, bun, cob and teacake. \n\nA variety of rolls are found in Europe, from white rolls made with wheat flour, to dark rolls containing mostly rye flour. Many variants include spices, such as coriander and cumin, or nuts. Also common are bread rolls containing or garnished with whole seeds such as sesame, poppy, pumpkin or sunflower.\n\nBelow are the steps in the preparation of a Czech bread roll called \"houska\". \n"}

They are typically stuffed with a mix of meat (pork loin, raw prosciutto, Mortadella), and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Originally from the Italian region of Emilia (in particular Bologna and Modena), they are usually served in broth (\"in brodo\"), either of beef, chicken, or both.\nPacked, dried and refrigerated or frozen, tortellini and tortelloni (similar but larger, with cheese and/or vegetable stuffing) appear in many locations around the world, especially where there are large Italian communities. Tortellini and tortelloni are made in European industrial lines supplying markets in Europe and further afield.\n\nThe origin of tortellini is disputed; both Bologna and Modena, cities in Italy's Emilia-Romagna region, claim to be its birthplace. OxfordDictionaries.com traces the etymology of \"tortellini\" to the diminutive form of \"tortello\", itself a diminutive of \"torta\". Both reference cake. The recipe for a dish called torteletti appears in 1570 from Bartolomeo Scappi. Vincenzo Tanara's writings in the mid-17th century may be responsible for the pasta's renaming to tortellini. In the 1800s, legends sprang up to explain the recipe's origins, offering a compromise. Castelfranco Emilia, located between Bologna and Modena, is featured in one legend, in which Venus stays at an inn. Overcome by her beauty, the innkeeper spies on her through a keyhole, through which he can only see her navel. He is inspired to create a pasta in this shape. In honor of this legend, an annual festival is held in Castelfranco Emilia. Another legend posits that the shape comes from Modena's architecture, which resembles a turtle.\n\nTortelloni is pasta in the same shape, but larger, typically 5 g, vs. 2 g for tortellini. Although either can be filled with a wide variety of foods, meat-based filling is less common in tortelloni. Tortellini may be served with sauce or in a broth; tortelloni are rarely served in a broth.\n\n\"Tortellini pasta, with cheese filling, fresh-refrigerated, as purchased\"\n\n– Source:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are commonly available in the frozen food section of supermarkets. They can be baked in the oven, grilled, shallow fried, or deep-fried.\n\nThe term \"fish fingers\" is first referenced in a recipe given in a British popular magazine in 1900, and the dish is often considered symbolic of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe commercialization of fish fingers may be traced to 1953 when the American company Gorton-Pew Fisheries, now known as Gorton's, was the first company to introduce a frozen ready-to-cook fish finger; the product, named \"Gorton's Fish Sticks\", won the \"Parents\" magazine Seal of Approval in 1956.\n\nThere was an abundance of herring in the United Kingdom after World War II. Clarence Birdseye test-marketed herring fish fingers, a product he had discovered in the United States, under the name \"herring savouries\". These were tested in Southampton and South Wales against \"cod sticks\", a comparatively bland product used as a control. Shoppers, however, confounded expectations by showing an overwhelming preference for the cod. The snack was nearly called Battered Cod Pieces, until a poll of Birds Eye workers opted for the snappier Fish Fingers.\n\nThe fish used may be either fillets cut to shape or minced/ground fish reformed to shape. Those made entirely from fillets are generally regarded as the higher quality products and will typically have a prominent sign on the box stating that the fish is 100% fillet. Minced fish is more commonly used in store brand economy products. They may have either batter or breadcrumbs around the outside as casing, although the coating is normally breadcrumbs.\n\nIn addition to white fish, fish fingers are sometimes made with salmon.\n\n\n"}

It includes a variety of lemonade, carbonated waters and ginger ales.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, Johann Jacob Schweppe developed a process to manufacture carbonated mineral water based on the discoveries of Joseph Priestley. Schweppe founded the Schweppes Company in Geneva in 1783 to sell carbonated water. In 1792, he moved to London to develop the business there. In 1843, Schweppes commercialised Malvern Water at the Holywell Spring in the Malvern Hills, which was to become a favourite of the British Royal Family until parent company Coca-Cola closed the historic plant in 2010 to local outcry.\n\nIn 1969, the Schweppes Company merged with Cadbury to become Cadbury Schweppes. After acquiring many other brands in the ensuing years, the company was split in 2008, with its US beverage unit becoming Keurig Dr Pepper and separated from its global confectionery business (now part of Mondelez International). Keurig Dr Pepper is the current owner of the Schweppes trademark.\n\nMainstay Schweppes products include ginger ale (1870), bitter lemon (1957), and tonic water (the first carbonated tonic – 1871).\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the artist William Barribal created a range of posters for Schweppes. In 1945, the advertising agency S.T.Garland Advertising Service Ltd., London coined the word 'Schweppervescence' which was first used the following year. Thereafter it was used extensively in advertisements produced by Garlands who sold copyright of this word to the Schweppes Company for £150 five years later when they relinquished the account.\n\nAn ad campaign in the 1950s and 1960s featured a real-life veteran British naval officer named Commander Whitehead, who described the product's bubbly flavour (effervescence) as evanescence. Comedian Benny Hill also appeared in a series of Schweppes TV commercials in the 1960s.\n\nAnother campaign made use of onomatopoeia in their commercials: \"Schhh… You know who.\" after the sound of the gas escaping as one opens the bottle.\n\n"}
{"id": "581997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=581997", "title": "Pilaf", "text": "Pilaf\n\nPilaf (US spelling), or pilau (UK spelling) is a rice dish or, in some regions, a wheat dish, whose recipe usually involves cooking in stock, adding spices, and other ingredients such as meat, and employing some technique for achieving cooked grains that do not adhere.\n\nAt the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, such methods of cooking rice at first spread through a vast territory from Spain to Afghanistan, and eventually to a wider world. The Spanish \"paella\", and the South Asian \"pilau\" or \"pulao\", and \"biryani\", evolved from such dishes.\n\nPilaf and similar dishes are common to Balkan, Middle Eastern, Eastern Europe, South Caucasian, Central and South Asian, East African, Latin American, and Caribbean cuisines. It is a staple food and a popular dish in Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Israel, Crete, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Kurdistan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Uganda, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Xinjiang, and Uzbekistan.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", Third Edition (2006) the English word \"pilaf\", which is the later and North American English form of spelling the word \"pilau\", is a borrowing from Turkish, its etymon, or linguistic ancestor, the Turkish \"pilav\", whose etymon is the Persian pilāv; \"pilaf\" is found more commonly in North American dictionaries than \"pilau\".\n\nThe British and Commonwealth English spelling, \"pilau\", has etymon Persian \"pulaw\" (in form palāv , pilāv , or pulāv in the 16th century), whose line of descent is: Hindi \"pulāv\" (dish of rice and meat), Sanskrit \"pulāka\" (ball of rice), which in turn is probably of Dravidian descent (in the modern Dravidian language Tamil \"puḷukku\" means (adjective) simmered, (noun) boiled or parboiled food, \"puḷukkal\" cooked rice).\n\nAlthough the cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from South Asia to Central and West Asia, it was at the time of the Abbasid Caliphate that methods of cooking rice which approximate modern styles of cooking the pilaf at first spread through a vast territory from Spain to Afghanistan, and eventually to a wider world. The Spanish \"paella\", and the South Asian \"pilau\" or \"pulao\", and \"biryani\", evolved from such dishes.\n\nAccording to author K. T. Achaya, the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\" mentions an instance of rice and meat cooked together. Also, according to Achaya, \"pulao\" or \"pallao\" is used to refer to a rice dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the \"Yājñavalkya Smṛti\". However, according to other authors, these references do not substantially correlate to the commonly used meaning and history implied in pilafs, which appear in Indian accounts after the medieval Central Asian Muslim invasions of India.\n\nSimilarly Alexander the Great and his army have been reported to be so impressed with Bactrian and Sogdian \"pilavs\" that his soldiers brought the recipes back to Macedonia when they returned. Similar stories exist of Alexander introducing pilaf to Samarkand; however, they are considered apocryphal by art historian John Boardman.\n\nThe earliest documented recipe for pilaf comes from the tenth-century Persian scholar Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Ibn Sina to be the \"father\" of modern pilaf. Thirteenth-century Arab texts describe the consistency of pilaf that the grains should be plump and somewhat firm to resemble peppercorns with no mushiness, and each grain should be separate with no clumping.\n\nAnother primary source for pilaf dishes comes from the 17th-century Iranian philosopher Molla Sadra.\n\nPilau became standard fare in the Middle East and Transcaucasia over the years with variations and innovations by the Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians. It was introduced to Israel by Bukharan and Persian Jews.\n\nDuring the period of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common Soviet cuisine.\n\nSome cooks prefer to use basmati because it is easier to prepare a pilaf where the grains stay \"light, fluffy and separate\" with this type of rice. However, other types of long-grain rice are also used. The rice is rinsed thoroughly before use to remove the starch. Pilaf can be cooked in water or stock. Common additions include fried onions and fragrant spices like cardamom, bay leaves and cinnamon. Pilaf is usually made with meat or vegetables, but it can also be made plain which is called \"sade pilav\" in Turkish, \"chelo\" in Farsi and \"ruzz mufalfal\" in Arabic. On special occasions saffron may be used to give the rice a yellow color. Pilaf is often made by adding the rice to hot fat and stirring briefly before adding the cooking liquid. The fat used varies from recipe to recipe. Cooking methods vary with respect to details such as pre-soaking the rice and steaming after boiling.\n\nThere are thousands of variations of pilaf made with rice or other grains like bulgur. In Central Asia there are \"plov\", \"pilau\" on the Indian subcontinent, and variations from Turkmenistan and Turkey. Some include different combinations of meats, fruits or vegetables, while others are simple and served plain. In the present day , Central Asian, Indian, Turkish cuisine, Iranian and Caribbean cuisine are considered the five major schools of pilaf.\n\nIn Afghan cuisine, \"Kabuli palaw\" or \"qabili palaw\" (Dari : قابلی پلو ) is made by cooking basmati with mutton, lamb, beef or chicken, and oil. Kabuli Palaw is cooked in large shallow and thick dishes. Fried sliced carrots and raisins are added. Chopped nuts like pistachios, walnuts, or almonds may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. The Kabuli Palaw rice with carrots and raisins is very popular in Saudi Arabia, where it is known as \"roz Bukhari\" (Arabic: رز بخاري), meaning Bukharan rice.\n\nArmenians use a lot of \"bulgur\" (cracked wheat) in their pilaf dishes. Armenian recipes may combine vermicelli or orzo with rice cooked in stock seasoned with mint, parsley and allspice. One traditional Armenian pilaf is made with the same noodle rice mixture cooked in stock with raisins, almonds and allspice.\n\nArmenian rices are discussed by Rose Baboian in her cookbook from 1964 which includes recipes for different pilafs, most rooted in her birthplace of Aintab in Turkey. Baboian recommends that the noodles be stir fried first in chicken fat before being added to the pilaf. Another Armenian cookbook written by Vağinag Pürad recommends to render poultry fat in the oven with red pepper until the fat mixture turns a red color before using the strained fat to prepare pilaf.\n\n\"Lapa\" is an Armenian word with several meanings one of which is a \"watery boiled rice, thick rice soup, mush\" and \"lepe\" which refers to various rice dishes differing by region. Antranig Azhderian describes Armenian pilaf as \"dish resembling porridge\".\n\nAzerbaijani cuisine includes more than 40 different plov recipes. One of the most reputed dishes is plov from saffron-covered rice, served with various herbs and greens, a combination distinctive from Uzbek plovs. Traditional Azerbaijani plov consists of three distinct components, served simultaneously but on separate platters: rice (warm, never hot), \"gara\" (fried meat, dried fruits, eggs, or fish prepared as an accompaniment to rice), and aromatic herbs. Rice is not mixed with the other components even when eating plov.\nIn Bangladesh, \"Pulao\" (), \"Fulao\", \"Holao\" or \"Fulab\", is a popular dish cooked with rice and meat (chicken or mutton or beef). Pulao is a rice dish, cooked in seasoned broth with rice, meat and spices. A pulao is often complimented with raita. The rice is made in mutton or beef or chicken stock and an array of spices including: coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cloves and others. The Morog Pulao in the division of Dhaka is prepared with chicken. It is prepared in marriage ceremonies, condolence meetings, and other occasions. It is often complimented with borhani.\n\nA significantly modified version of the recipe, often seen as influenced by what is called there, is known in Brazil as or incorrectly (, \"shredded chicken rice\", , \"chicken risotto\"). Rice lightly fried (and optionally seasoned), salted and cooked until soft (but neither soupy nor sticky) in either water or chicken stock is added to chicken stock, onions and sometimes cubed bell peppers (cooked in the stock), shredded chicken breast, green peas, tomato sauce, shoyu, and optionally vegetables (e.g. canned sweet corn, cooked carrot cubes, courgette cubes, broccolini flowers, chopped broccoli or broccolini stalks/leaves fried in garlic seasoning) and/or herbs (e.g. mint, like in ) to form a distantly risotto-like dish – but it is generally fluffy (depending on the texture of the rice being added), as generally, once all ingredients are mixed, it is not left to cook longer than 5 minutes. In the case shredded chicken breast is not added, with the rice being instead served alongside chicken and , it is known as (, \"chicken supreme rice\").\n\nIn the Eastern Caribbean and other Caribbean territories there are variations of \"pelau\" which include a wide range of ingredients such as pigeon peas, green peas, string beans, corn, carrots, pumpkin, and meat such as beef or chicken, or cured pig tail. The seasoned meat is usually cooked in a stew, with the rice and other vegetables added afterwards. Coconut milk and spices are also key additions in some islands.\n\nTrinidad is recognized for its \"pelau\", a layered rice with meats and vegetables. It is a mix of traditional African cuisine and \"New World\" ingredients like ketchup. The process of browning the meat (usually chicken, but also stew beef or lamb) in sugar is an African technique.\n\nIn Tobago \"pelau\" is commonly made with crab.\n\nCentral Asian, e.g. Tajik and Uzbek \"plov\" (, ) or \"osh\" differs from other preparations in that rice is not steamed, but instead simmered in a rich stew of meat and vegetables called \"zirvak\", until all the liquid is absorbed into the rice. A limited degree of steaming is commonly achieved by covering the pot. It is usually cooked in a \"kazan\" (or \"deghi\") over an open fire. The cooking tradition includes many regional and occasional variations. Commonly, it is prepared with lamb, browned in lamb fat or oil, and then stewed with fried onions, garlic and carrots. Chicken plov is rare but found in traditional recipes originating in Bukhara. Plov is usually spiced with whole black cumin, coriander, barberries, red pepper, marigold, and pepper. Heads of garlic and garbanzo beans are buried into the rice during cooking. Sweet variations with dried apricots, cranberries and raisins are prepared on special occasions. \n\nAlthough often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, plov is made on special occasions by the \"oshpaz\" (osh master chef), who cooks the national dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. \"Oshi nahor\", or \"morning plov\", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. \n\nThe Uzbek-style plov cooking recipes are spread nowadays throughout all post-Soviet countries and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. \nIn the Greek cuisine, \"piláfi\" (πιλάφι) is the fluffy and soft, but neither soupy nor sticky, rice that has been boiled in a meat stock or bouillon broth. In Northern Greece, it is considered poor form to prepare \"piláfi\" on a stovetop; the pot is properly placed in the oven. \"Gamopílafo\" (\"wedding pilaf\") is the prized pilaf served traditionally at weddings and major celebrations in Crete: rice is boiled in lamb or goat broth, then finished with lemon juice. \"Gamopílafo\" though it bears the name is not a pilaf but rather a kind of risotto, with creamy and not fluffy texture.\n\n\"Pulao\" is usually associated with Moghul cuisine. The dish consists of rice and a mixture of either lentils or vegetables, mainly including peas, potatoes, french beans, carrots or meat, mainly chicken, fish, lamb, pork or prawn. There are very elaborate \"pulaos\" with Persianized names like \"hazar pasand\" (\"a thousand delights\"). It is usually served on special occasions and weddings, though it is not uncommon to eat it for a regular lunch or dinner meal. It is considered very high in food energy and fat. A pulao is often complemented with either spiced yogurt or \"raita\".\n\nPersian culinary terms referring to rice preparation are numerous and have found their way into the neighbouring languages: \"polo\" (rice cooked in broth while the grains remain separate, straining the half cooked rice before adding the broth and then \"brewing\"), \"chelo\" (white rice with separate grains), \"kateh\" (sticky rice) and \"tajine\" (slow cooked rice, vegetables, and meat cooked in a specially designed dish also called a tajine). There are also varieties of different rice dishes with vegetables and herbs which are very popular among Iranians.\n\nThere are four primary methods of cooking rice in Iran:\n\nIn Pakistan, \"Pulao\" () is a popular dish cooked with Basmati rice and meat (chicken or mutton or beef). Pulao is a rice dish, cooked in seasoned broth with rice, meat and spices. A pulao is often complimented with raita. The rice is made in mutton or beef or chicken stock and an array of spices including: coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cloves and others. Mutton and beef have, with time, been replaced with chicken due to higher prices of mutton. The Sindhi pulao () in the province of Sindh, prepared with mutton or beef or chicken. It is prepared by Sindhi people of Pakistan in their marriage ceremonies, condolence meetings, and other occasions.\n\nTraditional Levantine cooking includes a variety of Pilaf known as \"Maqlubeh\", known across the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The rice pilaf which is traditionally cooked with meats, eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, and cauliflower also has a fish variety known as \"Sayyadiyeh\", or the Fishermen's Dish.\n\nHistorically, mutton stock was the most common cooking liquid for Turkish pilafs, which according to 19th century American sources was called \"pirinç\".\n\nTurkish cuisine contains many different pilaf types and is the inspiration behind most of the variations in Armenia, Balkans, Greece, and Arab countries due to their past under Ottoman Empire rule. Some of these variations are pirinc (\"rice\") pilaf, \"bulgur\" pilaf, and arpa şehriye (\"orzo\") pilaf. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as \"perdeli pilav\", and \"etli pilav\" (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilaf that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.\n\n\n\n"}

Mattson later recounted that he invented St. Urho when he was questioned by coworker Gene McCavic about the Finns' lack of a saint like the Irish St. Patrick, whose feat of casting the snakes out of Ireland is remembered on St. Patrick's Day. In fact, the patron saint of Finland is Saint Henry.\n\nAccording to the original \"Ode to St. Urho\" written by Gene McCavic and Richard Mattson, St. Urho was supposed to have cast \"tose 'Rogs\" (those frogs) out of Finland by the power of his loud voice, which he obtained by drinking \"feelia sour\" (sour whole milk) and eating \"kala mojakka\" (fish soup). The selection of the name Urho as the saint's name was probably influenced by the accession of Urho Kekkonen to the presidency of Finland in 1956. \"Urho\" in the Finnish language also has the meaning of \"hero\" or simply \"brave\".\n\nThe original \"Ode to St. Urho\" identified St. Urho's Day as taking place on May 24. Later the date was changed to March 16, the day before St. Patrick's Day so the Finns could start drinking green beer a day before the Irish. St. Urho's feast is supposed to be celebrated by wearing the colors Royal Purple and Nile Green. Other details of the invented legend also changed, apparently under the influence of Dr. Sulo Havumäki, a psychology professor at Bemidji State College in Bemidji, Minnesota. The legend now states that St. Urho drove away grasshoppers (rather than frogs) from Finland using the incantation \"\"Heinäsirkka, heinäsirkka, mene täältä hiiteen!\"\" (\"Grasshopper, grasshopper, go from hence to Hell!\"), thus saving the Finnish grape crops.\nAnother version of the modern celebration of St. Urho's Day is that it was created by Kenneth Brist of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Brist, a high school teacher, was teaching in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early to mid-1950s in an area largely populated by people of Finnish heritage. He and his friends concocted March 16 as St. Urho's Day so that they had two days to celebrate, the next day being St. Patrick's Day.\n\nBrist promoted the \"annual cancellation\" of the St. Urho's Day Parade in Chippewa Falls with advertisements in the Chippewa Herald Telegram and by teaching his high school students about the legend of St. Urho.\nThe \"Ode to St. Urho\" has been modified to reflect these changes in the feast day and legend. The Ode is written in a self-parodying form of English as spoken by Finnish immigrants. There is also a \"Ballad of St. Urho\" written by Sally Karttunen.\n\nThere are St. Urho fan clubs in Canada and Finland as well as the U.S., and the festival is celebrated on March 16 in many American and Canadian communities with Finnish roots. The original statue of St. Urho is located in Menahga, Minnesota. Another interesting chainsaw-carved St. Urho statue is located in Finland, Minnesota. A 2001 book, \"The Legend of St. Urho\" by Joanne Asala, presents much of the folklore surrounding St. Urho and includes an essay by Richard Mattson on the \"birth\" of St. Urho.\n\nOn March 16, 1999 in Kaleva, Michigan a large Metal Sculpture of a Grasshopper was dedicated in honor of St. Urho's day. Kaleva is a community settled by Finnish immigrants in 1900. Kaleva is named after the Kalevala, the Epic Finnish story about the Creation of the Earth.\n\nMany places with mixed populations of Finnish and Irish have an annual St. Urho's day event on the night before St. Patrick's Day. Butte, Montana holds such a celebration each March 16.\n\nThunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, just north of Minnesota, is another location where St. Urho's Day is joyfully celebrated on the weekend nearest to March 16. The Finlandia Club is the headquarters for all that is Finnish in northern Ontario. A grasshopper slung on a pole is hauled through the streets in a parade through the streets near the Finlandia club where the celebration continues with food, music and dance.\n\nAlthough St. Urho’s Day is not widely known or celebrated in Finland, it has been celebrated in Turku since 1987. At the University of Turku students studying Folkloristics, Comparative Religion and Ethnology have organized a St. Urho’s Day play yearly since 1987.\n"}

In more recent decades the Chienbäse have been augmented with carts carrying bonfires, with flames often reaching as high as the houses. The parade is attended by thousands of spectators from Switzerland as well as from countries around the globe, closely packed on either side of the small street. \n\nThe origins of the custom are open to speculation. Often identified as a \"pagan spring ritual\" due to the archaic qualities of the fire spectacle, the earliest report of a procession of torch bearers dates to 1869.

A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. A good can be placed along a continuum ranging from rivalrous to non-rivalrous. The same characteristic is sometimes referred to as jointness of supply or subtractable or non-subtractable.\n\nMost tangible goods, both durable and nondurable, are rival goods. A hammer is a durable rival good. One person's use of the hammer presents a significant barrier to others who desire to use that hammer at the same time. However, the first user does not \"use up\" the hammer, meaning that some rival goods can still be shared through time. An apple is a nondurable rival good: once an apple is eaten, it is \"used up\" and can no longer be eaten by others. Non-tangible goods can also be rivalrous. Examples include the ownership of radio spectra and domain names. In more general terms, almost all private goods are rivalrous.\n\nIn contrast, non-rival goods may be consumed by one consumer without preventing simultaneous consumption by others. Most examples of non-rival goods are intangible. Broadcast television is an example of a non-rival good; when a consumer turns on a TV set, this does not prevent the TV in another consumer's house from working. The television itself is a rival good, but television broadcasts are non-rival goods. Other examples of non-rival goods include a beautiful scenic view, national defense, clean air, street lights, and public safety. More generally, most intellectual property is non-rival. In fact, certain types of intellectual property become \"more\" valuable as more people consume them (anti-rival). For example, the more people use a particular language, the more valuable that language becomes.\n\nNon-rivalry does not imply that the total production costs are low, but that the \"marginal\" production costs are zero. In reality, few goods are completely non-rival as rivalry can emerge at certain levels. For instance, use of public roads, the Internet, or police/law courts is non-rival up to a certain capacity, after which congestion means that each additional user decreases speed for others. For that, recent economic theory views rivalry as a continuum, not as a binary category, where many goods are somewhere between the two extremes of completely rival and completely non-rival. A perfectly non-rival good can be consumed simultaneously by an unlimited number of consumers.\n\nGoods that are both non-rival and non-excludable are called public goods. It is generally accepted by mainstream economists that the market mechanism will under-provide public goods, so these goods have to be produced by other means, including government provision.\n"}

Its flavour is unique and is described as having woodruff, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon and almond notes.\n\nThe rye distillate is flavoured with a tincture of bison grass (\"Hierochloe odorata\"), which also gives the spirit its yellowish color. This grass grows in the Białowieża Forest and elsewhere. A blade of bison grass is traditionally placed in each bottle of żubrówka, though this is largely decorative.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, there are also new brands available in Poland, such as Żubrówka Biała Wódka (white), Żubrówka Czarna Wódka (black) and Żubrówka Złota (gold).\n\nThe words in the Belarusian language and in Russian are the words for bison grass. In Polish, the word is used for the grass. The name comes from \"zubr\" (, ), the word for the European bison in many Slavic languages.\n\nThe zubrovka has been produced since at least the 16th century in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the region of the contemporary Polish-Belarusian border. By the 18th century it was one of the favorite raw drinks of nobility (\"szlachta\") and peasantry alike.\n\nIn the 19th century, the famous Odessa-based brandy manufacturer began producing żubrówka.\n\nIn 1926, the company Polmos from Brześć nad Bugiem (now Brest, Belarus) invented a method to mass-produce żubrówka, which was then copied by numerous companies worldwide, under a variety of brand names. The original distillery company in Brest (nationalized by the Soviets after 1939 and now known under the name Belalco) still produces \"Brestskaya Zubrovka\". There are also brands of zubrovka in many countries including Lithuania (\"Stumbrinė\"), United States (\"Bison Vodka\"), Ukraine (Зубрiвка, \"Zubrivka\"), Germany (\"Grasovka\" and \"Blauer Bison\"), Russia (Зубровка, \"Zubrovka\"), the Czech Republic (\"Zubrovka\"), and others.\n\nCurrently the brands \"Zubrovka\" and \"Żubrówka\" are registered by Sojuzplodoimport/Russia and the Polmos Białystok company in Białystok, Poland. However, żubrówka is considered a generic name for a type of liquor by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, so anyone may use the name for products in the United States, and the name has been used by various companies there.\n\n\nThe tincture of bison grass found in żubrówka is prohibited as a food additive by the Food and Drug Administration because it contains coumarin, which showed hepatotoxic effects in rats and has a blood thinning effect. Importation of żubrówka was banned in 1978 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Canada has no similar regulations on coumarin, so the alcoholic drink is legal there.\n\nWhen produced according to traditional methods (between one and two kilograms of grass per thousand litres of alcohol), żubrówka contains approximately 12 milligrams of coumarin per litre. In 1999, distilleries that were not connected with the Polish brand introduced lower quality reformulated versions of the product, sometimes using artificial flavours and colors, with the emblematic blade of grass in every bottle but \"neutralised\" so as to be coumarin-free. In 2011 the American licensee of the Polish company worked with Rémy Cointreau to introduce a new American formulation, which they called \"Żu\".\n\nIn addition to the coumarin problem, American authorities determined that the trademark on Żubrówka brand was diluted and unenforceable, as it was a generic name, like \"aspirin\".\n\nLike most vodkas, żubrówka is usually served chilled on its own. A very popular alternative is mixing it with apple juice (a drink known in Polish as \"tatanka\" (Lakota for \"American bison\") or \"szarlotka\" (Polish for \"apple cake\"); known in the UK as a \"Frisky Bison\"; and in the US as a \"Polish Kiss\"). It is sometimes served over vanilla ice cream, and another common mixer is ginger ale. While a \"Black Bison\" is żubrówka mixed with black currant juice.\n\n"}

{"id": "585383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=585383", "title": "Pulmonology", "text": "Pulmonology\n\nPulmonology is a medical speciality that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract. The term is derived from the Latin word \"pulmō, pulmōnis\" (\"lung\") and the Greek suffix , \"-logia\" (\"study of\"). Pulmonology is synonymous with pneumology (from Greek πνεύμων (\"lung\") and -λογία), respirology and respiratory medicine.\n\nPulmonology is known as chest medicine and respiratory medicine in some countries and areas. \"Pulmonology\" is considered a branch of internal medicine, and is related to intensive care medicine. Pulmonology often involves managing patients who need life support and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonologists are specially trained in diseases and conditions of the chest, particularly pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, emphysema, and complicated chest infections. \n\n\nOne of the first major discoveries relevant to the field of pulmonology was the discovery of pulmonary circulation. Originally, it was thought that blood reaching the right side of the heart passed through small 'pores' in the septum into the left side to be oxygenated, as theorized by Galen; however, the discovery of pulmonary circulation disproves this theory, which had previously been accepted since the 2nd century. Thirteenth century anatomist and physiologist Ibn Al-Nafis accurately theorized that there was no 'direct' passage between the two sides (ventricles) of the heart. He believed that the blood must have passed through the pulmonary artery, through the lungs, and back into the heart to be pumped around the body. This is believed by many to be the first scientific description of pulmonary circulation.\n\nAlthough pulmonary medicine only began to evolve as a medical specialty in the 1950s, William Welch and William Osler founded the 'parent' organization of the American Thoracic Society, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis. The care, treatment, and study of tuberculosis of the lung is recognised as a discipline in its own right, phthisiology. When the specialty did begin to evolve, several discoveries were being made linking the respiratory system and the measurement of arterial blood gases, attracting more and more physicians and researchers to the developing field.\n\nSurgery of the respiratory tract is generally performed by specialists in cardiothoracic surgery (or thoracic surgery), though minor procedures may be performed by pulmonologists. Pulmonology is closely related to critical care medicine when dealing with patients who require mechanical ventilation. As a result, many pulmonologists are certified to practice critical care medicine in addition to pulmonary medicine. There are fellowship programs that allow physicians to become board certified in pulmonary and critical care medicine simultaneously. Interventional pulmonology is a relatively new field within pulmonary medicine that deals with the use of procedures such as bronchoscopy and pleuroscopy to treat several pulmonary diseases. Interventional pulmonology is increasingly recognized as a specific medical specialty.\n\nThe pulmonologist begins the diagnostic process with a general review focusing on:\n\n\nPhysical diagnostics are as important as in other fields of medicine.\n\n\nAs many heart diseases can give pulmonary signs, a thorough cardiac investigation is usually included.\n\nPulmonary clinical procedures include the following pulmonary tests and procedures:\n\n\nMajor surgical procedures on the heart and lungs are performed by a thoracic surgeon. Pulmonologists often perform specialized procedures to get samples from the inside of the chest or inside of the lung. They use radiographic techniques to view vasculature of the lungs and heart to assist with diagnosis.\n\nMedication is the most important treatment of most diseases of pulmonology, either by inhalation (bronchodilators and steroids) or in oral form (antibiotics, leukotriene antagonists). A common example being the usage of inhalers in the treatment of inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Oxygen therapy is often necessary in severe respiratory disease (emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis). When this is insufficient, the patient might require mechanical ventilation.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation has been defined as a multidimensional continuum of services directed to persons with pulmonary disease and their families, usually by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, with the goal of achieving and maintaining the individual's maximum level of independence and functioning in the community. Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and prognosis for the patient. Interventions can include exercise, education, emotional support, oxygen, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, optimization of airway secretion clearance, promoting compliance with medical care to reduce numbers of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and returning to work and/or a more active and emotionally satisfying life. These goals are appropriate for any patients with diminished respiratory reserve whether due to obstructive or intrinsic pulmonary diseases (oxygenation impairment) or neuromuscular weakness (ventilatory impairment). A pulmonary rehabilitation team may include a rehabilitation physician, a pulmonary medicine specialist, and allied health professionals including a rehabilitation nurse, a respiratory therapist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a psychologist, and a social worker among others. Additionally breathing games are used to motivate children to perform pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\nIn the United States, pulmonologists are physicians who, after receiving a medical degree (MD or DO), complete residency training in internal medicine, followed by at least two additional years of subspeciality fellowship training in pulmonology. After satisfactorily completing a fellowship in pulmonary medicine, the physician is permitted to take the board certification examination in pulmonary medicine. After passing this exam, the physician is then board certified as a pulmonologist. Most pulmonologists complete three years of combined subspecialty fellowship training in pulmonary medicine and critical care medicine.\n\nIn the United States, pediatric pulmonologists are physicians who, after receiving a medical degree (MD or DO), complete residency training in pediatrics, followed by at least three additional years of subspeciality fellowship training in pulmonology.\n\nPulmonologists are involved in both clinical and basic research of the respiratory system, ranging from the anatomy of the respiratory epithelium to the most effective treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Scientific research also takes place to look for causes and possible treatment in diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer.\n"}

{"id": "586629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586629", "title": "Bugger", "text": "Bugger\n\nBugger or \"buggar\" is a mild swear word. In the United Kingdom, the term is a general-purpose expletive, used to imply dissatisfaction, or to refer to someone or something whose behaviour is in some way displeasing or perhaps surprising. In the US, particularly in the Midwest and South, it is a slang but not offensive noun meaning \"small critter.\"\n\nThe term is used in the vernacular British English, Australian English, New Zealand English, South African English, Indian English, Pakistani English, Canadian English, Caribbean English, Malaysian English and in Sri Lankan English.\n\nIt is derived from Anglo-Norman bougre, which has also given the term buggery.\n\nBugger—also bowgard, bouguer (ancient French – \"bougre\"): from Latin – \"Bulgarus\", a name given to a sect of heretics who were thought to have come from Bulgaria in the 11th century, after other \"heretics\" to whom abominable practices were imputed in an abusively disparaging manner.\n\nThe term is thought to have started around the early 13th century, after Pope Innocent III and the northern French kingdom went on the Albigensian crusade in southern France, which led to the slaughter of about 20,000 men, women and children, Cathar and Catholic alike and brought the region firmly under the control of the King of France. The brutal crusade was directed not only against heretical Christians, but also against the nobility of Toulouse and vassals of the Crown of Aragon. The populace of Provence and Northern Italy sympathized with the victims of the crusade because of their moral purity. It was then that the Catholic clergy launched a vilifying campaign against them, associating them with unorthodox sexual practices and sodomy.\n\nThe word may be used amongst friends in an affectionate way and is used as a vernacular noun to imply that one is very fond of something (\"I'm a bugger for Welsh cakes\"). It can also imply a negative tendency (\"He's a silly bugger for losing his keys\") [i.e., He's a fool for often losing his keys].\n\nIn some English speaking communities the word has been in use traditionally without any profane connotations. For instance, within the Anglo-Indian community in India the word \"bugger\" has been in use, in an affectionate manner, to address or refer to a close friend or fellow schoolmate. In the United States it can be a rough synonym to whippersnapper as in calling a young boy a \"little bugger\".\n\nIn 1978 Judge Melford Stevenson called the British Sexual Offences Act 1967 a \"buggers' charter\".\n\nAs a verb, the word is used by the British to denote sodomy. In GB, the phrase \"Bugger me sideways\" (or a variation of this) can be used as an expression of surprise. It can also be used as a synonym for \"broken\", as in \"This PC's buggered\"; \"Oh no! I've buggered it up\"; or \"It's gone to buggery\". In Anglophone Southern Africa, also in Australia and GB, \"buggered\" is colloquially used to describe something, usually a machine or vehicle, as broken.\n\nThe phrase \"bugger off\" (\"bug off\" in American English) means to go, or run, away; when used as a command it means \"go away\" (\"get lost\" or \"leave me alone\") and can also be used in much the same type of relatively offensive manner.\n\n\"I'm buggered\", \"I'll be buggered\" and \"bugger me\" are used colloquially in GB (and often in New Zealand and Australia as well) to denote or feign surprise at an unexpected (or possibly unwanted) occurrence. \"I'm buggered\" can also be used to indicate a state of fatigue. In this latter form it found fame in New Zealand in 1956 through rugby player Peter Jones, who—in a live post-match radio interview - declared himself \"absolutely buggered\", a turn of phrase considered shocking at the time.\n\nIt is famously alleged that the last words of King George V were \"Bugger Bognor\", in response to a suggestion that he might recover from his illness and visit Bognor Regis . Variations on the phrase \"bugger it\" are commonly used to imply frustration, admission of defeat or the sense that something is not worth doing, as in \"bugger this for a lark\" or \"bugger this for a game of soldiers\".\n\nAs an interjection, \"bugger\" is sometimes used as a single-word expletive. \"Buggeration\" is a derivation occasionally found in British English.\n\nAs with many expletives, its continued use has reduced its shock value and offensiveness. Thus the Toyota car company in Australia and New Zealand ran a popular series of advertisements where \"Bugger!\" was the only spoken word (with exception of an utterance of \"bugger me!\") (frequently repeated); they then ran a censored version of the ad in which \"Bugger!\" was bleeped out, as a joke against those who spoke out against the ad claiming it was offensive. The term is generally not used in the United States, but it is recognised, although inoffensive there. It is also used in Canada more frequently than in the United States but with less stigma than in other parts of the world. In the pre-watershed television version of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" the opening sequence is modified from repeated exclamations of \"Fuck!\" by Hugh Grant and Charlotte Coleman when they are late for the first wedding to repeated exclamations of \"Bugger!\".\n\n\"Bagarap\" (from \"buggered up\") is a common word in Pacific pidgins such as Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea, Brokan (Torres Strait Creole) of Australia and Papua and others, meaning \"broken\", \"hurt\", \"ruined\", \"destroyed\", \"tired\", and so on, as in Tok Pisin \"kanu i bagarap\", Brokan \"kenu i bagarap\", \"the canoe is broken\" or Tok Pisin/Brokan \"kaikai i bagarap\", \"the food is spoiled.\" Tok Pisin \"mi bagarap pinis\" (\"me bugger-up finish\") means, \"I am very tired,\" or \"I am very ill\", while the Brokan equivalent, \"ai pinis bagarap\" is more \"I'm done in\", \"I'm finished/I've had it\". The term was put to use in the album \"Bagarap Empires\" by Fred Smith, which was made to capture the peace process in Bougainville, an island province of Papua New Guinea; in a number of the songs he uses Melanesian pidgin, the language used in Bougainville and elsewhere.\n\nChildren, a term so familiar in the United Kingdom that there is a series of professional teaching manuals with titles that start \"Getting the buggers to ...\"\n\nTo mess around, to do something ineffectively.\n\nBugger all means \"nothing\" as in \"You may not like paying taxes, but there's bugger all you can do about it.\" and \"The police are doing bugger all about all this aggro that's going on\" See also \"fuck all\", \"sweet FA\", and \"Llareggub\".\n\nThe phrase \"bugger me\" is a slang term used for a situation that has yielded an unexpected or undesirable result.\n\nCommon usage includes \"bugger me dead\" and \"bugger me blind\".\n\nColloquial military term for a disorderly group—either assembled without formation or in a formation that does not meet the standards of the commentator: \"just form a bugger's muddle\", \"there's a bugger's muddle of civvies hanging around the gate\", \"Get that bugger's muddle of yours fallen in properly\".\n\nThe phrase \"bugger off\" is a slang or dismissive term meaning \"leave\".\n\nThe word \"buggery\" today also serves as a general expletive (mild, moderate or severe depending on the context and company), and can be used to replace the word \"bugger\" as a simple expletive or as a simile in phrases which do not actually refer literally in any sense to buggery itself, but just use the word for its informal strength of impact, e.g., \"Run like buggery\", which is equivalent to \"Run like hell\" but would be regarded by most listeners as more obscene.\n\n\nNotes\n"}
{"id": "588308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588308", "title": "Faxlore", "text": "Faxlore\n\nFaxlore is a sort of folklore: humorous texts, folk poetry, folk art, and urban legends that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by fax machine. Xeroxlore or photocopylore is similar material circulated by photocopying; compare samizdat in Soviet-bloc countries.\n\nThe first use of the term xeroxlore was in Michael J. Preston's essay \"Xerox-lore\", 1974. \"Photocopylore\" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of trademark concerns involving the Xerox Corporation. The first use of this term came in \"A Dictionary of English Folklore\" by Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud.\n\nSome faxlore is relatively harmless. Cartoons and jokes often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of technology owned by the employer, much humorous faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values. Like email and chain letters, office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, urban legends, and folklore. The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on. Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.\n\nThe semi-traditional lists of reasons \"why a cucumber is better than a man\" or \"why a beer is better than a woman\" often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known mock German variations of the \"Blinkenlights\" poster. Another commonly circulated text contains ethnic humor; a typical version goes:\n\nMaterials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies. World War II era blueprints exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes. With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base. Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of managerial restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of copyright law.\n\nLater, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely. The use of a fax machine to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines. This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by email as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as email hoaxes. Specific computer related alarms are the subject of virus hoaxes; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.\n\nOther sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences. A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious \"Blue Star Acid\" hoax is one well known example.\n\nThe \"lights out\" hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for murder as part of a gang initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore. The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant city, only made these hoaxes seem more credible.\n\nIn the United States, collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among school administrators and police departments; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be \"Satanic symbols\", and in the 1990s they were alleged to be \"gang symbols\". Political or religious symbols, like the peace symbol, the Star of David, the Rosary, the ankh, or the pentagram were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.\n\nOn the authority of these anonymous, hard to trace, and impossible to cross-examine sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions. Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their \"secret meaning.\" A number of civil liberties lawsuits were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.\n\nA similar claim that the Procter & Gamble logo was a \"satanic symbol\" was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several Amway distributors, Amway being one of Procter & Gamble's competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by voice mail and email. Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various universities or sports teams are \"gang symbols\".\n\nWith the rise of the Internet, media such as World Wide Web, email, instant messaging, and social networking sites are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible computer viruses that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus cautionary tale that used to circulate as faxlore.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "588652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588652", "title": "Chylomicron", "text": "Chylomicron\n\nChylomicrons (from the Greek χυλός, chylos, meaning \"juice\" (of plants or animals), and micron, meaning \"small particle\") are lipoprotein particles that consist of triglycerides (85–92%), phospholipids (6–12%), cholesterol (1–3%), and proteins (1–2%).\nThey transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body. Chylomicrons are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins: chylomicrons (a.k.a. ULDL ultra low-density lipoprotein relative to surrounding water), very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream.\n\nChylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle tissue, where their triglyceride components are hydrolyzed by the activity of the lipoprotein lipase, allowing the released free fatty acids to be absorbed by the tissues. When a large portion of the triacylglycerol core have been hydrolyzed, chylomicron remnants are formed and are taken up by the liver, thereby also transferring dietary fat to the liver.\n\nChylomicrons are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absorptive cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine. The villi, lined with the microvilli of the brush border, provide a lot of surface area for absorption. Newly formed chylomicrons are secreted through the basolateral membrane into the lacteals, where they join lymph to become chyle. The lymphatic vessels carry the chyle to the venous return of the systemic circulation. From there the chylomicrons supply the tissue with fat absorbed from the diet. Thus, unlike the saccharides and amino acids that digestion liberates from the carbohydrates and proteins of the diet (respectively), the lipids from the diet bypass the hepatic portal system, meaning the liver does not get \"first crack\" at them.\n\nThere are three stages in the chylomicron's \"lifecycle\":\n\nTriglycerides are emulsified by bile and hydrolyzed by the enzyme lipase, resulting in a mixture of fatty acids and monoglycerides. These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte, where they are re-esterified to form triglycerides. The triglycerides are then combined with phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and apolipoprotein B-48 to form a nascent chylomicron. These are then released by exocytosis from the enterocytes into the lacteals, lymphatic vessels originating in the villi of the small intestine, and are then secreted into the bloodstream at the thoracic duct's connection with the left subclavian vein.\n\nNascent chylomicrons are composed primarily of triglycerides (85%) and contain some cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. The main apolipoprotein component is apolipoprotein B-48 (apo B-48).\n\nWhile circulating in blood, chylomicrons exchange components with high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The HDL donates apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) to the nascent chylomicron and, thus, converts it to a mature chylomicron (often referred to simply as \"chylomicron\"). APOC2 is the coenzyme for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.\n\nOnce triglyceride stores are distributed, the chylomicron returns APOC2 to the HDL (but keeps APOE), and, thus, becomes a chylomicron remnant, now only 30–50 nm. APOB48 and APOE are important to identify the chylomicron remnant in the liver for endocytosis and breakdown.\n"}

T. Achaya, the earliest extant mention of sambar in literature can be dated to the 17th century.\n\nSambar is made either exclusively with one of these vegetables or a combination of them:\n\nSambar often contains sambar powder, a coarse spice mix made of roasted lentils, dried whole red chilies, fenugreek seeds, coriander seeds and sometimes asafoetida and curry leaves. Regional variations include cumin, black pepper, grated coconut, cinnamon, or other spices.\n\nThe vegetables, tamarind pulp, sambar powder, turmeric, salt, and asafoetida are boiled together until the vegetables are half-cooked. Then the cooked lentils (most often the split pigeon pea) are added and allowed to cook until the vegetables are done. A spice-scented oil is added to the cooked sambar for extra flavor and tempering, and the dish is served garnished with fresh coriander leaves or curry leaves.\n\nThe addition of spice-scented oils, made by popping mustard seeds and other ingredients in hot vegetable oil, at the end of cooking is a common Indian culinary technique and is known as tempering. A combination of mustard seeds, black gram, dried red chillies, and curry leaves fried in ghee or vegetable oil is one example of numerous oil flavourings used for sambar. Some variations include additional ingredients such as cumin seeds, shallots, fenugreek seeds and asafoetida powder.\n\nThis lentils and multi vegetables combination is a very healthy dish and is served hot with cooked rice or many of the South Indian preparations like idli, dosa, medu-wada, etc. \n\nSome variations of sambhar include ingredients such as moong dal and pumpkin.\n\nSambar is reflective of a broad and ancient tradition of lentil-based vegetable stews in southern India. In regions that grow coconuts, notably some areas of Tamil Nadu, coastal Karnataka and Kerala, Sambar is made with a paste of fresh, grated or roasted coconuts and spices, instead of sambar powder.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, it is called as \"Pappu chaaru\". Apart from dal and tamarind, vegetables used in preparing is few. Vegetables are onions, dosakaaya, bitter gourd and tomatoes. \n\nSambar without lentils (but with vegetables, or dried or fresh fish, or meat) is called kuzhambu in Tamil Nadu.\n\nSambar is usually served with steamed rice as one of the main courses of both formal and everyday south Indian cuisine.

{"id": "590260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590260", "title": "Arak (drink)", "text": "Arak (drink)\n\nArak or araq () is a West Asian distilled spirit (≈40–63% alc/vol or ≈80–126 proof) in the anise drinks family. It is a translucent white unsweetened anise-flavored drink, which is traditionally made of only two ingredients, grapes and aniseed. Aniseeds are the seeds of the anise plant, and when crushed, their oil provides Arak with a slight licorice taste. Arak is the traditional alcoholic beverage in Western Asia, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well in Iraq, Syria, Israel, Jordan, Iran, Armenia and Lebanon.\n\nThe word arak comes from Arabic \"\" , meaning 'perspiration'.\n\nIts pronunciation varies depending on local varieties of Arabic: , . Arak is not to be confused with the similarly named liquor, arrack (which in some cases, such as in Indonesia—especially Bali, also goes by the name arak). Another similar-sounding word is \"aragh\", which in Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia is the colloquial name of vodka, and not an aniseed-flavored drink. Rakı, mastika, and ouzo are aniseed-flavored alcoholic drinks, related to arak, popular in Turkey, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Greece respectively.\n\nArak is usually mixed in proportions of approximately one third arak and two thirds water in a traditional Eastern Mediterranean water vessel called \"Abarik\", Arabic \"abarīq\" ; then the mixture is poured into small, ice-filled cups. This dilution causes the clear liquor to turn a translucent milky-white color; this is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is soluble in alcohol but not in water. This results in an emulsion, whose fine droplets scatter the light and turn the liquid translucent, a phenomenon known as louching. Arak is commonly served with mezza, which may include dozens of small traditional dishes. In general, arak drinkers prefer to consume it this way, rather than alone. It is also consumed with raw meat dishes or barbecues, along with garlic sauce.\n\nIf ice is added after pouring it into the cup, this results in the formation of an aesthetically unpleasant layer on the surface of the drink, because the ice causes the oils to solidify. If water is added first, the ethanol causes the fat to emulsify, leading to the characteristic milky color. To avoid the precipitation of the anise (instead of emulsion), drinkers prefer not to reuse an arak-filled glass. In restaurants, when a bottle of arak is ordered, the waiter will usually bring a number of glasses along with it for this reason.\n\nIn cocktails and other mixed drinks, Arak is usually mixed with a citrus-based juice, such as lemon, orange, or white grapefruit, to compliment the natural flavor of the Arak.\n\nDistillation begins with the vineyards, and quality grapevines are the key to making good arak. The vines should be very mature and usually of a golden color. Instead of being irrigated, the vineyards are left to the care of the Mediterranean climate and make use of the natural rain and sun. The grapes, which are harvested in late September and October, are crushed and put in barrels together with the juice (in Arabic \"el romeli\") and left to ferment for three weeks. Occasionally the whole mix is stirred to release the CO.\n\nNumerous stills exist including stainless steel or copper, pot and column stills that will affect the final taste and specificity of the arak. The authentic copper stills with a Moorish shape are the most sought after.\n\nThe finished product is made during the second distillation. The alcohol collected in the first distillation is distilled again but this time it is mixed with aniseed. The ratio of alcohol to aniseed may vary and it is one of the major factors in the quality of the final product. Another distillation takes place, usually on the lowest possible temperature.\n\nFor a quality arak, the finished spirit is aged in clay amphoras to allow the angel's share to evaporate and thus the remaining liquid is the most suitable for consumption.\n\n"}

This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. \nA decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand for another good, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. \n\nWhen two goods are complements, they experience joint demand. For example, the demand for razor blades may depend upon the number of razors in use; this is why razors have sometimes been sold as loss leaders, to increase demand for the associated blades.\n\nRecent work in food consumption has elucidated the psychological processes by which the consumption of one good (e.g., cola) stimulates demand for its complements (e.g., a cheeseburger, pizza, etc.). Consumption of a food or beverage activates a goal to consume its complements: foods that consumers believe would produce super-additive utility (i.e., would taste better together). Eating peanut-butter covered crackers, for instance, increases the consumption of grape-jelly covered crackers more than eating plain crackers. Drinking cola increases consumers' willingness to pay for a voucher for a cheeseburger. This effect appears to be contingent on consumers' perceptions of what foods are complements rather than their sensory properties.\n\nAn example of this would be the demand for cars and petrol. The supply and demand of cars is represented by the figure at the right with the initial demand D1. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by P1 with a quantity demanded of Q1. If the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity of cars demanded. This higher quantity demanded would cause the demand curve to shift rightward to a new position D2. Assuming a constant supply curve S of cars, the new increased quantity demanded will be at D2 with a new increased price P2. Other examples include automobiles and fuel, mobile phones and cellular service, printer and cartridge, among others.\n\nA perfect complement is a good that \"has\" to be consumed with another good. The indifference curve of a perfect complement will exhibit a right angle, as illustrated by the figure at the right. Such preferences are often represented by a Leontief utility function.\n\nFew goods in the real world will behave as perfect complements. One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are naturally sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1, even if, for example, someone is missing a leg and buys just one shoe.\n\nThe degree of complementarity, however, does not have to be mutual; it can be measured by the cross price elasticity of demand. In the case of video games, a specific video game (the complement good) has to be consumed with a video game console (the base good). It does not work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game.\n\nA classic example of mutually perfect complements is the case of pencils and erasers. Imagine an accountant who will need to prepare financial statements, but in doing so must use pencils to make all calculations and erasers to correct errors. The accountant knows that for every three pencils, one eraser will be needed. Any more pencils will serve no purpose, because they will not be able to erase the calculations. Any more erasers will not be useful either, because there will not be enough pencils for them to make a large enough mess with in order to require more erasers.\n\nIn this case the utility would be given by an increasing function of:\n\nIn marketing, complementary goods give additional market power to the company. It allows vendor lock-in as it increases the switching cost. A few types of pricing strategy exist for a complementary good and its base good:\n\n"}

It exists in various forms throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. Beef noodle soup was first created by the Hui people during the Tang Dynasty and is commonly known as Lanzhou beef noodle soup. The Sichuan beef noodle soup or Red-braised beef noodle soup (紅燒牛肉麵) is a dish from Sichuan as a variation of the original Hui dish. The dish was introduced to Taiwan by Sichaunese Kuomintang veterans who fled to the island during the Chinese Civil War and in the West is commonly known as Taiwanese beef noodle soup.\n\nIn overseas Chinese communities in North America, this food can be found in Chinese and Taiwanese restaurants. In Mainland China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish. In Taiwan, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.\n\nBeef noodles are often served as fast food in mainland China, with Mr. Lee being the largest chain. In Taiwan, it is sometimes considered a national dish and every year Taipei holds an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where various chefs and restaurants compete for the title of the \"best beef noodles in Taiwan\". Due to influences from the influx of out of province Chinese from mainland China in the early 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan.\n\nIn Chinese, \"\" literally means \"beef noodles\". Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong restaurants may have a tendency to distinguish between \"\" \"beef noodles\" and \"\" \"beef brisket noodles\", with the former containing either beef shank or beef slices and the latter containing only brisket. It is sometimes served with wontons. In Taiwan, \"\" typically consists of either brisket or shank only, though many restaurants also have tendon or a more expensive option with both meat and tendon () and occasionally with tripe; , usually denotes a bowl containing all three. If one orders \"\" or \"beef soup noodles\" in a restaurant in Taiwan, Mainland China or Hong Kong, they might be given a cheaper bowl of noodles in only beef broth but no beef. If one orders a \"\" or \"beef-soup\", they could be given a more expensive bowl of beef broth with chunks of beef in it but without noodles. In Tainan, beef soup () denotes a distinct and local specialty, where sliced beef is blanched in hot soup and accompanied by shredded ginger.\nThere are two common variations of beef noodle which differ in the way the broth is prepared: Braised beef noodle soup and clear broth beef noodle soup.\n\nThe Chinese Muslim style of beef noodle is also known as clear-broth or consommé-stewed beef noodle (). It often uses halal (or \"qingzhen\") meat and contains no soy sauce, resulting in a lighter taste that may be flavoured by salt and herbs. Local lore attributes its creation with a Hui Chinese man from Lanzhou named Ma Baozi. In Lanzhou, Gansu, Lanzhou Beef Lamian () is usually served with clear soup and one hand-pulled lamian noodle per bowl. In halal restaurants, only quality local beef from the Southern Yellow cattle () prepared by the local halal butcher is used for the beef noodle. Chinese radish and the specially cooked spicy oil are also indispensable partners to Lanzhou Beaf noodles. Together with hand-pulled noodle, clear soup and herbs, they are called \"Yi Qing Er Bai San Huang Si Lv\". \"Yi Qing\" means something clear, which is the soup. \"Er Bai\" means something white, which is Chinese radish. \"San Huang\" means something yellow, which is the hand-pulled noodle. \"Si Lv\" means something greed, which is the herb.\n\nWhen soy sauce is added, the soup is called red roasted or braised beef noodles (). Braised beef noodle soup was reportedly invented in Sichuan as a variation of the Hui Muslim beef noodle soup due to large amounts of migration into the province. This type of beef noodle soup tends to be spicy, as garlic, chili oil, doubanjiang or five-spice powder may be added - classic flavor elements of Sichuan cuisine. It is sometimes referred to as \"Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup\" (), especially in Taiwan. The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the stock simmer for long periods with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. The dish can be found all across Sichuan province, particularly in the capital of Chengdu and also overseas as is the case in American Sichuanese restaurants.\n\nThe dish was introduced to Taiwan by Kuomintang Sichuan province veterans who fled from mainland China to Kaohsiung, Taiwan and served in military dependents' villages (which had a distinct cuisine from the rest of Taiwan). The Taiwanese traditionally had an aversion to the consumption of beef even into the mid-1970s because cattle were valuable beasts of burden so originally the dish was only eaten by the mainland Chinese. However, the dish became more accepted over time and is now one of Taiwan’s most popular foods. It is believed that the popularity of this noodle soup broke the beef-eating taboo and also paved the way to Taiwan later embracing American foods that utilized beef (such as hamburgers). The Taiwanese variation is significantly less spicy than it's Sichuanese predecessor and there are several variations with the soy-based broth, such as tomato, garlic and herbal medicine. The tomato variation () is popular in Taiwan and features chunks of tomatoes in a rich red-coloured tomato broth with or without soy sauce. The herbal medicine variation is usually served without suancai as a topping (as its acidic properties are believed to inhibit medicinal properties) and may be accompanied by a chili paste made from beef lard.\n\nIn Thailand, \"kuaitiao nuea pueay\" is a similar dish. In Vietnam, \"Bò Kho\" is a beef stew sometimes served with noodles (or bread as an alternative), that is similar to Taiwanese braised beef noodles. Pho is also a Vietnamese noodle soup that contains of broth, rice noodles called bánh phở, herbs, and meat, primarily made with either beef (phở bò) or chicken (phở gà).\n\nYaka mein is a type of beef noodle soup commonly found in Chinese restaurants in New Orleans. It consists of stewed beef, spaghetti noodles, hard-boiled egg and chopped green onions, with Cajun seasoning, chili powder or Old Bay-brand seasoning.\n\n"}

Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it \"Easter soup\", \"Easter Sunday soup\", or \"Easter lamb soup\". In some parts of Greece, most notably Thessaly, it is not served as soup but rather as a fricassee, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup.\n\nMagiritsa is eaten to break the fast of the Greek Orthodox Great Lent, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa consists of the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared on Holy Saturday along with the next day's lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the midnight Divine Liturgy.\n\nWhile traditional magiritsa includes all the lamb offal available, it is the head and neck of the lamb which provide most of the soup's flavor, and those parts, along with the intestines, heart, and liver, are most commonly used today.\n\nAfter a thorough cleaning, the lamb parts are boiled whole in water for between thirty minutes and two hours, then cut up into smaller pieces, flavored with onions, dill, butter and sometimes vegetables, and left to simmer.

It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in ice cream, hot cocoa, and baking.\n\nThe Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker Coenraad Johannes van Houten, whose father Casparus is responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cacao beans by hydraulic press around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder. These developments greatly expanded the use of chocolate, which had been mostly used as a beverage in Europe until that time.\n\nDutch processed cocoa has a neutral pH, and is not acidic like natural cocoa, so in recipes that use baking soda as the leavening agent—which relies on the acidity of the cocoa to activate it—buttermilk, yoghurt or sour milk should be substituted for the milk in the recipe, or a dash of cream of tartar can be used to provide some acidity in the batter. There is no need to add acidity when Dutch process cocoa is used in recipes that use baking powder instead of soda (UK: \"bicarb\") for leavening.\n\nThe Dutch process:\n\nCompared to other processes, Dutch process chocolate contains lower amounts of flavonols (antioxidants).

One study determined that 60% of natural cocoa's original antioxidants were destroyed by light dutching and 90% were destroyed by heavy dutching. A new study found \"...protection against synaptic deficits by Lavado cocoa extract, but not Dutched cocoa extract... since much of the polyphenol content is lost by the high alkalinity in the Dutching process.\" However, natural cocoa has such high levels of antioxidants that even a 60% reduction leaves it high on the list of antioxidant-rich foods.\n\n"}

Some recipes call for sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are often baked on edible rice paper placed on a baking tray.\n\nThe name of the cake comes from the Italian \"maccarone\" or \"maccherone\" meaning \"paste\", referring to the original almond paste ingredient; this word itself derives from \"ammaccare\", meaning \"to crush\".\n\nCulinary historians write that macaroons can be traced to an Italian monastery of the 8th or 9th century. The monks came to France in 1533, joined by the pastry chefs of Catherine de Medici, wife of King Henri II. Later, two Benedictine nuns, Sister Marguerite and Sister Marie-Elisabeth, came to Nancy seeking asylum during the French Revolution. The two women paid for their housing by baking and selling macaroon cookies, and thus became known as the \"Macaroon Sisters\".\n\nItalian Jews later adopted the cookie because it has no flour or leavening (macaroons are leavened by egg whites) and can be eaten during the eight-day observation of Passover. It was introduced to other European Jews and became popular as a year-round sweet.\n\nRecipes for macaroons (also spelled \"mackaroon\", \"maccaroon\" and \"mackaroom\") appear in recipe books at least as early as 1725 (Robert Smith's \"Court Cookery, or the Complete English Cook\"), and use egg whites and almond paste. \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" includes a typical traditional recipe. Over time, coconut was added to the ground almonds and, in certain recipes, replaced them. Potato starch is also sometimes included in the recipe, to give the macaroons more body.\n\nMacaroons in the Dominican Republic are very dark. Grated coconut is mixed with ginger and cinnamon.\n\nThe coconut macaroon is known as the \"\", or \"\"le rocher à la noix de coco\"\".\n\nThoothukudi and Mangalore have their own varieties of macaroon made with cashews and egg whites, adapted from those introduced in colonial times.\n\nA macaroon chocolate bar is made by Wilton Candy in Co. Kildare, Ireland. The description on the packaging is \"macaroon pieces in Irish milk chocolate.\" It was first made in 1937. Cleeve's Irish Confectionery also make a macaroon chocolate bar - ingredients include cocoa butter, milk powder and desiccated coconut.\n\nRicciarelli are a soft almond variety originating from Siena. Amaretti di Saronno are a usually crunchy variety from Saronno.\n\nBoth are often served on special occasions such as Christmas.\n\nPhilippine coconut macaroons are uniquely cake-like in texture. They are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft, moist, and chewy on the inside. They are usually baked into colorful tiny cupcake wrappers and topped with a raisin. They are popular during holidays and special occasions.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, coconut macaroons are called \"besitos de coco\" (little coconut kisses). A few variations of \"besitos de coco\" can be found on the island, the most popular ones including lemon zest and vanilla as additional ingredients.\n\nMacaroon chocolate bars are also popular in Scotland. Buchanan's make a macaroon with Belgian chocolate and toasted coconut. They are a long-established family business based in Greenock.\nThe \"carajito\" is a macaroon variant made with hazelnuts and honey from the town of Salas, Asturias in northern Spain. A larger size version is commonly known as \"sultana\" or \"suspiros del moro\".\n\nAcıbadem kurabiyesi is a traditional Turkish variety made of almonds, sugar and egg whites. The traditional recipes include a small amount of bitter almonds, which gives this cookie its name. Because bitter almonds are not readily available, almond extract is typically used as a substitute. These cookies are part of the stock-in trade of almost every bakery in Turkey, as they are seldom made at home.\n\nIn Britain generally, the traditional almond macaroon often includes almond essence to strengthen the flavour, and is topped with an almond flake. Coconut macaroons are also popular.\nIn Scotland, the Scottish macaroon has a dense, sugary centre and is covered in chocolate and roasted coconut. Traditionally they were made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the macaroon bar became commercial the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf life limitations. The modern macaroon is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees was said to have botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first macaroon bar.\n\nCoconut macaroon is the best known variety in America. Commercially made coconut macaroons are generally dense, moist and sweet, and often dipped in chocolate. Homemade macaroons and varieties produced by smaller bakeries are commonly light and fluffy. Macaroons made with coconuts are often piped out with a star shaped tip, whereas macaroons made with nuts are more likely shaped individually due to the stiffness of the dough. Because of their lack of wheat and leavening ingredients, macaroons are often consumed during Passover in many Jewish homes.\n\n\n"}

Range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, and the battery power of the DPV. Time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice. DPVs have recreational, scientific and military applications.\n\nDPVs include a range of configurations from small, easily portable scooter units with a small range and low speed, to faired or enclosed units capable of carrying several divers longer distances at higher speeds.\n\nThe earliest recorded DPVs were used for military purposes during World War II, and were based on torpedo technology and components.\n\nA DPV usually consists of a pressure-resistant watertight casing containing a battery-powered electric motor, which drives a propeller. The design must ensure that the propeller cannot harm the diver, diving equipment or marine life, the vehicle cannot be accidentally started or run away from the diver, and it remains neutrally buoyant while in use underwater.\n\nDPVs are useful for extending the range of an autonomous diver that is otherwise restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, which is increased by exertion, diver fatigue, and the time limits imposed by decompression obligation, which depend on the dive profile. Typical uses include cave diving and technical diving where the vehicles help move bulky equipment and make better use of the limited underwater time imposed by the decompression requirements of deep diving. Military applications include delivery of combat divers and their equipment over distances or at speeds that would be otherwise impracticable.\nThere are accessories that can be mounted to a DPV to make it more useful. Equipment such as lights, compasses, cameras, lobster sticks and even spearguns can also be mounted to DPVs.\n\nDPV operation requires greater situational awareness than simply swimming. Operating a DPV requires simultaneous depth control, buoyancy adjustment, monitoring of breathing gas, and navigation. Buoyancy control is vital for diver safety: The DPV has the capacity to dynamically compensate for poor buoyancy control by thrust vectoring while moving, but on stopping the diver may turn out to be dangerously positively or negatively buoyant if adjustments were not made to suit the changes in depth while moving. If the diver does not control the DPV properly, a rapid ascent or descent under power can result in barotrauma or decompression sickness. High speed travel in confined spaces, or limited visibility can increase the risk of impact with the surroundings at speeds where injury and damage are more likely.\nMany forms of smaller marine life are very well camouflaged or hide well and are only seen by divers who move very slowly and look carefully. Fast movement and noise can frighten some fish into hiding or swimming away, and the DPV is bulky and affects precise maneuvering at close quarters. The DPV occupies at least one hand while in use and may get in the way while performing precision work like macro photography.\nSince the diver is not kicking for propulsion, they will generally get colder due to lower physical activity and increased water flow. This can be compensated by appropriate thermal insulation.\nIf the operation of the DPV is critical to exit from a long penetration dive, it is necessary to allow for alternative propulsion in case of a breakdown to ensure safe exit before the breathing gas runs out.\n\nHuman torpedoes or manned torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later Britain, deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbours.\nThe first human torpedo was the Italian \"Maiale\" (\"Pig\"). In operation, it was carried by another vessel (usually a normal submarine), and launched near the target. It was electrically propelled, with two crewmen in diving suits and rebreathers riding astride. They steered the torpedo at slow speed to the target, used the detachable warhead as a limpet mine and then rode the torpedo away.\n\nThe idea was successfully applied by the Italian navy (\"Regia Marina\") early in World War II and then copied by the British when they discovered how effective this weapon could be was after three Italian units successfully penetrated the harbour of Alexandria and damaged the two British battleships and , and the tanker \"Sagona.\" The official Italian name for their craft was \"Siluro a Lenta Corsa\" (SLC or \"Slow-running torpedo\"), but the Italian operators nicknamed it \"Maiale\" after their inventor Teseo Tesei angrily called it a pig when it had been difficult to steer. The British versions were named \"chariots\".\nThe Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC), nicknamed \"Sleeping Beauty\", was built by British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II as an underwater vehicle for a single frogman to perform clandestine reconnaissance or attacks against enemy vessels.\n\nThe most common type of DPV tows the diver who holds onto handles on the stern or bow. Tow-behind scooters are most efficient by placing the diver parallel to and above the propeller wash. The diver wears a harness that includes a crotch-strap with a D-ring on the front of the strap. The scooter is rigged with a tow leash that clips to the scooter with releasable metal snap.\n\nSwimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) are wet subs designed to transport frogmen from a combat swimmer unit or naval Special Forces underwater, over long distances. SDVs carry a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, and combat swimmer team and their equipment, to and from maritime mission objectives on land or at sea. The pilot and co-pilot are often a part of the swimmer team. An example of a modern SDV in use today is the SEAL Delivery Vehicle used by the United States Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service.\n\nFor long-range missions, SDVs can carry their own onboard breathing gas supply to extend the range of the swimmer's scuba equipment.\n\nSDVs are typically used to land special operations forces or plant limpet mines on the hull of enemy ships. In the former usage, they can land a combat swimmer team covertly on a hostile shore in order to conduct missions on land. After completing their mission, the team may return to the SDV to exfiltrate back to the mother-ship. For extended missions on land, a team can be re-supplied by contact with other SDVs. In the latter usage, SDVs can stealthily plant mines and other bombs on ships or port infrastructure and then retreat to a safe distance before detonating the explosives. In addition to destroying targets, the SDV can mislead enemies as to where they are being attacked from. One type of SDV—the Mark 9 SEAL Delivery Vehicle—was also capable of firing torpedoes, giving it the standoff ability to attack from up to away.\n\nThe origins of the SDV stems from the Italian human torpedoes and the British Motorised Submersible Canoe used during World War II.\n\nThese are torpedo or fish-shaped vehicles for one or more divers typically sitting astride them or in hollows inside. The human torpedo was used to great effect by commando frogmen in World War II, who were able to sink more than 100,000 tons worth of ships in the Mediterranean alone. Similar vehicles have been made for work divers or sport divers but better streamlined as these do not have warheads; the \"Dolphin\" made on the Isle of Wight (UK) in the 1971s is an example. Some Farallon and Aquazepp scooters are torpedo-shaped with handles near the bow and a raised seat at the rear to support the diver's crotch against the slipstream.\nThe Russian Protei-5 and Proton carry the diver attached to the top. The New Zealand made Proteus is strapped onto the diver's cylinder.\n\nThe Subskimmer is a submersible rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RIB). On the surface it is powered by a petrol engine, when submerged the petrol engine is sealed and it runs on battery-electric thrusters mounted on a steerable cross-arm. It can self inflate and deflate, transforming itself from a fast, light, surface boat to a submerged DPV. Started in the 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham, Northumberland, England, \"Subskimmer\" is now a tradename owned by Marine Specialised Technology.\n\nAs DPVs get bigger they gradually merge into submarines. A wet sub is a small submarine where the crew spaces are flooded at ambient pressure and the crew must wear diving gear. Covert military operations use wet subs to deliver and retrieve operators into harbors and near-shore undetected. An example is the Multi-Role Combatant Craft (MRCC).\n\nThese are unpowered boards (usually rectangular) towed by a surface boat which function as diving planes. The diver holds onto the sled and may use a quick-release tether to reduce fatigue. Depth control while submerged is by adjusting the angle of attack. Sometimes known as manta-boards, after the manta ray. Towed sleds are useful for surveys and searches in good visibility in waters where there are not too many large obstacles. The route is largely controlled by the towing vessel, but the diver has a limited amount of control over vertical and lateral excursions.\n\nDPVs currently in service include:\n\nDivehead 1070 and Divehead 1500 are two industrial grade DPVs, designed and developed by Lian Innovative in China. Divehead is intended to fill the gap between military grade and recreational DPVs.\n\nOne of the DPVs in Chinese service is developed by the Kunming Wuwei Science & Technology Trade Co., Ltd at Kunming, a solely owned subsidiary of Kunming 705th (Research) Institute Science & Technology Development Co. (昆明七零五所科技发展总公司)) at Kunming, which in turn, is a company wholly owned by the 705th Research Institute (headquartered in Xi'an) of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. A total of 4 DPV models have been identified in Chinese naval service:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the DPVs currently in the Chinese naval inventory, Glory International Group Ltd in Beijing is also marketing two of its DPVs, (GL602 and GL603), to the Chinese military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwedish firm Defence Consulting Europe Aktiebolag (stock company, often abbreviated as DCE AB) has developed a family of SDV of modular design, all of them based on the same basic frame and general design principle, and current available versions include:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter purchasing US submersible manufacturer Seahorse Marine, Emirate Marine Technologies of United Arab Emirates has developed four classes DPV/SDV, all of them built of glass reinforced plastic and carbon composite materials:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll SDVs of former Yugoslavia were developed by Brodosplit - Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata d.o.o. which have been passed on to successor nations of former Yugoslavia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "596114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596114", "title": "Grey Goose (vodka)", "text": "Grey Goose (vodka)\n\nGrey Goose is a brand of vodka produced in France. It was created in the 1990s by Sidney Frank, who sold it in 2004 to Bacardi. The \"Maître de Chai\" for Grey Goose is François Thibault, who developed the original recipe for the vodka in Cognac, France.\n\nGrey Goose was created by Sidney Frank Importing Co (SFIC). Sidney Frank, founder/CEO of the company, developed the idea in the summer of 1996. The idea for Grey Goose was to develop a luxury vodka for the American marketplace. SFIC partnered with cognac producer François Thibault (a French \"Maître de Chai\", or, Cellar Master) in France in order to transition his skills from cognac to vodka production.\n\nThe company selected France due to the country's culinary history and to differentiate itself from other vodkas produced in Eastern Europe. The water used to produce the vodka came from natural springs in France filtered through Champagne limestone, and made with locally produced French wheat. The company also developed its distinctive smoked glass bottle featuring French geese in flight, and delivered its product in wooden crates similar to wine.\n\nIn 1998 Grey Goose was named the best-tasting vodka in the world by the Beverage Testing Institute. The company was eventually sold to Bacardi for US$2.2 billion in August 2004. That year Grey Goose was the best-selling premium brand vodka in the United States. The company sold more than 1.5 million cases that year.\n\nEconomist Thomas J. Stanley discusses Grey Goose in his book \"Stop Acting Rich\" (2009). Based on extensive research and surveys, Stanley describes Grey Goose as a favorite beverage of Americans he terms \"aspirationals\" (i.e., \"those who wish to act rich\", regardless of actual income or wealth, and thus spend large amounts of income on status items). Grey Goose costs up to four or five times more than most competing vodka brands and did not reach the top 10 in a 2005 taste test of vodka brands published in \"The New York Times\", yet has still seen \"explosive sales growth\" in a few short years due in large part to its being perceived as a drink of the economic elite—even more so than items like Rolex wristwatches or Mercedes Benz automobiles.\n\nThe wheat used in the creation of Grey Goose vodka is grown in Picardy, France. Distilled in the same region, north and east of Paris, the distillate is then sent to Cognac, France, where it is blended with spring water and bottled. The wheat used in Grey Goose is soft winter wheat, sown in October and harvested in August, which provides it with four additional months of growth in comparison to summer wheat. The wheat sold to Grey Goose is categorized as \"superior bread-making wheat\", and wheat that is soft.\n\nEnzymes are used to break down the carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The fermentation takes place continuously over six cascading tanks, producing a 20-proof beer. The wash is then distilled into spirit using a five-step process. The water used in the vodka comes from a natural spring 150 meters (500 feet) below the blending facility in Cognac, which is lined with limestone, providing calcium-rich spring water. That water is then filtered to remove impurities. After the filtration the vodka is bottled in a plant dedicated solely to bottling Grey Goose. Grey Goose vodka is bottled with a replaceable cork rather than a screw-top cap.\n\nGrey Goose is the first vodka to be produced in the \"Maître de Chai\" tradition, which allows aromas to be produced in the distillation process specific to Grey Goose vodka. It is made from 100% French ingredients, including flavored versions of the vodka. For instance, Grey Goose La Poire was the result of Thibault's relationship with a Parisian pastry chef, whose pear tarte inspired the recipe for the new vodka flavor.\n\nGrey Goose Le Citron is a lemon-flavored vodka. Grey Goose Cherry Noir is a black cherry-flavored vodka, Grey Goose L'Orange is an orange-flavored vodka, and the once-retired, and back for a limited-time only, Grey Goose La Vanille tastes of vanilla, with hints of cinnamon and caramel. Grey Goose Le Melon, the latest flavored expression released in summer 2014 is made with Cavaillon melons from the Provence region of France. Thibault has stated that Grey Goose does not plan to expand its number of flavored vodkas extensively, in order to not deviate from the original taste. The company has sponsored Grey Goose Taste by Appointment events in which personal mixologists attempt to match Grey Goose cocktails to the taste profiles of patrons.\n\n"}

It was jointly invented in 1926 by Albert Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd, who patented it in the U.S. on November 11, 1930 ().\nThis is an alternative design from the original invention of 1922 by the Swedish inventors Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters.\n\nFrom 1926 until 1934 Einstein and Szilárd collaborated on ways to improve home refrigeration technology. The two were motivated by contemporary newspaper reports of a Berlin family who had been killed when a seal in their refrigerator failed and leaked toxic fumes into their home. Einstein and Szilárd proposed that a device without moving parts would eliminate the potential for seal failure, and explored practical applications for different refrigeration cycles. Einstein used the experience he had gained during his years at the Swiss Patent Office to apply for valid patents for their inventions in several countries. The two were eventually granted 45 patents in their names for three different models.\n\nIt has been suggested that most of the actual inventing was performed by Szilárd, with Einstein merely acting as a consultant and helping with the patent-related paperwork, but others assert Einstein labored over the project.\n\nThe refrigerator was not immediately put into commercial production; the most promising of their patents being quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux. Einstein and Szilard earned $750 (the equivalent of $10,000 today). A few demonstration units were constructed from other patents.\n\nIn September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled. A similar refrigeration device was proposed by Adam Grosser at a TED Talk in 2008, but has not made it into production as of 2015.\n\nIn 2016 Will Broadway won the James Dyson Award for a vaccine cooler based on the technology. Many vaccines require refrigeration to remain active, and the lack of infrastructure to maintain the \"cool chain\" to reliably bring vaccines into more remote areas of developing countries poses a serious challenge to national immunization programs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "599985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599985", "title": "Tab (drink)", "text": "Tab (drink)\n\nTab (stylized as TaB) is a diet cola soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola Company, introduced in 1963. Coca-Cola's first diet drink, Tab was notably popular throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and several variations were made, including a number of fruit-flavored, root beer, and ginger ale versions. Caffeine-free and clear variations were released in the late-1980s and early-1990s.\n\nFollowing studies in the early 1970s that linked saccharin, Tab's main sweetener, with bladder cancer in rats, the United States Congress mandated warning labels on products containing the sweetener. The label requirement was later repealed when no evidence was found linking saccharin with cancer in humans. \n\nTab's popularity declined after the Coca-Cola company's introduction of Diet Coke in 1982, though it remained the best-selling diet soda of that year. Coca-Cola continues to produce Tab in the United States, though in considerably smaller quantities than its more popular mainstay beverages, such as Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. According to the company, three million cases of Tab were made in 2011, and the beverage has retained a cult following over the years. In 2006, a Tab-branded energy drink was released, though it utilizes a different formula from the standard cola. \n\nTab was created in 1963 by Coca-Cola after the successful sales and marketing of Diet Rite cola, owned by The Royal Crown Company; previously, Diet Rite had been the only sugarless soda on the market. Tab was marketed to consumers who wanted to \"keep tabs\" on their weight.\n\nCoca-Cola's marketing research department used its IBM 1401 computer to generate a list of over 185,000 four-letter words with one vowel, adding names suggested by the company's own staff; the list was stripped of any words deemed unpronounceable or too similar to existing trademarks. Of a final list of about twenty names, \"Tabb\" was chosen, influenced by the possible play on words, and shortened to \"Tab\" during development. Packaging designer Robert Sidney Dickens gave the name the capitalization pattern (\"TaB\") used in the logo as well as creating a new bottle design for the soft drink.\n\nFor a time in the 1970s, Coca-Cola introduced six variety flavors of Tab (all of which were also sugar-free): Root Beer, Lemon-Lime, Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Strawberry, and Orange. A caffeine-free version of the original Tab flavor was introduced in 1983, alongside caffeine-free versions of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. Tab Clear, a caramel color-free version of Tab, was released in the United States in 1992, and subsequently in the United Kingdom and Japan. Tab Clear was discontinued in 1994.\n\nIn 2006, Coca-Cola introduced Tab Energy. Though it shares the Tab branding, its formula is entirely different from that of the standard cola: it is sweetened with sucralose, and has a sour, tart flavor.\n\nTab has been reformulated several times. It was initially sweetened with a mixture of cyclamate and saccharin. After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ban on cyclamate in 1969, sodium saccharin was used as the beverage's primary sweetener.\n\nStudies on laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked high volumes of cyclamate and saccharin with the development of bladder cancer. As a result, the United States Congress mandated that further studies of saccharin be performed and required that all food containing saccharin bear a label warning that the sweetener had been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Despite this, Tab remained commercially successful, and was the best-selling diet soda in 1982. In May 1984, Coca-Cola introduced Nutrasweet into the Tab formula, which maligned a significant portion of its market, and resulted in numerous consumer complaints regarding a perceived change in flavor.\n\nIn the absence of further evidence that saccharin caused cancer in humans, the substance was delisted in 2000 from the U.S. National Toxicology Program’s \"Report on Carcinogens\"; this led to the repealing of the warning label requirements for products containing saccharin. In December 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency removed saccharin from its list of hazardous substances.\n\nTab's popularity began to decline in 1982 with the introduction of Diet Coke, although Tab retained something of a cult following in the United States, where customers purchased about 3 million cases in 2008. In 2011, the Coca-Cola Company reported that they produced approximately 3 million cases of Tab that year (in contrast to the 885 million of Diet Coke). John Sicher, editor of \"Beverage Digest\", commented in 2013: \n\nThe product is also available in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Southern African Customs Union, Norway (Under the name Tab X-Tra), and Spain. \n\nTab was available in Australia in the 1960s to 1980s. It was also sold in the United Kingdom from the late 1970s to mid 1990s.\n\n"}

It is popular in a wide region of Central Europe (sometimes known under a different name with small variations) including southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Poland and Alsace. It is closely related to the Christmas cake in Italy known as the pandoro and to the American bundt cake. \nIn late Medieval Austria, a Gugelhupf was served at major community events such as weddings, and was decorated with flowers, leaves, candles, and seasonal fruits. The name persisted through the Austro-Hungarian Empire, eventually becoming standardized in Viennese cookbooks as a refined, rich cake, flavored with rosewater and almond. Many regional variations exist, testifying to the widespread popularity of the Gugelhupf tradition. Several narratives claim the origin of the cake in Roman times with a spurious claim relating even further back to the Three Wise Men. The cake was popularized as a prestige pastry by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and was popularized in France by Marie-Antoinette.\n\nThe Gugelhupf was the sweet chosen to represent Austria in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.\n\nThe old, South German name combines the Middle High German words \"Gugel\" (see also gugel, a long-pointed hood) derived from Latin \"cucullus\", meaning hood or bonnet, and \"Hupf\", which literally means \"to hop\" or \"to jump\". The Brothers Grimm wrote that the \"hupf\" may be a reference to the \"jumping\" of the dough caused by the yeast, but no firm etymological evidence exists for this. The earliest known Gugelhupf recipe, in Marx Rupolt's 1581 cookbook, describes a \"Hat Cake\" with the distinctive shape and ornamentation recommendation, suggesting a similarity or intentional imitation of the shape of a medieval hat.\n\nIt is spelled in Hungarian, (Cyrillic: ) in Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian, in Alsatian, in French and in Romanian. In Western Slovenia, it is also known as , and in Central and Eastern Slovenia, .\n\nIn Upper Austria it is known as \"Wacker\" or \"Wacka\". It is called in Czech and Slovak, and \"babka\" in Polish. In Slovenia, the standard word is .\n\nThe American Pennsylvania Dutch preserve the Gugelhupf tradition, referring to it as \"Dietscher Kuche\" (German Cake).\n\nGugelhupf is made with a soft yeast dough, baked in a high, creased, toroidal pan. Depending on the region it can contain raisins, almonds or sometimes also Kirschwasser cherry brandy. Some regional varieties (Czech, Hungarian and Slovak) are filled with a layer of sweetened ground poppy seeds. Sometimes a regular pound cake or a marble cake made without yeast but baked in a Gugelhupf pan is also called Gugelhupf.\n\nThe special circular pan with a central tube was originally made of enameled pottery.\n\nSimilar pans are used for making Bundt cakes, a cake baking pan shape in the US derived from the Gugelhupf.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "601094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601094", "title": "Korma", "text": "Korma\n\nKorma is a dish originating in the Indian subcontinent, consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt (dahi) or cream, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or glaze.\n\nThe English name is an anglicisation of Urdu , more accurately transliterated \"qormā\", and derived from a Turkic root. The word \"korma\" is derived from Urdu \"qormā\", \"ḳormā\" or \"ḳormah\", meaning \"braise\", and refers to the cooking technique used in the dish. All these words, and the names of dishes such as ghormeh (), the Azerbaijani qovurma or \"kavarma\" are ultimately derived from a Turkish language word \"qawirma\" meaning \"[a] fried thing\". The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.\n\nKorma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal incursions into the region. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with \"vark\", said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.\n\nClassically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt, cream or stock added. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on a mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as spinach and turnip. The term \"Shahi\" (), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.\n\nThe korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using a high heat, traditionally using ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid. The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called \"dum\" or \"dampokhtak\".\n\nThe korma can make use of a technique called \"bagar\": later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.\n\nThere is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring.\n\nA korma \"pilau\" (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.\n\nNavratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both. \"Navratan\" means nine gems, and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables.\n"}
