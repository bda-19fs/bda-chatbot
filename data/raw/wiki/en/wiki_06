The participants, who nicknamed themselves \"the committee\", included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won a national contest with the recipe. In Omaha, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.\n\n\nThe Montreal Reuben substitutes Montreal-style smoked meat for corned beef.\n\nThousand Island dressing is commonly used as a substitute for Russian dressing.\n\nThe walleye Reuben features the freshwater fish (\"Sander vitreus\") in place of the corned beef. It is eaten in Minnesota and Ohio.\n\nThe grouper Reuben is a variation on the standard Reuben sandwich, substituting grouper for the corned beef, and sometimes coleslaw for the sauerkraut as well. This variation is often a menu item in restaurants in Florida.\n\nReuben egg rolls, sometimes called \"Irish egg rolls\" or \"Reuben balls\", use the standard Reuben sandwich filling of corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese inside a deep-fried egg roll wrapper. Typically served with Thousand Island dressing (instead of Russian dressing) as an appetizer or snack, they originated at Mader's, a German restaurant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where chef Dennis Wegner created them for a summer festival circa 1990.\n\nThe Rachel sandwich is a variation on the standard Reuben sandwich, substituting pastrami for the corned beef, and coleslaw for the sauerkraut. Other recipes for the Rachel call for turkey instead of pastrami. In some parts of the United States, especially Michigan, this turkey variant is known as a \"Georgia Reuben\" or \"California Reuben\", and it may also call for barbecue sauce or French dressing instead of Russian dressing. The name may have originated from the 1871 song \"Reuben and Rachel\".\n\nVegetarian versions, called \"veggie Reubens\", omit the corned beef or substitute vegetarian ingredients for it, including zucchini, cucumbers, wheatmeat, mushrooms, tempeh, etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "320057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320057", "title": "Chartreuse (liqueur)", "text": "Chartreuse (liqueur)\n\nChartreuse () is a French liqueur available in both green and yellow versions that differ in both taste and alcohol content. The liqueur has been made by the Carthusian Monks since 1737 according to the instructions set out in a manuscript given to them by François Annibal d'Estrées in 1605. It was named after the monks' Grande Chartreuse monastery, located in the Chartreuse Mountains in the general region of Grenoble in France. The liqueur is produced in their distillery in the nearby town of Voiron (Isère). It is composed of distilled alcohol aged with 130 herbs, plants and flowers. It is one of the handful of liqueurs that continue to age and improve in the bottle.\n\nGreen Chartreuse (110 proof or 55% ABV) is a naturally green liqueur made from 130 herbs and other plants macerated in alcohol and steeped for about eight hours. A last maceration of plants gives its color to the liqueur.\n\nYellow Chartreuse (80 proof or 40%) has a milder and sweeter flavour and aroma than green Chartreuse, and is lower (albeit not low) in alcohol content.\n\nVEP stands for \"Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolongé\", meaning \"exceptionally prolonged aging\". It is made using the same processes and the same secret formula as the traditional liqueur, and by extra long aging in oak casks it reaches an exceptional quality. Chartreuse VEP comes in both yellow and green.\n\nÉlixir Végétal de la Grande-Chartreuse (138 proof or 69% – also 142 proof or 71%) has the same base of about 130 medicinal and aromatic plants and flowers but is more alcoholic. It can be described as a cordial or a liqueur, and is claimed to be a tonic. Sold in small wood-covered bottles.\n\nLiqueur du 9° Centenaire (47%) was created in 1984 to commemorate the 900 year anniversary of the foundation of the abbey. It is similar to Green Chartreuse, but slightly sweeter.\n\nChartreuse 1605 – Liqueur d'Elixir (56%) was created to commemorate the return of a mysterious manuscript concerning an elixir of long life to the Carthusian monks by Marshal François Annibal d'Estrées.\n\nWhite Chartreuse (30%) was produced and sold between 1860 and 1900.\n\nThe monks make a Génépi which is the general term in the Alps for a homemade or local liquor featuring local mountain flora. There are hundreds or even thousands of different Génépi liquors made, many simply by families for their own use each year. As they have been making Chartreuse from local plants for centuries, the monks started in the 2000s to make a Génépi as a sideline product. It is labelled \"Génépi des Pères Chartreux\" and is generally only available locally in a 70cl bottle, usually labelled 40% alcohol.\n\nIn 2007, a special edition was created by the \"Cuvée des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France\" Sommeliers (Best Craftsmen of France) in partnership with the distillery. It is yellow in color (40% alcohol).\n\nChartreuse has a very strong characteristic taste. It is very sweet, but becomes both spicy and pungent. It is comparable to other herbal liqueurs such as Galliano, Liquore Strega or Kräuterlikör, though it is distinctively more vegetal, or herbaceous. Like other liqueurs, its flavour is sensitive to serving temperature. If straight, it can be served very cold, but is often served at room temperature. It is also featured in some cocktails. Some mixed drink recipes call for only a few drops of Chartreuse due to the assertive flavour. It is popular in French ski resorts where it is mixed with hot chocolate and called Green Chaud.\n\nAccording to tradition, a marshal of artillery to French king Henry IV, François Hannibal d'Estrées, presented the Carthusian monks at Vauvert, near Paris, with an alchemical manuscript that contained a recipe for an \"elixir of long life\" in 1605. The recipe eventually reached the religious order's headquarters at the Grande Chartreuse monastery, in Voiron, near Grenoble. It has since then been used to produce the \"Elixir Végétal de la Grande Chartreuse\". The formula is said to include 130 herbs, plants and flowers and secret ingredients combined in a wine alcohol base.\n\nThe book \"The Practical Hotel Steward\" (1900) states that green chartreuse contains \"cinnamon, mace, lemon balm, dried hyssop flower tops, peppermint, thyme, costmary, arnica flowers, genepi, and angelica roots\", and that yellow chartreuse is, \"Similar to above, adding cardamom seeds and socctrine aloes.\" However the recipe remains a secret. The monks intended their liqueur to be used as medicine. The recipe was further enhanced in 1737 by Brother Gérome Maubec.\n\nThe beverage soon became popular, and in 1764 the monks adapted the elixir recipe to make what is now called Green Chartreuse.\n\nIn 1793, the monks were expelled from France along with all other Religious Orders and manufacture of the liqueur ceased. A copy of the manuscript was made and kept at the Monastery. The original left with the monks. On the way there, the monk was arrested and sent to prison in Bordeaux. He was not searched and was able to secretly pass the manuscript to one of his friends: Dom Basile Nantas. This friend was convinced that the order would remain in Spain and never come back and that the manufacturing of the liqueur would cease. He sold the manuscript to a pharmacist in Grenoble, Monsieur Liotard. In 1810, Napoleon ordered that all \"secret\" recipes of medicine be sent to the Ministry of Interior for review. The manuscript was sent and returned as \"Refused\" as it was not a secret but well known. At the death of the pharmacist, his heirs returned the manuscript to the monks who had been back at the Monastery since 1816.\n\nIn 1838, they developed Yellow Chartreuse, a sweeter version of the Green Chartreuse, 40% alcohol liqueur (80° proof).\n\nThe monks were again expelled from the monastery following a French law in 1903, and their real property, including the distillery, was confiscated by the government. The monks took their secret recipe to their refuge in Tarragona, Catalonia, and began producing their liqueurs with the same label, but with an additional label which said \"Liqueur fabriquée à Tarragone par les Pères Chartreux\" (\"liquor manufactured in Tarragona by the Carthusian Fathers\"). At the same time, the \"Compagnie Fermière de la Grande Chartreuse\", a corporation in Voiron that obtained the Chartreuse assets, produced a liqueur without benefit of the monks' recipe which they sold as Chartreuse. While the French corporation was acting legally in France, the monks successfully prevented the export of the liqueur to many other countries, since the order retained ownership of its foreign trademark registrations, largely because the recipe had been kept secret. On the night of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, one of the proposed dishes for First class was a Chartreuse based dessert. Sales at the French company were very poor, and by 1929, it faced bankruptcy. A group of local businessmen in Voiron bought all the shares at a low price and sent them as a gift to the monks in Tarragona.\n\nAfter regaining possession of the distillery, the Carthusian brothers returned to the monastery with the tacit approval of the French government and began to produce Chartreuse once again. Despite the eviction law, when a mudslide destroyed the distillery in 1935, the French government assigned Army engineers to relocate and rebuild it at a location near Voiron where the monks had previously set up a distribution point. After World War II, the government lifted the expulsion order, making the Carthusian brothers once again legal French residents.\n\nUntil the 1980s, there was another distillery at Tarragona in Spain.\n\nToday, the liqueurs are produced in Voiron using the herbal mixture prepared by two monks at Grande Chartreuse. They are the only ones to know the secret recipe. The marketing, bottling, packaging, management of the distillery and tours are done by \"Chartreuse Diffusion\", a company created in 1970. Other related alcoholic beverages are manufactured in the same distillery (e.g. Génépi). The exact recipes for all forms of Chartreuse remain trade secrets and are known at any given time only to the two monks who prepare the herbal mixture. Chartreuse is commonly used as an ingredient in cocktails, such as a Cloister.\n\nChartreuse liquors generally have performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. The basic green offering has won silver and double gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It has also earned an above-average score of 93 from the Beverage Testing Institute and has been given scores in the 96-100 interval by Wine Enthusiast. The VEP Green and VEP Yellow have generally earned similarly impressive scores. The basic Yellow Chartreuse has received more modest (though still average or above) ratings.\n\nChartreuse gives its name to the color chartreuse, which was first used as a term of color in 1884.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}
{"id": "320383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320383", "title": "Candlepin bowling", "text": "Candlepin bowling\n\nCandlepin bowling is a variation of bowling that is played primarily in the Canadian Maritime provinces and the New England states of the United States.\n\nCandlepin bowling was developed in 1880 in Worcester, Massachusetts, by Justin White, a local bowling center owner, some years before both the standardization of the tenpin bowling sport in 1895 and the invention of duckpin bowling, said by some sources to have been invented the same year. As in other forms of bowling, the players roll balls down a wooden lane to knock down as many pins as possible. The main differences between candlepin bowling and the predominant tenpin bowling style are that each player uses three balls per frame, rather than two (see below); the balls are much smaller (11.43 cm or 4½ in diameter) with each ball weighing as much as only one candlepin and without finger holes; the pins are thinner (hence the name \"candlepin\"), and thus harder to knock down; and the downed pins (known as \"wood\") are not cleared away between balls during a player's turn. Because of these differences, scoring points is considerably more difficult than in tenpin bowling, and the highest officially sanctioned score ever recorded is 245 out of a possible 300 points. This score was first achieved in 1984 by Ralph Semb, who is the President of the International Candlepin Bowling Association . The record was matched on May 13, 2011 by Chris Sargent of Haverhill, Massachusetts, at the Metro Bowl Lanes candlepin center in Peabody, Massachusetts, and accepted by the ICBA.\n\nA candlepin bowling lane, almost identical to a tenpin bowling lane, has an approach area of for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, a maple surface approximately wide, bounded on either side by a gutter (or \"channel\", or trough.) The lane is separated from the approach by a \"foul line\" common to almost all bowling sports, which must not be crossed by players. At the far end of the lane are the pins, from the foul line to the center of the headpin (or pin #1), placed by a normally \"manually\"-triggered machine called a pinsetter which occupies space both above and behind the pins. Unlike a tenpin lane, which has a level surface all the way from the foul line end of the lane's approach to the back end of the lanebed's \"pin deck\", a candlepin lane has a hard-surfaced \"pin plate\" where the pins are set up, with the pin plate depressed below the lanebed forward of it. The pin plate can be made from hard-surfaced metal, \"phenolic\", \"high density plastic\", or a \"synthetic\" material. Behind the pin plate area of a candlepin lane is a well-depressed \"pit\" area for the felled pins and balls to fall into. A heavy rubber backstop, faced with a black curtain, catches the flying pins and balls so they may drop into the pit. Generally there is seating behind the approach area for teammates, spectators, and score keeping.\n\nThe candlepins themselves are tall, have a cylindrical shape which tapers equally towards each end (and therefore having no distinct \"top\" or \"bottom\" end, unlike a tenpin), giving them an overall appearance somewhat like that of a candle, and have a maximum weight of apiece. Candlepin bowling uses the same numbering system and shape for the formation within the ten candlepins are set, as the tenpin sport does. Also, as in tenpin bowling, due to the spacing of the pins (, center to center), it is impossible for the ball to strike every one. However, while in tenpin a well-placed ball (usually between the head pin and the 2 or 3 pin) may knock down all ten pins (a \"strike\" if on the first ball in a frame) from the chain reaction of pin hitting pin, in candlepins the smaller thickness of the pins makes throwing a strike extremely difficult. In order to count, the pin must be knocked over entirely; in unlucky circumstances, a pin may wobble furiously, or, even more frustratingly, be \"kicked\" to the side by several inches, yet come to rest upright, thus not being scored (and not be reset to its original position for any throws that remain, though it may of course still be knocked over by subsequent balls). It is even possible for a toppled pin to bounce off a side \"kickback\", and return to a standing position on the lane's pin deck in the candlepin sport. However, in the event that a fallen pin returns to a standing position, the pin is still counted as fallen and is played as live wood.\n\nIn addition to the foul line for the bowler themselves, there is a line down the lane from the foul line; this is the lob line, and the ball must first contact the lane at any point on the bowler's side of it, be it on the approach or the first ten feet of the lanebed. Any \"airborne\" ball delivery not making contact with the approach or lanebed short of the \"lob line\" constitutes a violation of this rule, and is termed a lob with any pins knocked down by such a ball not counting — and such pins are not reset if the lobbed ball was not the third and last shot for that player in that box.\n\nAlso, a third line, centered forward of the head pin (number-1 pin) spot is the dead wood line, which defines the maximum forward limit that any toppled pins (\"wood\") can occupy and still be legally playable (\"live wood\"). This lane specification essentially results in the presence of three foul lines, more than in any other bowling sport.\n\nThe ball used in candlepins has a maximum weight of , and has a maximum diameter of , making it the smallest bowling ball of any North American bowling sport. The nearly identical weight of the ball, when compared to that of just one candlepin, tends to cause rapidly delivered balls to sometimes bounce at random when impacting a full rack of pins on the first delivery of a frame, and sometimes when hitting downed \"dead wood\" pins on subsequent deliveries.\n\nA game of candlepin bowling, often called a string in New England, is divided into ten rounds, each of these rounds being most commonly referred to as a box, rather than a \"frame\" as in tenpin bowling. In each normal box, a player is given up to three opportunities to knock down as many pins as possible. In the final box, three balls are rolled regardless of the pincount, meaning three strikes can be scored in the 10th box.\n\nOne unique feature of the candlepin sport is that fallen pins, called wood, are \"not\" removed from the pin deck area between balls, unlike either the tenpin or duckpin bowling sports. The bowler, according to the rules of the sport—before delivering the second or third ball of a box—must also wait until all of the wood on the deck comes to a rest. Depending on where the fallen pins are located on the pindeck and their angle(s) after all movement of them ceases, the wood can be a major help, or obstacle—partly due to the ball having nearly the same weight as one candlepin—in trying to knock down every single standing pin for either a spare or \"ten-box\" score in completing a round.\n\nIn each of the first nine boxes, play proceeds as follows: The first player bowls his first ball at the pins. The pins he knocks down are counted and scored. Then the player rolls a second and a third ball at any remaining targets. If all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (a strike), the player receives ten points plus the count on the next two rolls, the pins are cleared, a new set placed. If all ten pins are knocked down with two balls (a spare), the player receives 10 points plus the count of the next ball, pins are cleared and reset. If all three balls are needed to knock all the pins down, the score for that frame is simply ten, and known in New England as a ten-box. If more than one player is playing on the same lane at the same time, bowlers will typically roll two complete boxes before yielding the lane to the next bowler.\n\nIn the tenth box, play is similar, except that a player scoring a strike is granted two additional balls, scoring a spare earns one additional ball. Three balls are rolled in the tenth box regardless.\n\nIn league play, a bowler may roll two or five boxes at a time, depending on the rules of the league. The five box format is sometimes called a \"speed league,\" and this format is also typical for tournament play. When a bowler is rolling blocks of five boxes, each period is typically called a \"half.\"\n\nA foul (scored by an F on some computer scoring systems) refers to a ball that first rolls into the gutter and then strikes deadwood (felled pins resting in the gutter) or hops out of the gutter and strikes a standing pin, a \"lob\"-bed ball that touches neither the approach, nor lane in the three meters' distance of lanebed before the lob line, or as in tenpins and duckpins, a roll made by a bowler's foot crossing over the foot foul line shared by nearly all bowling sports. Special scoring comes into play.\n\nA foul always scores zero (0) pinfall for that ball's delivery. A player may reset the pins after a foul on the first or second ball provided no pins have legally been felled in that box. Therefore, if on the first ball there is a foul or zero, and on the second ball the bowler fouls and knocks down pins, the pins may be reset, allowing the bowler an opportunity to score a ten box on their third ball. Knocking down all ten pins after resetting immediately following a foul in the first ball results in a spare. Fouling on all three attempts scores a zero box.\n\nIf the first ball knocked down at least one pin, the rack can not be reset because of a subsequent foul. Those pins felled by a foul ball (a ball rolled into the gutter, a lobbed ball, a ball delivered by a bowler over the foot foul line)—whether standing, playable wood, or pins in the gutter—remain down and reduce the maximum number of pins to be counted for the box. Therefore, if there are six pins standing after the first ball, a foul on the next ball that manages to knock down the remaining six pins means that the frame is finished, with a score of 4. However, if the foul ball knocked down only some of the six standing pins, a third ball may still be rolled to attempt to knock down the remaining upright pins. In this example, the raw score might appear to be \"4 4 2 = X\", but after adjusting for the foul second ball, the true score is \"4 F 2 = 6\". Similar logic holds when rolling two good balls and fouling in the third attempt: the frame is over and only the pins felled in the first two attempts are recorded for the score for that box.\n\nWhile some candlepin alleys have automated scoring systems, and thus know when to trigger a candlepin pinsetter to clear and reset pins; other alleys, especially older ones that require a manual method to initiate the pinsetter will have a button, or floor-mounted foot pedal switch, to start the pinsetter's electrically-powered clearing and resetting of pins. Before the era of the Bowl-Mor powered pinsetter units' debut in 1949, as with ten-pin, candlepins were set by workers called \"pinboys\".\n\nOne point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So, in a hypothetical game, if player A felled 3 pins with their first ball, then 5 with their second, and 1 with the third, they would receive a total of 9 points for that box. If player B knocks down 9 pins with their first shot, but misses with their second and third, they would also score 9.\n\nIn the event that all ten pins are felled by any one player in a single box, by no more than two throws (just as in tenpins) bonuses are awarded for a strike or spare. A strike is achieved with just the first delivery downing all ten pins, with a spare needing two throws, again just as in the tenpin sport. If all ten pins are felled by rolling all three balls in a box, the result is a Ten or ten-box, usually marked by an X (as in the Roman numeral for ten) but no additional points are awarded. (In tenpin bowling, a strike is often scored with an X).\n\nThe maximum score in a game is 300. This is scored by bowling 12 strikes: one in each box, and a strike with both bonus balls in the 10th box. In this way, each box will score 30 points (see above: scoring: strike).\n\nThis scoring system, except for the scoring sheet's appearance and the graphic symbols used to record strikes, spares and 10-boxes, is identical to that of duckpins, as it is the other major form of bowling that uses three balls per frame.\n\nThe candlepin scoring sheet is different from either tenpins or duckpins, in that it is usually oriented vertically, with two columns of squares in a two-square-wide, ten-square-tall arrangement to score one string for one player. The left-hand column is used to detail the \"per-box\" score, with the cumulative total being recorded down the sheet as each box is rolled in the right-hand column of squares, in a top-down order from the first box to the tenth.\n\nSpares and strikes are also marked uniquely in candlepins. Spares are recorded in a box by coloring in the left upper corner of the appropriate left-hand square (using a triangular shape to \"fill-in the corner\"). If a strike is recorded, opposing corners of the left-hand square are similarly colored in, while leaving sufficient space between the \"filled-in\" opposing corners, to record the score from the two succeeding balls' \"fill\" total for the strike. A common (albeit unofficial) practice is to mark a strike on a strike's bonus ball (double strike) by shading in the remaining two corners of the first strike.\n\nWhen all 10 pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike), a player is awarded 10 points, plus a bonus of whatever they score with their next 2 balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are scored twice.\n\nA \"spare\" is awarded when all pins are knocked down with a fair ball in or by the second ball roll in the same frame. For example, a player uses the first two balls of a box to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded 10 points, plus a bonus of whatever they score with their next ball (only the first ball is counted).\n\nA player who bowls a spare in the 10th (final) box, is awarded one extra ball so as to allow for their bonus points.\n\nA (known as \"Ten-box\") is when all the pins are knocked down after the third ball of a box. A player achieving a is awarded 10 points, but without any bonus for the following ball.\n\nCorrect calculation of bonus points can be a bit tricky, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive boxes. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems. When a scoring system is \"automated\", the bowler only has to bowl. It keeps score and will reset the pinsetter after three balls are thrown or all 10 pins have been knocked down. If a scoring system is \"semiautomated\", the bowler has to enter the score but the computer will keep track of it. The bowler needs to press a button at the end of the ball return to receive a new \"rack\" of pins.\n\nCandlepin bowling uses its own colorful jargon to refer to the many scenarios that can arise in a game, with most of the terms denoting different combinations of pins left standing after the first ball has been rolled. Examples of these terms include:\n\nFrom 1958 until 1996, a weekly professional bowling match was produced by Boston television station WHDH-TV/WCVB-TV (channel 5), airing every Saturday morning, called \"Candlepin Bowling\". The winner of this match would return the following Saturday to face a new opponent determined by the outcome of qualifying matches, or \"roll-offs\", held during the week. The program was hosted by sports announcers Jim Britt and Don Gillis. Cash prizes were awarded to both the winner and loser of the televised match, with bonuses for rolling three consecutive marks (strikes or spares in any combination, or a larger bonus for three strikes in a row), and for rolling a cumulative score of 400 or higher in the three games, or \"strings\", of which each match consisted. The highest series achieved in the history of the show was a 500-triple by Paul Berger, in 1992. The bowler was given an additional cash prize for reaching 500. For most of the year, this competition was restricted to men only, with a few weeks devoted to matches for women only; other televised matches were also held, involving mixed doubles teams of one male and one female bowler.\n\nThere is also a show that originates from the 1–7–10 Sportscenter in Augusta, Maine. It is on Spectrum channel 9 and is shown every Sunday night at 7 p.m. This show has been on air since 1997.\n\nThe ATV network in Atlantic Canada also aired a weekly, Saturday afternoon candlepin bowling show from September 12, 1986 to September 4, 1993, matching bowlers from New Brunswick against those from Nova Scotia. Its sponsors were the Number 7 (1986–1988), Mark 10 (1988–1990), and Belvedere (1990–1993) cigarette companies.\n\nEach show is listed with its station of origin\n\"Candlepin Bowling\" was the first candlepin bowling show to be broadcast on television. When WHDH lost its broadcast license, the show simply moved to the new channel 5, WCVB. Originally taped at the former Boylston Bowladrome (1260 Boylston Street, Boston), then at Sammy White's Brighton Bowl, the show moved to the Fairway Lanes (demolished in 2011) in Natick (where \"Candlepin Doubles\" was already taping) when Sammy White's closed down in 1986. From 1976 to 1995, there were a total of 20 candlepin championship shows that were broadcast live at the end of every season with the top bowlers with the top scores posted during the regular season of Candlepin Bowling. The first seven pitted the top two bowlers in a three string championship final, and then starting in 1983, the top five bowlers competed to take home $10,000 for first place. The first ten were at Sammy White's from 1976 to 1985, then at Fairway Lanes from 1986 to 1987, and from 1988 to 1995 at Pilgrim Lanes in Haverhill, Massachusetts. \"Candlepin Bowling\" was canceled in 1996 due to WCVB's lessened interest in the broadcasting of local shows. WCVB was also more interested in the broadcasting of Boston College football games. During the 1980s and 1990s, this program was also locally syndicated to WGGB-TV Channel 40 in Springfield, Massachusetts and WPRI-TV Channel 12 in Providence, Rhode Island. In the late 1970s through 1985, the show used Van McCoy's disco dance hit \"The Hustle\" as its theme song.\nA children's version of \"Candlepin Bowling\", showcasing the best bowlers under 16 years of age. Taped at Sammy White's Brighton Bowl.\nA youth bowling show taped on two candlepin lanes in the Channel 7 parking garage in Boston. Each program consisted of two 2-string matches, one boys' and one girls' match, in one of two age groups (junior/senior).\nWSMW-TV (Channel 27) in Worcester first aired in 1970. This was one of WSMW's inaugural shows when the station first went on the air. The format was similar to Channel 5's \"Candlepin Bowling\". This show was notable for its use of the 1972 pop hit \"Roundabout\" by the British band Yes, as well as the 1975–1981 animated opening theme to the tune of The Spinners' \"Rubberband Man\". This show, and all of WSMW's other programming, got cancelled in late 1982 when the station's pay-TV movie block expanded to a 24/7 schedule. Taped at Thunderbird Bowl in Auburn.\n\"Candlepin \" was a mixed doubles show. Premiering soon after WCVB took over the Channel 5 band, the \"\" pitted two teams made up of one male and one female bowler each. Taped at Sammy White's Brighton Bowl.\n\"Candlepins for Cash\", being Boston's regional version of Claster Television's \"Bowling for Dollars\" franchise, devolved from a competitive nature to more of a game show format. Bowlers were introduced one by one to win money and prizes by how well they did on the lanes. Also featured a special \"red pin\" which was worth extra cash if felled on a strike. WNAC taped the show in studio on lanes built specially for the show (there were two lanes in the studio alley). When WNAC chose not to renew the show in April 1980, production moved that fall to WXNE, Channel 25, which taped the show at an actual bowling alley, the Wal-Lex Lanes in Waltham, Massachusetts. Host Bob Gamere stayed on for a while after the station switch, but after he left, WXNE hired former Boston Red Sox star Rico Petrocelli as the new host.\n\"Candlepin Doubles\" was a revamped version of \"Candlepin Superbowl\", focusing primarily on all-male and all-female matches, as compared to Super Bowl's mixed doubles format. Taped at Fairway Lanes in Natick.\nNESN's entry into the televised bowling market was similar in format to Channel 5's \"Candlepin Bowling\", however qualifying requirements were more strict than Channel 5, with intentions to attract the best bowlers in the New England area. Taped at the Londonderry Bowling Center in Londonderry, New Hampshire.\nSimilar in format to the Channel 5 show, except in a stepladder format. Starting during the 1988–89 season, each ladder winner qualified for the Tournament of Champions at the end of the season, which was in the same format as the regular season stepladders. Taped at Park Place Lanes in Windham, New Hampshire from 1984 to 1997, and then at Leda Lanes in Nashua, New Hampshire from 1997 to 2005.\nOriginated in Lewiston, Maine, and aired in the Portland, Maine, television market on Sunday mornings in the 1980s and 1990s. Sponsored by La-Z-Boy furniture, the show was famous for its two hosts being seated in recliner-rockers for the event, including cutaway shots of the hosts.\nSimilar to the singles show, each team pitted two candlepin bowlers with winners qualifying for the Tournament of Champions at the end of the season. Taped at Park Place Lanes during the 1991–92 season, and then at the Londonderry Bowling Center the next two seasons.\nThis format features four bowlers, two champions and two challengers, competing for \"skins\" prize money. The four bowlers bowled two strings, and the bowler with the high score each frame won the amount the box was worth. If two, three, or four bowlers tied each frame, the money got carried over to the next frame. The two bowlers with the highest total pinfall moved on to the next show the next week to challenge two other bowlers. During the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons, the show was taped at the Londonderry Bowling Center and there was a total of $400 in prize money up for grabs. The first three boxes each game were worth $10, the next three $15, the next three $25, and the 10th box was worth $50. During the 1996–97 season, the show was at Pilgrim Lanes in Haverhill, Massachusetts. The prize money increased to $600 per show. The first three boxes were worth $20, the next three $25, the next three $30, and the 10th box every game worth $75. Shows were at 12 noon Saturdays on WNDS, followed by 12 noon Sundays with \"Candlepin Stars and Strikes\".\nSimilar in format to the original Channel 5 show. Taped at the 1–7–10 Sportscenter in Augusta, Maine. Adelphia was sold to Time Warner Cable in 2005, and the program no longer appears on the local TWC-TV channel. It is not currently known when either Adelphia or Time Warner cancelled the show.\n\"Candlepin Challenge\" has three bowlers compete against each other, rather than two. Two bowlers compete for one string in the qualifying round, then the winner of that round plays two strings against a third bowler. The overall winner of the second round is declared that week's champion. At the end of each season, the top three bowlers of the season compete in a similar format but with a higher prize than the regular shows. Taped at the Woburn Bowladrome. For its first five seasons on AT&T Cable, the show was called \"The $30,000 Candlepin Challenge\"; it was renamed prior to its sixth season after Comcast bought AT&T Cable, though until 2008, the now-former station ID of CN8 was part of the name. Due to the closing of CN8 by Comcast, this show moved to Comcast SportsNet New England in January 2009. At the end of that season, production ceased due to lack of money and sponsors.\nFormat has a doubles competition by children in three age groups: 11 and under, 12–14, and 15–18. Taped all over states of MA, NH and ME. Each team who wins at each of the three stops will participate in the \"Tournament of Champions\" to win money and a trophy. Anyone who bowls a double strike, or 3 consecutive marks for the 11 and unders, will be entered in a raffle for new bowling balls. At the beginning of the season they host a Pro/Kids event, which is a doubles knockout of a team including one pro adult and one kid. The final event in the \"International Team Event\", where kids from South Centre Bowlarama in Halifax, Nova Scotia, come down to compete to get on a team of 6.\nDespite the similarity in name, this show was not related to the old \"Candlepins For Cash\" format; instead it was based more on the Stars and Strikes format. After WLVI's sale to Sunbeam Television in December 2006, the show was put on indefinite hiatus. In February 2007, Executive Producer Bart Maderios reclaimed the rights to his show and announced that two \"major networks\" were negotiating to bring the show back into production; however, no further updates had surfaced, and the website has now vanished.\nA web-based candlepin program, recorded at New Palace Lanes in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. \"King of the Palace\" also airs on numerous Massachusetts local access TV stations. The show is a ladder-based tournament with five seeds, starting with the bottom two seeds, with the winner working his way up to challenge the first seed. The defending champion gains automatic entry as the fifth seed, but may bowl his or her way to a higher seed in the roll-off. At the end of the fourth match, the first- and second-place winners have a shot at the \"Spread Eagle Challenge\" for a chance to win an accumulative jackpot. The show alternates between a singles, 80% handicap ladder; a singles, scratch ladder; and a doubles, 80% handicap ladder. There have also been a women's singles, 80% handicap ladder show; and a doubles bracket, which was scratch with 220 average cap.\nA web-based candlepin program, shot at Ficco's Bowladrome in Franklin, Massachusetts through the spring of 2015. Starting in the fall of 2015, it is hosted at Ryan Family Amusements in Millis, Massachusetts following the closing of Ficco's.\nA web-based candlepin program, shot at Riverwalk Lanes in Amesbury, Massachusetts. \"Classic Candlepins\" also airs on local access TV stations. The show is a ladder-based tournament with five seeds. Each round is a scratch, three-string, total pinfall competition, inspired by the format of the original \"Candlepin Bowling\" and \"Candlepin Stars and Strikes\" shows. The first ladder of the new year is a women's ladder, and at the end of the year, all of the ladder champions (including the champion of the women's ladder) are entered into a tournament of champions. The first tournament of champions was won by Mark Ricci.\n\n\n"}

The candy is roughly long and shaped in the form of a bear. The gummy bear is one of many gummies, popular gelatin-based candies sold in a variety of shapes and colors.\n\nThe gummy bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name (gum or gummy bear), or in the endearing form ([little] gum or gummy bear). Gum arabic was the original base ingredient used to produce the gummy bears, hence the name \"gum\" or \"gummy\". Hans Riegel, Sr., a confectioner from Bonn, started the Haribo company in 1920. In 1922, inspired by the trained bears seen at street festivities and markets in Europe through to the 19th century, he invented the Dancing Bear (\"Tanzbär\"), a small, affordable, fruit-flavored gum candy treat for children and adults alike, which was much larger in form than its later successor, the Gold-Bear (\"Goldbär\"). Even during Weimar Germany's hyperinflation period that wreaked havoc on the country, Haribo's fruit-gum Dancing Bear treats remained affordably priced for a mere 1 Pfennig, in pairs, at kiosks. The success of the Dancing Bear's successor would later become Haribo's world-famous Gold-Bears candy product in 1967.\n\nThe success of gummi bears has spawned the production of many other gummy candies that look like animals and other objects: rings, worms, frogs, snakes, hamburgers, cherries, sharks, penguins, hippos, lobsters, octopuses, apples, peaches, oranges, and even \"Ampelmännchen\", Smurfs, and spiders. Manufacturers offer sizes from the standard candy size, and smaller, to bears that weigh several kilograms.\n\nIn the United States, Haribo gummy bears are sold in five flavors: raspberry (red); orange (orange); strawberry (green); pineapple (colorless); and lemon (yellow). Trolli's bears are similarly most often sold in five flavors in the United States, and in the same colors; however, Trolli's red bear is strawberry-flavored, while the green is lime and the colorless is grape. Many companies emulate either Haribo or Trolli flavor-color combinations. Health-oriented brands, which often use all-natural flavors, sometimes opt for more and different flavors. For example, the boxed bulk gummis sold by Sunflower/Newflower Markets include grape, pineapple-coconut, and peach, among others.\n\nThe traditional gummy bear is made from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid, and gelatin. However, recipes vary, such as organic candy, those suitable for vegetarians, or those following religious dietary laws.\n\nProduction uses a specialized machine called a starch mogul. The image of the gummy bear is stamped into a tray filled with powdered starch. The hot, liquid mixture is poured into the indentations in the starch and allowed to cool overnight. Once the mixture has set, the candies can be removed from the mold and packaged. The molds are open on top, so only the bear's front is formed while the back remains flat. The original design for each type of candy is carved into plaster by an artist, then duplicated by a machine and used to create the starch molds for the production line.\n\nGummy bears made with bovine, porcine or piscine gelatin are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Those with porcine gelatin or from animals not slaughtered in either of the two contradictory ritualistic fashions do not conform to kashrut or halal dietary laws. In its factory in Turkey, Haribo produces halal bears and other sweets which are made with bovine gelatin. Also, some gummy bears are made with pectin or starch instead of gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians.\n\nLarge sour gummy bears are larger and flatter than regular ones, have a softer texture, and include fumaric acid or other acid ingredients to produce a sour flavor. Some manufacturers produce sour bears with a different texture, based on starch instead of gelatin. Typically, starch produces a shorter (cleaner bite, less chewy) texture than gelatin.\n\nGummy bears ordinarily contain mostly empty calories, but recently gummy bears containing vitamin C, produced by manufacturers such as Sconza or Bear Essentials, are being marketed to parents of young children. Multivitamins have also been produced in the form of gummi bears to motivate consumption by young, picky eaters.\n\nGummy bears, and other gummi candy, stick to teeth and may cause tooth decay. However, gummi bears containing the cavity-fighting additive xylitol (wood sugar) are now being tested. Trolli has developed a line of gummi candy which is claimed to help the immune system and teeth: the acti-line.\n\nThere has been concern that gelatin in most gummy bears may harbor prions, particularly those that cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and new-variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans. Based on studies, the United States FDA and other national organizations and countries consider the risk of BSE transmission through gelatin to be minuscule as long as precautions are followed during manufacturing.\n\n\n"}

National S'mores Day is celebrated annually on August 10. The Guinness World Record for the number of people making s'mores at one time was 423. It was set on April 21, 2016 in Huntington Beach, California.\n\n\"S'more\" is a contraction of the phrase \"some more\". One early published recipe for a s'more is found in a book of recipes published by the Campfire Marshmallows company in the 1920s. where it was called a \"Graham Cracker Sandwich\". The text indicates that the treat was already popular with both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. In 1927, a recipe for \"Some More\" was published in \"Tramping and Trailing with the Girl Scouts\". \n\nThe contracted term \"s'mores\" appears in conjunction with the recipe in a 1938 publication aimed at summer camps. A 1956 recipe uses the name \"S'Mores\", and lists the ingredients as \"a sandwich of two graham crackers, toasted marshmallow and chocolate bar\". A 1957 Betty Crocker cookbook contains a similar recipe under the name of \"s'mores\". \n\nThe 1958 publication \"Intramural and Recreational Sports for High School and College\" makes reference to \"marshmallow toasts\" and \"s'mores hikes\" as does its related predecessor, the \"Intramural and Recreational Sports for Men and Women\" published in 1949.\n\nS'mores are traditionally cooked using a campfire, though they can also be made at home in an oven, in a microwave or with a s'mores-making kit. A marshmallow, usually held by a metal or wooden skewer, is heated over the fire until it is golden brown. Traditionally, the marshmallow is gooey but not burnt, but, depending on individual preference and cooking time, marshmallows can range from barely warm to charred. The roasted marshmallow is then added on top of half of a graham cracker and a piece of chocolate. The second half of the cracker is then added on top.\n\nVarious confections containing graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow are often sold as some derivative of a s'mores, but they are not necessarily heated or served in the same shape as the traditional s'mores. The Hershey's S'mores bar is one example. Pop-Tarts also feature a s'mores variety. S'mores can be eaten during Passover if made with Kosher for Passover marshmallows, chocolate and matzo.\n\n"}

It was worn by lancers and uhlans, a type of light cavalry which had its origins in the Lipka Tatars who served the kings of Poland, but were widely copied by the armies of many western nations from the start of the 19th century along with their distinctive style of dress.\n\nThe lancer's kurtka developed from a jacket called a \"kontusz\", which during the late 18th century became shortened into the kurtka. \n\nIn addition to the general meaning of \"jacket\", the word \"kurtka\" refers to the garment normally worn by Sambo practitioners, similar to the keikogi in style and function, although it is tighter fitting and has epaulettes and belt loops.

{"id": "324498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324498", "title": "Mortar (masonry)", "text": "Mortar (masonry)\n\nMortar is a workable paste used to bind building blocks such as stones, bricks, and concrete masonry units, fill and seal the irregular gaps between them, and sometimes add decorative colors or patterns in masonry walls. In its broadest sense mortar includes pitch, asphalt, and soft mud or clay, such as used between mud bricks. \"Mortar\" comes from Latin meaning crushed.\n\nCement mortar becomes hard when it cures, resulting in a rigid aggregate structure; however the mortar is intended to be weaker than the building blocks and the sacrificial element in the masonry, because the mortar is easier and less expensive to repair than the building blocks. Mortars are typically made from a mixture of sand, a binder, and water. The most common binder since the early 20th century is Portland cement but the ancient binder lime mortar is still used in some new construction. Lime and gypsum in the form of plaster of Paris are used particularly in the repair and repointing of buildings and structures because it is important the repair materials are similar to the original materials. The type and ratio of the repair mortar is determined by a \"mortar analysis\". There are several types of cement mortars and additives.\n\nThe first mortars were made of mud and clay. Because of a lack of stone and an abundance of clay, Babylonian constructions were of baked brick, using lime or pitch for mortar. According to Roman Ghirshman, the first evidence of humans using a form of mortar was at the Mehrgarh of Baluchistan in Pakistan, built of sun-dried bricks in 6500 BCE. The ancient sites of Harappan civilization of third millennium BCE are built with kiln-fired bricks and a \"gypsum mortar\". Gypsum mortar, also called plaster of Paris, was used in the construction of the Egyptian pyramids and many other ancient structures. It is made from gypsum, which requires a lower firing temperature. It is therefore easier to make than lime mortar and sets up much faster which may be a reason it was used as the typical mortar in ancient, brick arch and vault construction. Gypsum mortar is not as durable as other mortars in damp conditions.\n\nIn early Egyptian pyramids, which were constructed during the Old Kingdom (~2600–2500 BCE), the limestone blocks were bound by mortar of mud and clay, or clay and sand. In later Egyptian pyramids, the mortar was made of either gypsum or lime. Gypsum mortar was essentially a mixture of plaster and sand and was quite soft.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, multiple cement types have been observed in the sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as the Mohenjo-daro city-settlement that dates to earlier than 2600 BCE. Gypsum cement that was \"\"light grey and contained sand, clay, traces of calcium carbonate, and a high percentage of lime\"\" was used in the construction of wells, drains and on the exteriors of \"\"important looking buildings\".\" Bitumen mortar was also used at a lower-frequency, including in the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro.\n\nHistorically, building with concrete and mortar next appeared in Greece. The excavation of the underground aqueduct of Megara revealed that a reservoir was coated with a pozzolanic mortar 12 mm thick. This aqueduct dates back to c. 500 BCE. Pozzolanic mortar is a lime based mortar, but is made with an additive of volcanic ash that allows it to be hardened underwater; thus it is known as hydraulic cement. The Greeks obtained the volcanic ash from the Greek islands Thira and Nisiros, or from the then Greek colony of Dicaearchia (Pozzuoli) near Naples, Italy. The Romans later improved the use and methods of making what became known as pozzolanic mortar and cement. Even later, the Romans used a mortar without pozzolana using crushed terra cotta, introducing aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide into the mix. This mortar was not as strong as pozzolanic mortar, but, because it was denser, it better resisted penetration by water.\n\nHydraulic mortar was not available in ancient China, possibly due to a lack of volcanic ash. Around 500 CE, sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to make an inorganic−organic composite sticky rice mortar that had more strength and water resistance than lime mortar.\n\nIt is not understood how the art of making hydraulic mortar and cement, which was perfected and in such widespread use by both the Greeks and Romans, was then lost for almost two millennia. During the Middle Ages when the Gothic cathedrals were being built, the only active ingredient in the mortar was lime. Since cured lime mortar can be degraded by contact with water, many structures suffered from wind blown rain over the centuries.\n\nOrdinary Portland cement mortar, commonly known as OPC mortar or just cement mortar, is created by mixing powdered Ordinary Portland Cement, fine aggregate and water.\n\nIt was invented in 1794 by Joseph Aspdin and patented on 18 December 1824, largely as a result of efforts to develop stronger mortars. It was made popular during the late nineteenth century, and had by 1930 became more popular than lime mortar as construction material. The advantages of Portland cement is that it sets hard and quickly, allowing a faster pace of construction. Furthermore, fewer skilled workers are required in building a structure with Portland cement.\n\nAs a general rule, however, Portland cement should not be used for the repair or repointing of older buildings built in lime mortar, which require the flexibility, softness and breathability of lime if they are to function correctly.\nIn the United States and other countries, five standard types of mortar (available as dry pre-mixed products) are generally used for both new construction and repair. Strengths of mortar change based on the ratio of cement, lime, and sand used in mortar. The ingredients and the mix ratio for each type of mortars are specified under the ASTM standards. These premixed mortar products are designated by one of the five letters, M, S, N, O, and K. Type M mortar is the strongest, and Type K the weakest. These type letters are apparently taken from the alternate letters of the words \"MaSoN wOrK\".\n\nPolymer cement mortars (PCM) are the materials which are made by partially replacing the cement hydrate binders of conventional cement mortar with polymers. The polymeric admixtures include latexes or emulsions, redispersible polymer powders, water-soluble polymers, liquid thermoset resins and monomers. It has low permeability, and it reduces the incidence of drying shrinkage cracking, mainly designed for repairing concrete structures. One brand of PCM is MagneLine.\n\nThe setting speed can be increased by using impure limestone in the kiln, to form a hydraulic lime that will set on contact with water. Such a lime must be stored as a dry powder. Alternatively, a pozzolanic material such as calcined clay or brick dust may be added to the mortar mix. Addition of a pozzolanic material will make the mortar set reasonably quickly by reaction with the water.\n\nIt would be problematic to use Portland cement mortars to repair older buildings originally constructed using lime mortar. Lime mortar is softer than cement mortar, allowing brickwork a certain degree of flexibility to adapt to shifting ground or other changing conditions. Cement mortar is harder and allows little flexibility. The contrast can cause brickwork to crack where the two mortars are present in a single wall.\n\nLime mortar is considered breathable in that it will allow moisture to freely move through and evaporate from the surface. In old buildings with walls that shift over time, cracks can be found which allow rain water into the structure. The lime mortar allows this moisture to escape through evaporation and keeps the wall dry. Re−pointing or rendering an old wall with cement mortar stops the evaporation and can cause problems associated with moisture behind the cement.\n\nPozzolana is a fine, sandy volcanic ash. It was originally discovered and dug at Pozzuoli, nearby Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and was subsequently mined at other sites, too. The Romans learned that pozzolana added to lime mortar allowed the lime to set relatively quickly and even under water. Vitruvius, the Roman architect, spoke of four types of pozzolana. It is found in all the volcanic areas of Italy in various colours: black, white, grey and red. Pozzolana has since become a generic term for any siliceous and/or aluminous additive to slaked lime to create hydraulic cement.\n\nFinely ground and mixed with lime it is a hydraulic cement, like Portland cement, and makes a strong mortar that will also set under water.\n\nFirestop mortars are mortars most typically used to firestop large openings in walls and floors required to have a fire-resistance rating. They are passive fire protection items. Firestop mortars differ in formula and properties from most other cementitious substances and cannot be substituted with generic mortars without violating the listing and approval use and compliance.\n\nFirestop mortar is usually a combination of powder mixed with water, forming a cementatious stone which dries hard. It is sometimes mixed with lightweight aggregates, such as perlite or vermiculite. It is sometimes pigmented to distinguish it from generic materials in an effort to prevent unlawful substitution and to enable verification of the certification listing.\n\nAs the mortar hardens, the current atmosphere is encased in the mortar and thus provides a sample for analysis. Various factors affect the sample and raise the margin of error for the analysis.\nThe possibility to use radiocarbon dating as a tool for mortar dating was introduced as early as the 1960s, soon after the method was established (Delibrias and Labeyrie 1964; Stuiver and Smith 1965; Folk and Valastro 1976). The very first data were provided by van Strydonck et al. (1983), Heinemeier et al.(1997) and Ringbom and Remmer (1995). Than the methodological aspect were developed by different groups (an international team headed by Åbo Akademi University, and teams from CIRCE, CIRCe, ETHZ, Poznań, RICH and Milano-Bicocca laboratory. \nTo evaluate the different anthropogenic carbon extraction methods for radiocarbon dating as well as to compare the different dating methods, i.e. radiocarbon and OSL, the first intercomparison study (MODIS) was set up and published in 2017.\n\n\n"}

It was brought to Louisiana by the French immigrants that would merge to create much of Creole culture.\n\nIn the US the sausage is most often associated with Louisiana Creole cuisine, where it is a coarse-grained smoked sausage made using pork, garlic, pepper, onions, wine, and seasonings. The pork used is mostly from a smoked Boston shoulder roast. Once the casing is stuffed, the sausage is smoked again (double smoked).\nNicknamed \"The Andouille Capital of the World,\" the town of LaPlace, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River, is especially noted for its Creole andouille.\n\nThe country Cajuns west of Lafayette, Louisiana made andouille similar to the French. They seasoned the pig intestines with salt and cayenne pepper, soaked them in a water and vinegar bath overnight, and then rinsed them well before stuffing them one into another lengthwise. They cut and tied them into long links with string and hung them with the sausage in the smoke house. They were not twisted into links because they were too dense. When a link is cut, you can see the concentric rings of the intestines. They never called it \"andouille sausage\", just \"andouille\"; i.e. sausage and andouille are two different things to these Cajuns.\n\nThough somewhat similar, andouille is not to be confused with \"hot links\" or similar finely ground, high-fat, heavily peppered sausages.\n\nIn France, particularly Brittany, the traditional ingredients of andouille are primarily pig chitterlings, tripe, onions, wine, and seasoning. It is generally grey in color and has a distinctive odor. Also, a similar sausage is available called andouillette, literally \"little andouille\".

Over the years, the martini has become one of the best-known mixed alcoholic beverages. \n\nH. L. Mencken called the martini \"the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet\" and E. B. White called it \"the elixir of quietude\".\n\nBy 1922 the martini reached its most recognizable form in which London dry gin and dry vermouth are combined at a ratio of 2:1, stirred in a mixing glass with ice cubes, with the optional addition of orange or aromatic bitters, then strained into a chilled cocktail glass. Over time the generally expected garnish became the drinker's choice of a green olive or a twist of lemon peel.\n\nA dry martini is made with dry, white vermouth. By the Roaring Twenties, it became common to ask for them. Over the course of the century, the amount of vermouth steadily dropped. During the 1930s the ratio was 3:1 (gin to vermouth), and during the 1940s the ratio was 4:1. During the latter part of the 20th century, 6:1, 8:1, 12:1, 15:1 (the \"Montgomery\", after British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's supposed penchant for attacking only when in possession of great numerical superiority), or even 50:1 or 100:1 Martinis became considered the norm.\n\nA dirty martini contains a splash of olive brine or olive juice and is typically garnished with an olive.\n\nA perfect martini uses equal amounts of sweet and dry vermouth.\n\nSome martinis were prepared by filling a cocktail glass with gin, then rubbing a finger of vermouth along the rim. There are those who advocated the elimination of vermouth altogether. According to Noël Coward, \"A perfect martini should be made by filling a glass with gin, then waving it in the general direction of Italy\", Italy being a major producer of vermouth. Luis Buñuel used the dry martini as part of his creative process, regularly using it to sustain \"a reverie in a bar\". He offers his own recipe, involving Angostura bitters, in his memoir.\n\nIn 1966, the American Standards Association (ASA) released K100.1-1966, \"Safety Code and Requirements for Dry Martinis\", a tongue-in-cheek account of how to make a \"standard\" dry martini. The latest revision of this document, K100.1-1974, was published by American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the successor to ASA, though it is no longer an active standard.\n\nThe traditional martini comes in a number of variations. The fictional spy James Bond sometimes asked for his vodka martinis to be \"shaken, not stirred\", following Harry Craddock's \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930), which prescribes shaking for all its martini recipes. The proper name for a shaken martini is a Bradford; however, Somerset Maugham is often quoted as saying that \"a martini should always be stirred, not shaken, so that the molecules lie sensuously on top of one another.\" A martini may also be served on the rocks; that is, with the ingredients poured over ice cubes and served in an Old-Fashioned glass.\n\nThe exact origin of the martini is unclear. In 1863, an Italian vermouth maker started marketing their product under the brand name of Martini, after its director Alessandro Martini, and the brand name may be the source of the cocktail's name.\n\nAnother popular theory suggests it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez served sometime in the early 1860s at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, which people frequented before taking an evening ferry to the nearby town of Martinez, California. Alternatively, the people of Martinez say a bartender in their town created the drink, or maybe the drink was named after the town. Indeed, a \"Martinez Cocktail\" was first described in Jerry Thomas' 1887 edition of his \"Bartender's Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks\":\n\nOther bartending guides of the late 19th century contained recipes for numerous cocktails similar to the modern-day martini. For example, Harry Johnson's \"Bartenders' Manual\" (1888) listed a recipe for a drink that consisted in part of half a wine glass of Old Tom gin and a half a wine glass of vermouth.\n\nThe first dry martini is sometimes linked to the name of a bartender who concocted the drink at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912. The \"Marguerite Cocktail\", first described in 1904, could be considered an early form of the dry martini, because it was a 2:1 mix of Plymouth dry gin and dry vermouth, with a dash of orange bitters.\n\nDuring Prohibition in the United States, during the mid-20th century, the relative ease of illegal gin manufacture led to the martini's rise as the locally predominant cocktail. With the repeal of Prohibition, and the ready availability of quality gin, the drink became progressively drier. In the 1970s and '80s, the martini came to be seen as old-fashioned and was replaced by more intricate cocktails and wine spritzers, but the mid-1990s saw a resurgence in the drink and numerous new versions.\n\nSome newer drinks include the word \"martini\" or the suffix \"-tini\" in the name (e.g., appletini, peach martini, chocolate martini, espresso martini). These are so named because they are served in a martini cocktail glass. Generally containing vodka, they share little in common with the martini.\n\n"}
{"id": "329180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329180", "title": "Girl Scout Cookies", "text": "Girl Scout Cookies\n\nGirl Scout Cookies are cookies sold by Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA) as one of its major fundraisers for local Scout units. According to GSUSA, the Girls Scout Cookie Program is the largest girl-run and girl-led financial literacy program in the world, and the largest annual fundraiser in the world dedicated to girls. The program is designed to be led and conducted by girls and not led by adult troop leaders, volunteers or parents. The girls get to decide how to spend the money they make, as 10 to 15 percent of net revenue from cookie sales goes toward local community projects or is donated to worthy causes decided by each troop.\n\nDuring each cookie season (running from January through April) the all-girl-led entrepreneurial educational program sells approximately 200 million packages of cookies, worth nearly $800 million. Members of the GSUSA have been selling cookies since 1917 to raise funds. Girls who participate can earn prizes for their efforts. There are also troop incentives if the troop as a whole does well.\n\nThe first known cookie sales by an individual Girl Scout unit were by the Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in December 1917 at their local high school. In 1922, the Girl Scout magazine \"The American Girl\" suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser and provided a simple sugar cookie recipe from a regional director for the Girl Scouts of Chicago. In 1933, Girl Scouts in Philadelphia organized the first commercial sale, selling homemade cookies at the windows of the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (PGE). From 1933 to 1935, organized cookie sales rose, with troops in Philadelphia and New York City using the cookie-selling model to develop the marketing and sales skills of their local troops. In 1936, Girl Scouts of the USA began licensing commercial bakers to produce cookies, in order to increase availability and reduce lead time, starting with Keebler-Weyl Bakery. Southern Biscuit Company and Burry Biscuit, both later acquired by the Interbake Foods division of George Weston Limited, were added in 1937. One hundred twenty five troops launched cookie sales that first year.\n\nDuring World War II the Girl Scouts sold calendars in addition to cookies, because of shortages of flour, sugar, and butter. In 1943 there were 48 cookies per box. By 1943 Girl Scouts also collected fat in cans to aid the war effort and sold war bonds at no profit. In the 1950s, three more cookie recipes were added: \"Shortbreads\"/\"Scot-Teas\", \"Savannahs\" (today called \"Peanut Butter Sandwich\"), and \"Thin Mints\". Six types of cookies were being sold nationwide by 1956. Greater cookie sales occurred due to the Baby Boomer generation entering Girl Scouts in the 1960s. \"Samoas\" were added in the 1970s. In 1978, the National Council reduced the number of bakeries providing cookies to four and standardized the packaging and pricing of the cookies.\n\nIn the 1990s, the National Council limited the bakeries providing cookies to just ABC Bakers (a division of Interbake Foods) and Little Brownie Bakers (a division of the Keebler Company). In 1998, cookie sale awards were instituted. The Girl Scouts moved to eliminate trans fat from its cookies in 2005, and started providing nutritional information on the cookie box. In 2009 the number of Thin Mints, Do-si-dos, and Tagalongs in each box was reduced and Lemon Chalet Cremes became smaller because of the increasing costs of ingredients and transportation. In January 2015, Girl Scouts began to offer customers the ability to purchase cookies using an online portal though a mobile app called \"Digital Cookie\". The app can only be used by Girl Scouts themselves with parent supervision, and Girl Scouts are able to share an individual link to their online cookie business to friends and family only. \n\nEach Girl Scout regional council decides which licensed baking company to use for cookie sales in that council, thus determining which varieties are available in the area covered by the council.\n\nGirl Scouts sell cookies to relatives, friends, neighbors, and others in their town or city. In recent years, because of safety concerns, an increased emphasis has been placed on cookie booths, where girls sell from tables in public areas under the supervision of adult troop leaders, rather than door-to-door. Many councils offer the option for customers to sponsor boxes of cookies to be sent to U.S. servicemen and women. Cookies are also available online.\n\nAs an incentive to sell, Girl Scouts are offered recognitions and rewards, such as stuffed animals, trinkets, coupons, or credits toward Girl Scout camp, activities, or uniforms. These recognitions and rewards vary from Girl Scout council to council. The rewards are usually cumulative, so that a girl who earns the reward for selling 50 boxes of cookies will also get the 25- and 20-box items. In some councils, girls may choose to earn more money for their troop instead of recognitions if they are working toward a troop goal such as a trip or other expensive activity. This type of fundraising is intended to teach Girl Scouts valuable entrepreneurial skills such as planning, teamwork, financial literacy, organization, communication, and goal setting.\n\nAlso, award badges exist for sales: Cookie Count, Smart Cookie, The Cookie Connection, Cookie Biz, and Cookies & Dough.\n\nTraditionally each regional Girl Scout council set the prices for cookies sold in that council. A 2006 article in \"The Boston Globe\" noted that price \"is hardly ever a factor, until buyers find out that the same box of cookies is selling for less in the next town over.\" The \"Globe\" found that a box of Thin Mints sold for $3.50 in Rockland, Massachusetts and $4.00 in neighboring Norwell.\n\nElizabeth Brinton, also known as the \"Cookie Queen\", sold a record 18,000 boxes of cookies in a single sales season, and more than 100,000 boxes in her time as a girl scout. She is known for selling cookies to sitting president Ronald Reagan. Her record held for more than twenty-nine years, until Katie Francis, 12, sold 18,107 boxes in 2014. In 2017, Charlotte McCourt, a girl scout from New Jersey, sold over 25,000 boxes of cookies, breaking the record.\n\nEach Girl Scout council operates its own cookie sale. Approximately 70% of the proceeds stay in the local Girl Scout council to support Girl Scouting in that area, including a portion, approximately 15%, that goes directly to the group selling the cookies. The profits are divided by a formula, with local troops receiving about 10-15% of the retail price, the council more than 50%, and the manufacturer the remainder. In 1992 Girl Scouts sold 175 million boxes of cookies nationwide.\n\nRevenues at all levels are used to pay for events and activities for the Girl Scouts, maintenance of the councils' Girl Scout camps and other properties, cookie sale incentives, and Council administrative costs.\n\nGirl Scout cookies are made by large national commercial bakeries under license from Girl Scouts of the USA. The bakers licensed by the organization may change from year to year, though this is not common. In 2008 the licensed companies were Little Brownie Bakers (LBB), a subsidiary of Keebler, which is owned by Kellogg's; and ABC Bakers, a subsidiary of Interbake Foods, which is owned by George Weston Limited.\n\nUp to 28 varieties of Girl Scout cookies are offered. The same cookies may be sold under different names by different bakeries, with the choice of bakery determining the name. There has been no move to standardize names. The merger of many councils (from 312 to 109) following the August 2006 reorganization resulted in many councils changing bakeries, thus causing some confusion at that time.\n\nThin Mints are the most popular Girl Scout Cookies, with Samoas/Caramel deLites the second most popular. About 50 million boxes of Thin Mints were sold in 2013 compared with 38 million boxes of Samoas. Thin Mints averages about 38 cookies per box and Samoas 15 cookies per box.\n\nGirl Scout cookie varieties include:\n\nOperation Thin Mint is a program by the Girl Scouts of the USA, led by Girls Scouts from the San Diego-Imperial Council, to provide military members with donated cookies. The operation sends over 200,000 boxes of cookies annually to servicemembers stationed in the Middle East. Since the program began in 2002, the Girl Scouts have shipped over 3 million boxes of cookies.\n\nKeebler manufactures a similar cookie known as a Grasshopper, which is produced in the same factory as Little Brownie Bakers's Thin Mints.\n\n\n\nFederal guidelines issued in early 2005 called for people to minimize their consumption of trans fat. Concerned parents urged the Girl Scouts to address this and other health concerns about the cookies, suggesting that the cookie program was at odds with the Girl Scouts' healthy living initiative. The Girl Scout organization replied that the cookies were a treat which \"shouldn't be a big part of somebody's diet\", and said that they are \"encouraging\" the companies that bake the cookies to find alternative oils.\n\nIn 2007, following reformulation of the recipes for a number of varieties, Girl Scouts of the USA announced that all their cookies had less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, allowing them to meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for \"zero trans fat\" labeling.\n\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is used in some cookies. The bakers claim that it is a necessary ingredient in ensuring the quality of the cookie.\n\nIn September 2011, GSUSA released a new policy on palm oil in Girl Scout cookies to take effect from the 2012-13 cookie season. Amongst the pledges made, the GSUSA announced it will purchase GreenPalm certificates to support the sustainable production of palm oil. The certificates offer a premium price to palm oil producers who are operating within the guidelines for social and environmental responsibility set by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.\n\nThe 2011 policy was formed in response to a prolonged campaign by two Girl Scouts, Madison Vorva and Rhiannon Tomtishen. In 2007, as 11-year-olds, Vorva and Tomtishen earned their Girl Scout Bronze Award by raising awareness about the endangered orangutan and their rapid diminishing rainforest habitat in Indonesia and Malaysia. When they discovered that the Girl Scout Cookies contained palm oil, an ingredient that results in rainforest destruction and human rights abuses, the two girls launched a variety of campaigns in order to convince the GSUSA to remove this ingredient from their cookies. Vorva and Tomtishen were awarded the UN Forest Heroes Award in 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "330462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330462", "title": "Moon pie", "text": "Moon pie\n\nA moon pie or stylized as MoonPie is an American confection, popular across much of the United States, which consists of two round graham cracker cookies, with marshmallow filling in the center, dipped in a flavored coating. The snack is often associated with the cuisine of the American South where they are traditionally accompanied by an RC Cola. Today, Moon pies are made by Chattanooga Bakery, Inc. in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nThe traditional pie is approximately in diameter. A smaller version exists (mini Moon pie) that is approximately half the size, and a Double-Decker Moon pie of the traditional diameter features a third cookie and attendant layer of marshmallow. The five main flavors are chocolate, vanilla, banana, strawberry, and salted caramel. Orange and coconut make seasonal appearances during the Mardi Gras parading season.\n\nMoon pies have been made daily at the Chattanooga Bakery since the brand's inception on April 29, 1917. Earl Mitchell Junior said his father came up with the idea for Moon pies when he asked a Kentucky coal miner what kind of snack he would like to eat, and the miner requested something with graham cracker and marshmallow. Popular folklore, repeated and encouraged by Chattanooga Bakery itself, states the miner then asked the snack be \"as big as the moon\", which inspired the name \"moon pie\".\n\nThere is a custom for eating Moon pies with RC Cola, although the origin of this is unknown. It is likely that their inexpensive prices, combined with their larger serving sizes, contributed to establishing this combination as the \"working man's lunch\". The popularity of this combination was celebrated in a popular song of the 1950s, by Big Bill Lister, \"Gimmee an RC Cola and a Moon Pie\". In 1973, NRBQ had a minor hit with the song, \"An RC Cola and a Moon Pie\".\n\nSince New Year's Eve 2008, the city of Mobile, Alabama has been lowering a lighted mechanical moon pie to celebrate the coming of the new year. The giant Moon pie descends the 34 story RSA BankTrust building at the strike of midnight. Every NYE, the world's largest Moon pie is cut and served to the public as part of the festivities. It weighs and contains .\n\nAn annual RC Cola and Moon pie festival is celebrated in Bell Buckle, Tennessee, and a Moon pie eating contest is held in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nOn October 14, 2017, Matt Stonie, a competitive eater famous in national eating contests, ate 73 Single-Decker Moon pies in eight minutes at the Bass Pro Shops store in Memphis, TN.\n\nNewport, Tennessee held its first annual Moon pie Festival in May 2012.\n\nThe company is celebrating its centennial anniversary with a \"My Favorite MoonPie Memory\" contest. The grand prize winner gets a 100-year supply of Moon pies. It's also taking a wrapped Winnebago across the country in the Fall, thanking its top customers and attending various sporting events and festivals.\n\nIn September 2017, as part of its Centennial, Moon pie returned to the original recipe, replacing HFCS with real sugar and removing preservatives and artificial colors and flavors.\n\nThe Moon pie became a traditional \"throw\" (an item thrown from a parade float into the crowd) of Mardi Gras \"krewes\" (parade participants) in Mobile, Alabama during 1956, followed by other communities along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The westernmost outpost of the MoonPie as an important Carnival throw is Slidell, Louisiana, which has a parade by \"The Krewe of Mona Lisa and MoonPie\". Also, in the town of Oneonta, Alabama, there is a MoonPie eating contest started by Wal-Mart employee John Love when he inadvertently ordered too many. This anecdote was featured in Sam Walton's autobiography, \"Made in America\".\n\nThe Moon pie is a traditional celebratory food for remembering the Apollo 11 moon walk that took place on July 20, 1969. Moon pies are used in the commemorative celebration by aerospace workers and enthusiasts across the globe. \n\nA Moon pie is made with marshmallow, which is a low-fat but high-sugar food. The ingredients are as follows: enriched wheat flour (niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), corn syrup, sugar, vegetable shortening (contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and/or cottonseed oil and/or coconut oil and/or palm kernel oil and/or palm oil), soy flour, dutched cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, kosher gelatin, baking soda, lecithin, salt, artificial flavoring, sodium sulfite.\n\nOther flavors (such as banana, vanilla, strawberry, or orange) might have different nutritional content.\n\nSingle-decker\nDouble-decker\nMinis\nMoon Pie Crunch\n\nIn the northern areas of the U.S., a similar product is called a \"Scooter Pie\" and there is also a single-cracker marshmallow cookie called \"Mallomars\". Little Debbie also makes what they call \"Marshmallow Pies\" which are nearly identical to the Moon pies. In the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada a similar product is called \"Wagon Wheels\". In South Korea, the very similar \"Choco Pie\" is produced by several companies. In Japan, there is the smaller-sized \"Angel Pies\" by Morinaga as well as a brand of \"Choco Pie\".\n\n\"Choco pies\" produced by Lotte Confectionery in South Korea are similar, as are \"Mamut\" (Spanish for \"Mammoth\", sold by Gamesa), and \"Rocko\" (marketed by Marinela) in Mexico, and there are there are several other minor brands as well. The \"Halley\" and \"Bimbo\" pies sold in Turkey and Egypt respectively are also similar. In Argentina a similar treat is \"Alfajor\", and more than 20 brands marketed as \"alfajores\" are very popular.\n\nABC-TV's \"Good Morning America\" featured \"The Moon Pie Song\" by Charles Ghigna (Father Goose) during its tour of the Chattanooga Bakery Company in 1991.\n\nIn \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" Season 2 Episode 15 \"Phases\", Xander states that although the full moon can bring out the worst qualities of mankind it \"ironically also led to the invention of the Moon Pie\".

{"id": "330827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330827", "title": "Brioche", "text": "Brioche\n\nBrioche (; ) is a bread of French origin that is similar to a highly enriched pastry, and whose high egg and butter content (400 grams for each kilogram of flour) give it a rich and tender crumb. Chef Joël Robuchon describes it as \"light and slightly puffy, more or less fine, according to the proportion of butter and eggs.\" It has a dark, golden, and flaky crust, frequently accentuated by an egg wash applied after proofing.\n\nBrioche is considered a \"Viennoiserie\", in that it is made in the same basic way as bread, but has the richer aspect of a pastry because of the extra addition of eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and, sometimes, brandy) and occasionally a bit of sugar. Brioche, along with \"pain au lait\" and \"pain aux raisins\"—which are commonly eaten at breakfast or as a snack—form a leavened subgroup of \"Viennoiserie\". Brioche is often cooked with fruit or chocolate chips and served on its own, or as the basis of a dessert with many local variations in added ingredients, fillings or toppings.\n\nBrioche has numerous uses in cuisine and can take on various forms, served plain, or as containers for coulibiac, fillet of beef en croute, foie gras, sausage, cervelat lyonnais, and other appetizers or intermediate courses. \"Brioche à tête\" or \"parisienne\" is perhaps the most classically recognized form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (\"tête\"). \"Brioche Nanterre\" is a loaf of brioche made in a standard loaf pan. Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces of dough are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces together. During the baking process the balls of dough rise further and form an attractive pattern.\n\nBrioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.\n\nBrioche dough contains flour, eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), leavening (yeast or sourdough), salt, and sometimes sugar. Common recipes have a flour to butter ratio of about 2:1.\n\nThe normal method is to make the dough, let it rise to double its volume at room temperature and then punch it down and let it rise again in the refrigerator for varying periods (according to the recipe), retarding the dough to develop the flavor. Refrigeration also stiffens the dough, which still rises, albeit slowly, making it easier to form. The dough is then shaped, placed in containers for the final proofing, and generally brushed on top with an egg wash before being baked at until the crust browns and the interior reaches at least . The first rise time for small rolls is 1 to 1½ hours, for larger brioche the time is lengthened until the loaves double.\n\nThe first recorded use of the word in French dates from 1404. It is attested in 1611 in Cotgrave's \"A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues\", where it is described as \"a rowle, or bunne, of spiced bread\" and its origin given as Norman. A similar type of bread, called tsoureki (τσουρέκι), is also traditionally baked in Greece for the Easter weekend.\n\nIn France it developed as \"a sort of bread improved since antiquity by generations of bakers, then of pastry-makers ... with some butter, some eggs, sugar coming later ... it developed from the blessed bread [pain bénit] of the church which gradually became of better quality, more and more costly, less and less bread; until becoming savoury brioche\". In the 17th century \"pâté à tarte briochée\", \"a pain à brioche pauvre [poor] ... [using only] 3 eggs and 250 grams of butter for 1 kilogram of flour\" was introduced. The terms \"pain bénit\" and \"brioche\" were sometimes used together or virtually interchangeably; so, for example, in another 17th-century recipe entitled: \"CHAPITRE II. Pain bénit, & brioches.\" It begins with a lighter, cheaper version of blessed bread, calling for \"a pound of fresh butter and a soft cheese [but no eggs!] for a pail of flour\"; and goes on to describe \"the more delicate that we call Cousin\", which uses 3 pounds of butter, 2 cheeses, and a royal pint of eggs for the same amount of flour, as well as \"some good milk\" if \"the dough is too firm\". However, sourdough and brewer's yeast preparations would both remain common well into the next century, with \"blessed bread ... more and more often replaced by brioche\" in the 18th century, where \"Those from Gisors and Gournay, great butter markets, were the most highly regarded.\"\n\nFor the wealthy \"from the time of Louis XIV onwards ... Butter, in widespread use at least in the northern half of France, was the secret of making \"brioches\"\". \"In Gisors, on market days, they produce up to 250 or 300 kg of brioches. The dough is made the evening before (1 kg of farine, a quarter of which for the starter, 10 g of yeast, 7 or 8 eggs; one mixes this together with the starter and 800 g of butter, breaking up the dough, which 'uses up the butter'). The dough is kept in a terrine, and one puts it in a mold just at the moment of baking. Thus prepared, the brioche remains light, keeps well, maintains the flavour of butter, without the stench of the starter.\" Brioche of varying degrees of richness from the rich man's with a flour to butter ratio of 3:2 to the cheaper pain brioché with a ratio of 4:1 existed at the same time.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, in his autobiography \"Confessions\" (published posthumously in 1782, but completed in 1769), relates that \"a great princess\" is said to have advised, with regard to peasants who had no bread, \"Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\", commonly translated inaccurately as \"Let them eat cake\". This saying is commonly mis-attributed to Queen Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI. In the contemporaneous \"Encyclopédie\" it says: \"the taste for luxury and onerous magnificence of much of the world, having slipped into religious practice, the usage was introduced in large cities of giving in place of bread, some more or less delicate cake ... one would not believe what it costs the nation every year for this article alone. We know that there are more than 40,000 parishes in the kingdom where they distribute blessed bread.\"\n\nAlthough there has been much debate about the etymology of the word and, thus, the recipe's origins, it is now widely accepted that it is derived from the Old French verb \"brier\", \"a Norman dialectical form of \"broyer\", to work the dough with a \"broye\" or \"brie\" (a sort of wooden roller for kneading); the suffix \"-oche\" is a generic deverbal suffix. \"Pain brié\" is a Norman bread whose dense dough was formerly worked with this instrument.\" The root—bhreg—is of Germanic origin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "331200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331200", "title": "Cassock", "text": "Cassock\n\nThe cassock or soutane is an item of Christian clerical clothing used by the clergy of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and Reformed churches, among others. \"Ankle-length garment\" is the literal meaning of the corresponding Latin term, \"vestis talaris\". It is related to the habit, which is traditionally worn by nuns, monks, and friars.\n\nThe cassock derives historically from the tunic that in ancient Rome was worn underneath the toga and the chiton that was worn beneath the himation in ancient Greece. In religious services, it has traditionally been worn underneath vestments, such as the alb.\n\nIn the West, the cassock is little used today except for religious services, save for clergy in traditionalist Catholic orders such as the Society of Saint Pius X, the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius, and the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen who continue to wear the cassock as their standard clerical attire. However, in many countries it was the normal everyday wear of the clergy until the second half of the 20th century, when it was replaced even in those countries by a conventional suit, distinguished from lay dress by being generally black and by incorporating a clerical collar.\n\nThe word \"cassock\" comes from Middle French , meaning a long coat. In turn, the Old French word may come ultimately from Turkish (nomad, adventurer – the source of the word \"Cossack\"), an allusion to their typical riding coat, or from Persian (padded garment) – (raw silk) + (stuffed). The name was originally specially applied to the dress worn by soldiers and horsemen, and later to the long garment worn in civil life by both men and women. As an ecclesiastical term the word \"cassock\" came into use somewhat late (as a translation of the old names of subtanea, vestis talaris, toga talaris, or tunica talaris), being mentioned in canon 74 of 1604; and it is in this sense alone that it now survives.\n\nThe word \"soutane\" is a French-derived word, coming from Italian , derived in turn from Latin , the adjectival form of (beneath).\n\nThe cassock (or soutane) comes in a number of styles or cuts, though no particular symbolism attaches to these. A Roman cassock often has a series of buttons down the front. In some English-speaking countries these buttons may be merely ornamental, with a concealed fly-front buttoning, known as a Chesterfield front, used to fasten the garment. A French cassock also has buttons sewn to the sleeves after the manner of a suit, and a slightly broader skirt. An Ambrosian cassock has a series of only five buttons under the neck, with a sash on the waist. A Jesuit cassock, in lieu of buttons, has a fly fastened with hooks at the collar and is bound at the waist with a cincture knotted on the right side.\n\nThe ordinary Roman cassock worn by Roman Catholic clerics (as distinct from that worn as choir dress) is black except in tropical countries, where because of the heat it is white and usually without shoulder cape (pellegrina). Coloured piping and buttons are added in accordance with rank: black for priests, purple for chaplains of His Holiness; amaranth red for bishops, protonotaries apostolic and Honorary Prelates; and scarlet red for cardinals.\n\nThe 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that for all of them, even cardinals, the dress for ordinary use may be a simple black cassock without coloured trim.\n\nA band cincture or sash, known also as a fascia, may be worn with the cassock. The Instruction on the dress of prelates specifies that the two ends that hang down by the side have silk fringes, abolishing the sash with tassels. A black faille fascia is worn by priests, deacons, and major seminarians, while a purple faille fascia is used by bishops, protonotaries apostolic, honorary prelates, and chaplains of His Holiness, when wearing a cassock with coloured trim. A black watered-silk fascia is permitted for priests attached to the papal household, a purple watered-silk fascia for bishops attached to the papal household (for example, Apostolic Nuncios), and a scarlet watered-silk fascia for cardinals. The Pope wears a white watered-silk fascia, sometimes with his coat of arms on the ends.\nIn choir dress, chaplains of His Holiness wear their purple-trimmed black cassocks with a cotta, but bishops, protonotaries apostolic, and honorary prelates use (with a cotta or, in the case of bishops, a rochet and mozzetta) cassocks that are fully purple (this purple corresponds more closely with a Roman purple and is approximated as fuchsia) with scarlet trim, while those of cardinals are fully scarlet with scarlet trim. Cardinals have the additional distinction of having both choir cassock sleeves and the fascia made of scarlet watered-silk. The \"cut\" of the choir cassock is still a Roman-cut or French-cut Roman cassock.\n\nIn the past, a cardinal's cassock was made entirely of watered silk, with a train that could be fastened at the back of the cassock. This train was abolished by the \"motu proprio\" \"Valde solliciti\" of Pope Pius XII with effect from 1 January 1953. With the same \"motu proprio\", the Pope ordered that the violet cassock (then used in penitential periods and in mourning) be made of wool, not silk, and in February 1965, under Pope Paul VI, a circular of the Sacred Ceremonial Congregation abolished the use of watered silk also for the red cassock.\n\nAn elbow-length shoulder cape, open in front, is sometimes worn with the cassock, either fixed to it or detachable. It is known as a pellegrina. It is distinct from the mozzetta, which is buttoned in front and is worn over a rochet.\n\nThe general rule of the Roman Catholic Church is that the pellegrina may be worn with the cassock by cardinals and bishops. In 1850, the year in which he restored the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, Pope Pius IX was understood to grant to all priests there the privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white caped cassock. Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the cassock has been a sign of a Roman Catholic priest in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, although sometimes imitated by Anglican priests.\n\nIn his 1909 book, \"Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church\", John Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa proposed the use of the English word \"simar\", instead of the word \"cassock\", for the garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as distinct from the cassock proper. Others too have made the same distinction between the \"simar\" (with pellegrina) and the \"cassock\" (without), but many scholars disagree with Nainfa's distinction. More particularly, documents of the Holy See make no such distinction, using the term \"cassock\" or \"vestis talaris\" whether a pellegrina is attached or is not. Thus the 1969 instruction states that, for cardinals and bishops, \"the elbow-length cape, trimmed in the same manner as this \"cassock\", may be worn over it\". \"Cassock\", rather than \"simar\", is the term that is usually applied to the dress of Popes and other Catholic ecclesiastics. The instruction also gives no support to Nainfa's claim that the cassock with shoulder cape should not be worn in church services, which moreover would be of difficult application, since the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a single garment, with a non-detachable pellegrina.\n\nNainfa wrote that at that time the garment with shoulder cape was in Italian called a \"zimarra\", a term, however, that in that language is today used rather of a historical loose-fitting overgown, quite unlike the close-fitting cassock with pellegrina worn by Catholic clergy, and similar to the fur-lined that was used in northern Europe. Images of the historical zimarra as worn by women can be seen at \"Dressing the Italian Way\" and \"The Italian Showcase\".\n\nIn cold weather, the manto, an ankle-length cape with or without shoulder cape, or the greca, also known as the douillette, an ankle-length double-breasted overcoat, is traditionally worn over the cassock. For bishops and priests both the manto and greca are solid black in colour, while for the pope the manto is red and the greca is white.\n\nCassocks are sometimes worn by seminarians studying for the priesthood, by religious brothers, by lay people when assisting with the liturgy in church, such as altar servers, and by members of choirs (frequently with cotta or, more usually in Anglican churches, surplice).\n\nThe Anglican church uses single and double-breasted cassocks. For many this is to indicate tradition (single-breasted in the Anglo-Catholic tradition and double-breasted in the evangelical end of the church).\n\nThe double-breasted cassock fastens at the shoulders on the opposing side of the breast and at the waist with one concealed button. The latter usually has a single small stem-button sewn at centre front about 12–15 cm / 4½–6\" below the centre-front neck line which is used to secure the academic hood, worn for Choir Dress.\n\nThe single-breasted cassock worn by Anglicans traditionally has thirty-nine buttons as signifying the \"Thirty-Nine Articles\" or as some would prefer Forty Stripes Save One. \n\nCassocks are often worn without a cinture and some opt for a buckled belt.\n\nBlack is the most common colour for priests, readers, virgers, and server cassocks. Lighter colours, such as white are used in tropical countries and some cathedrals have colours specific for their location. Piping is also used in the Anglican church to indicate position held with red being used for Deans, Archdeacons and Cathedral Canons. Bishops and Archbishops often wear purple cassocks. This has been practise since the 19th century. More recently the Archbishops have chosen to wear black, this can be seen in the ministries of Rowan Williams and Justin Welby. Scarlet cassocks are properly worn only by Chaplains to the Queen and by members of Royal foundations such as Westminster Abbey and some Cambridge college chapels.\nCassocks are sometimes also worn by readers, altar servers, and choir members, when they do this is the double-breasted style. Readers and altar servers usually wear black cassocks, but those worn by choirs are usually coloured.\n\nIn the Evangelical Lutheran Churches of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and the North German Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and Lübeck, clergy wear the cassock with the ruff as vestments.\n\nThe Cassock is also worn in American Lutheran churches as often as the clerical shirts and collar. It is customary to wear it on special high holidays such as Good Friday and Ash Wednesday.\n\nIn the Church of Scotland, and Presbyterian churches which trace their heritage back to the Scottish church, they typically use the Anglican style of cassock. In addition, it is not uncommon to see full-length cassocks worn in the blue of the Flag of Scotland, which is also tied to the academic dress of the University of St Andrews. As is the custom within the Church of England, ministers of the Church of Scotland who are chaplains to the royal family also wear a scarlet cassock. Over this is typically worn a preaching gown or the academic gown of the minister. During the Edwardian and Victorian era, it was common to see a shortened, double-breasted black silk cassock worn under the gown. It generally reached to the knees and was tied with a simple cincture. However, with the liturgical movement of the 20th century, the classic cassock came back into fashion.\n\nPresbyterians in Canada tend to follow the custom of the Church of Scotland, whereas Presbyterians in the United States typically wear an American Geneva gown over a sleeveless cassock or a non-cuffed gown over an Anglican or Roman style cassock. The American Geneva gown is often supplied with a cuff sewn into the double-bell sleeve (this innovation is a remnant of the cassock sleeve that was formerly worn underneath).\n\nAs is the practice in the Anglican churches, cassocks may be worn by others who are not ministers. Ordained elders and deacons, as they serve as worship leaders, readers, and administer communion may also wear cassocks which tend to be black. Those worn by choirs and other worship leaders are usually coloured (for instance, The Shadyside Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) choir is dressed in red cassocks under white surplices).\n\nIn Eastern Christianity there are two types of cassock: the Inner Cassock and the Outer Cassock or Rason. Monastics always wear a black cassock. There is no rule about colouration for non-monastic clergy, but black is the most common. Blue or grey are also seen frequently, while white is sometimes worn for Pascha. In the Eastern Churches, cassocks are not dress for any lay ministry. Generally, one has to be blessed to wear a cassock usually in the case of exercising a clerical duty.\n\n\nThe \"cassock\" can also refer to a loose-fitting, pullover, hip-length jacket worn by ordinary soldiers in the 17th century. A cassock has attached sleeves and is open down the sides, similar to a mandilion. Such garments are popularly recognized as the formal uniform of the Musketeers of the Guard in \"The Three Musketeers\" – though this is suspect historically.\n\n"}

Beignets may also be made from other types of dough, including yeast dough.\n\nThe tradition of beignets dates to the time of Ancient Rome, although the practice of frying food itself extends much further back; references to the ancient Greeks frying various foods in olive oils during the 5th century BC exist, and other cultures have adapted their own methods as well. The term beignet can be applied to two varieties, depending on the type of pastry. The French-style beignet in the United States, has the specific meaning of deep-fried choux pastry. Beignets can also be made with yeast pastry, which might be called \"boules de Berlin\" in French, referring to Berliner doughnuts which have a spherical shape (in other words, they do not have the typical doughnut hole) filled with fruit or jam.\n\nIn Corsica, beignets made with chestnut flour (\"Beignets de farine de châtaigne\") are known as fritelli.\n\nDonuts (doughnuts) in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada are referred to as both \"Beigne\" and \"Beignet\" in French.\n\nBeignets are commonly known in New Orleans as a breakfast served with powdered sugar on top. They are traditionally prepared right before consumption to be eaten fresh and hot. Variations of fried dough can be found across cuisines internationally; however, the origin of the term beignet is specifically French. In the United States, beignets have been popular within New Orleans Creole cuisine and are customarily served as a dessert or in some sweet variation. They were brought to New Orleans in the 18th century by French colonists, from \"the old mother country\", also brought by Acadians, and became a large part of home-style Creole cooking, variations often including banana or plantain – popular fruits in the port city. Today, Café du Monde is a popular New Orleans food destination specializing in beignets with powdered sugar, coffee with chicory, and café au lait. Beignets were declared the official state doughnut of Louisiana in 1986.\n\nIngredients used to prepare beignets traditionally include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "331347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331347", "title": "Misnagdim", "text": "Misnagdim\n\nMisnagdim (; also \"Mitnagdim\"; singular \"misnaged\"/\"mitnaged\") is a Hebrew word meaning \"opponents\". The term \"Misnagdim\" commonly refers to opponents of Hasidism. The term \"Misnagdim\" gained a common usage among Jews living in Europe as the term that referred to Ashkenazi Jews who opposed the rise and spread of early Hasidic Judaism.\n\nThe rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as heretical. \n\nHasidism's founder was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (ca.1700-1760), known as the \"Baal Shem Tov\" (\"master of a good name\" usually applied to a saintly Jew who was also a wonder-worker), or simply by the acronym \"Besht\" (); he taught that man's relationship with God depended on immediate religious experience, in addition to knowledge and observance of the details of the Torah and Talmud.\n\nMuch of Judaism was still fearful of the messianic movements of the Sabbateans and the Frankists (followers of the messianic claimant Jacob Frank (1726–1791)). Many rabbis suspected Hasidism of an intimate connection with these movements.\n\nThe characteristically \"Lithuanian\" approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study. Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism, to the extent that in popular perception \"Lithuanian\" and \"misnaged\" became virtually interchangeable terms. In fact, however, a sizable minority of Lithuanian Jews belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim, Karlin-Stolin (Pinsk) and Koidanov.\n\nThe first documented opposition to the Hasidic Movement was from the Jewish community in Shklow, Belarus in the year 1772. Rabbis and community leaders voiced concerns about the Hasidim because they were making their way to Belarus. The rabbis sent letters forbidding Hasidic prayer houses, urging the burning of Hasidic texts, and humiliating prominent Hasidic leaders. The rabbis imprisoned the Hasidic leaders in an attempt to isolate them from coming into contact with their followers.\n\nThe bans of excommunication against Hasidic Jews in 1772 were accompanied by the public ripping up of several early Hasidic pamphlets. The Vilna Gaon, Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, a prominent rabbi, galvanized opposition to Hasidic Judaism. He believed that the claims of miracles and visions made by Hasidic Jews were lies and delusions. A key point of opposition was that the Vilna Gaon maintained that greatness in Torah and observance must come through natural human efforts at Torah study without relying on any external \"miracles\" and \"wonders\", whereas the \"Ba'al Shem Tov\" was more focused on bringing encouragement and raising the morale of the Jewish people, especially following the Chmelnitzki pogroms (1648–1654) and the aftermath of disillusionment in the Jewish masses following the millennial excitement heightened by the failed messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. Opponents of Hasidim held that Hasidim viewed their rebbes in an idolatrous fashion.\n\nMost of the changes made by the Hasidim were the product of the Hasidic approach to Kabbalah, particularly as expressed by Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534–1572), known as \"the ARI\" and his disciples, particularly Rabbi Chaim Vital (1543–1620). Both Misnagdim and hassidim were greatly influenced by the ARI, but the legalistic Misnagdim feared in Hasidism what they perceived as disturbing parallels to the Sabatean movement. An example of such an idea was the concept that the entire universe is completely nullified to God. Depending on how this idea was preached and interpreted, it could give rise to pantheism, universally acknowledged as a heresy, or lead to immoral behavior, since elements of Kabbalah can be misconstrued to de-emphasize ritual and to glorify sexual metaphors as a deeper means of grasping some inner hidden notions in the Torah based on the Jews' intimate relationship with God. If God is present in everything, and if divinity is to be grasped in erotic terms, then -- Misnagdim feared -- Hasidim might feel justified in neglecting legal distinctions between the holy and the profane, and in engaging in inappropriate sexual activities.\n\nThe stress of Jewish prayer over Torah study and the Hasidic reinterpretation of \"Torah l'shma\" (Torah study for its own sake), was seen as a rejection of traditional Judaism.\n\nHasidim did not follow the traditional Ashkenazi prayer rite, and instead used a rite which is a combination of Ashkenazi and Sephardi rites (Nusach Sefard), based upon Kabbalistic concepts from Rabbi Isaac Luria of Safed. This was seen as a rejection of the traditional Ashkenazi liturgy and, due to the resulting need for separate synagogues, a breach of communal unity.\n\nHasidic Jews also added some halakhic stringencies on Kashrus, the laws of keeping kosher. They made certain changes in how livestock were slaughtered and in who was considered a reliable mashgiach (supervisor of kashrut). The end result was that they essentially considered some kosher food as less kosher. This was seen as a change of traditional Judaism, and an over stringency of halakha (Jewish law), and, again, a breach of communal unity.\n\nWith the rise of what would become known as Hasidism in the late 18th century, established conservative rabbinic authorities actively worked to stem its growth. Whereas before the breakaway Hasidic synagogues were occasionally opposed but largely checked, its spread into Lithuania and Belarus prompted a concerted effort by opposing rabbis to halt its spread.\n\nIn late 1772, after uniting the scholars of Brisk, Minsk and other Belorussian and Lithuanian communities, the Vilna Gaon then issued the first of many polemical letters against the nascent Hasidic movement, which was included in the anti-Hasidic anthology, \"Zemir aritsim ve-ḥarvot tsurim\" (1772). The letters published in the anthology included pronouncements of excommunication against Hasidic leaders on the basis of their worship and habits, all of which were seen as unorthodox by the Misnagdim. This included but was not limited to unsanctioned places of worship and ecstatic prayers, as well as charges of smoking, dancing, and the drinking of alcohol. In total, this was seen to be a radical departure from the Misnagdic norm of asceticism, scholarship, and stoic demeanor in worship and general conduct, and was viewed as a development that needed to be suppressed.\n\nBetween 1772 and 1791, other Misnagdic tracts of this type would follow, all targeting the Hasidim in an effort to contain and eradicate them from Jewish communities. The harshest of these denouncements came between 1785 and 1815 combined with petitioning of the Russian government to outlaw the Hasidim on the grounds of them being spies, traitors, and subversives.\n\nHowever, this would not be realized. After the death of the Vilna Gaon in 1797 and the partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795, the regions of Poland where there were disputes between Misnagdim and Hasidim came under the control of governments that did not want to take sides in inner-Jewish conflicts, but that wanted instead to abolish Jewish autonomy. In 1804 Hasidism was legalized by the Imperial Russian government, and efforts by the Misnagdim to contain the now-widespread Hasidim were stymied.\n\nBy the mid-19th century most of non-Hasidic Judaism had discontinued its struggle with Hasidism and had reconciled itself to the establishment of the latter as a fact. One reason for the reconciliation between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim was the rise of the Haskalah movement. While many followers of this movement were observant, it was also used by the absolutist state to change Jewish education and culture, which both Misnagdim and Hasidim perceived as a greater threat to religion than they represented to each other. In the modern era, Misnagdim continue to thrive, but they prefer to be called \"Litvish\" or \"Yeshivish.\"\n\n\nMaps:\n"}

The bun marks the end of Lent and different parts of the hot cross bun have a certain meaning, including the cross representing the crucifixion of Jesus, and the spices inside signifying the spices used to embalm him at his burial. They are now available all year round in some places. Hot cross buns may go on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand as early as New Year's Day or after Christmas.\n\nIn many historically Christian countries, plain buns made without dairy products (forbidden in Lent until Palm Sunday) are traditionally eaten hot or toasted during Lent, beginning with the evening of Shrove Tuesday (the evening before Ash Wednesday) to midday Good Friday.\n\nThe ancient Greeks may have marked cakes with a cross.\n\nOne theory is that the Hot Cross Bun originates from St Albans, where Brother Thomas Rodcliffe, a 14th Century monk at St Albans Abbey, developed a similar recipe called an 'Alban Bun' and distributed the bun to the local poor on Good Friday, starting in 1361.\n\nIn the time of Elizabeth I of England (1592), the London Clerk of Markets issued a decree forbidding the sale of hot cross buns and other spiced breads, except at burials, on Good Friday, or at Christmas. The punishment for transgressing the decree was forfeiture of all the forbidden product to the poor. As a result of this decree, hot cross buns at the time were primarily made in home kitchens. Further attempts to suppress the sale of these items took place during the reign of James I of England/James VI of Scotland (1603–1625). The first definite record of hot cross buns comes from a London street cry: \"Good Friday comes this month, the old woman runs. With one or two a penny hot cross buns\", which appeared in \"Poor Robin's Almanac\" for 1733. Food historian Ivan Day states, \"The buns were made in London during the 18th century. But when you start looking for records or recipes earlier than that, you hit nothing.\"\n\nEnglish folklore includes many superstitions surrounding hot cross buns. One of them says that buns baked and served on Good Friday will not spoil or grow mouldy during the subsequent year. Another encourages keeping such a bun for medicinal purposes. A piece of it given to someone ill is said to help them recover. If taken on a sea voyage, hot cross buns are said to protect against shipwreck. If hung in the kitchen, they are said to protect against fires and ensure that all breads turn out perfectly. The hanging bun is replaced each year.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the major supermarkets produce variations on the traditional recipe such as toffee, orange-cranberry, and apple-cinnamon.\n\nIn Australia, coffee-flavoured buns are also sold in some bakeries. There are also sticky date and caramel versions, as well as mini versions of the traditional bun. Other newer variations that can be purchased from major supermarkets include chocolate and cherry, butterscotch, banana and caramel and white chocolate and raspberry.\n\nThe not cross bun is a variation on the hot cross bun. It uses the same ingredients but instead of having a \"cross\" on top, it has a smiley face in reference to it being \"not cross\" in the sense of not angry. The not cross bun was first sold commercially in 2014 by an Australian bakery, Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses, in response to supermarkets selling hot cross buns as early as Boxing Day (26 December).\n\nIn the Czech Republic, \"mazanec\" is a similar cake or sweet bread eaten at Easter. It often has a cross marked on top.\n\nThe traditional method for making the cross on top of the bun is to use shortcrust pastry; however, more recently recipes have recommended a paste consisting of flour and water. In the United States, the cross is often made with white sugar icing.\n"}
{"id": "332366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332366", "title": "Safety pin", "text": "Safety pin\n\nThe safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.\n\nSafety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin, or loincloth pin, are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), or modern loincloths, as the safety clasp, while remaining ingestion hazard, prevents the baby or boy from being jabbed. Similarly, they can be used to patch torn or damaged clothing. Safety pins can also be used as an accessory in jewelry, like earrings, chains, and wristbands. Sometimes they are used to attach an embroidered patch. Size 3 is often used in quilting and may be labelled for purchase as a \"quilting pin\". Size 4 and larger may be called \"blanket pins\" and deemed acceptable as kilt pins for informal dress, depending upon design and appearance.\n\nThe fibula, a form of brooch, was invented by the Myceaneans on the Greek Peloponnesus between the 14th and 13th Century BC, and is considered an early precursor to a safety pin since they were used in a similar manner. Fibulae were used by Greek women and men to help secure tunics.\n\nAmerican mechanic Walter Hunt is regarded as the inventor of the safety pin that bears resemblance to those used today. The safety pin included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place. Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849, although the company no longer makes these.\n\nHunt made the invention in order to pay off a $15 debt to a friend. He used a piece of brass wire that was about 8 inches long and made a coil in the center of the wire so it would open up when released. The clasp at one end was devised in order to shield the sharp edge from the user.\n\nAfter being issued U.S. patent #6,281 on April 10, 1849, Hunt sold the patent to W. R. Grace and Company for $400 (roughly $,000 in dollars). Using that money, Hunt then paid the $15 owed to a friend and kept the remaining amount of $385 for himself. What Hunt failed to realize is that in the years to follow, W.R. Grace and Company would make millions of dollars in profits from his invention.\n\nThe sharpened pin, that is attached to a coiled wire is connected with a cap that is hooked at the end of the wire. Pushing the pin into the opening of the cap secures the safety of the pin, and the clasp is the closed.\n\nWhilst the cover on the safety pin makes it less likely to hurt someone, a version was invented specially for use with babies' nappies, the nappy pin. This is larger and stronger than the typical safety pin. Modern nappy pins have the sliding cap to lock the pin.\n\nWhile the cover on the safety pin makes it less likely to hurt someone, a version was invented especially for use with babies' diapers, the diaper pin. This is larger and stronger than the typical safety pin. Modern diaper pins have either a sliding cap to lock the pin or a S shaped channel inside the cap.\n\nThe laryngologist Dr. Chevalier Jackson devised special instruments for removing swallowed safety pins. Because small children often swallowed them and open pins could be lodged dangerously in their throats, Jackson called them \"danger pins\" and sometimes displayed arrangements of those he had extracted. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries, including Turkey, today.\n\nDuring the emergence of punk rock in the late seventies, safety pins became associated with the genre, its followers and fashion. Some claim the look was taken originally from Richard Hell whom the British punks saw in pictures, and whose style they adopted. This is disputed by a number of artists from the first wave of British punks, most notably Johnny Rotten, who insists that safety pins were originally incorporated for more practical reasons, for example, to remedy \"the arse of your pants falling out\". British punk fans, after seeing the clothing worn by such punk forerunners, then incorporated safety pins into their own wardrobe as clothing decoration or as piercings, shifting the purpose of the pins from practicality to fashion. The safety pin subsequently has become an image associated with punk rock by media and popular culture outlets.\n\nSafety pins hold a value in certain cultures and traditions. In India pins are kept over generations and passed down to daughters. Ukrainians use pins as a way to ward off evil spirits when attached to children's clothing. In other countries a safety pin is a form of good luck.\n\n"}
{"id": "333059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333059", "title": "Albanian cuisine", "text": "Albanian cuisine\n\nThe Albanian cuisine ( — ) is a representative of the cuisine of the Mediterranean. It is also an example of the Mediterranean diet based on the importance of olive oil, fruits, vegetables and fish. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse in consequence of the environmental factors that are more importantly suitable for the cultivation of nearly all kinds of herbs, vegetables and fruits. Olive oil is the most ancient and commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts.\n\nHospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honour, called \"besa\", resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude. \n\nAlbanian cuisine can be divided into three major regional cuisines. The cuisine of the northern region has a rural, coastal and mountainous origin. Meat, fish and vegetables are central to the cuisine of the northern region. The people there use many kinds of ingredients, which usually grow in the region including potatoes, carrots, maizes, beans, cabbages but also cherries, walnuts and almonds. Garlic and onions are as well important components to the local cuisine and added to almost every dish.\n\nThe cuisine of the central region is threefold of rural, mountainous and coastal. The central region is the flattest and rich in vegetation and biodiversity as well as culinary specialties. It has Mediterranean characteristics due to its proximity to the sea, which is rich in fish. Dishes here include several meat specialties and desserts of all kinds. \n\nIn the south, the cuisine is composed of two components: the rural products of the field including dairy products, citrus fruits and olive oil, and coastal products, i.e. seafood. Those regions are particularly conducive to raising animals, as pastures and feed resources are abundant.\n\nBesides garlic, onions are arguably the country's most widely used ingredient. Albania is ranked second in the world in terms of onion consumption per capita.\n\nIn his 17th-century work \"Seyahatnâme\" the Ottoman writer Evliya Çelebi described several foods that he ate in the \"vicinity of Ohrid\" at the \"green mountain pasture of Istok\":\nWe went from fold to fold, staying in tents, eating the yoghurt and cheeses and beestings and curds and cream with honey and omelets with honey, drinking the buttermilk and whey, savoring the kebabs of roasted lamb and trout, quaffing water from the ice-cold streams and various kinds of honey sherbets, snacking on a thousand kinds of herbs and tendrils and sorrel and wild strawberries and sour cherries, and generally having a good time.\n\nThe strategic location of Albania in the western Balkan Peninsula with a direct proximity to the Mediterranean Sea has a large influence on Albanian cuisine. Many foods that are common in the Mediterranean Basin, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, fruits and vegetables, are prominent in the Albanian cooking tradition. Albania has a distinctly Mediterranean climate. Across the country's territory, there are a wide range of microclimates due to differing soil types and topography that allow a variety of products to be grown. Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, figs and olives thrive in the country.\n\nEvery region has its own typical breakfast. Breakfast often consists of a light meal. Fresh bread is frequently eaten and served with butter, cheese, jam and yogurt, accompanied with olives, coffee, milk, tea or raki. It is common to have only fruit or a slice of bread and a cup of coffee or tea for breakfast. Coffee and tea is enjoyed both in homes or at the many cafés that feature in towns and cities throughout the country.\n\nLunch is traditionally the biggest meal of the day for Albanians. Everyone in Albania enjoys this lunch break, from school children to shop workers and government officials. Traditionally, people go back to their houses to have lunch with their families, but it is now common to have lunch with groups of friends at restaurants or cafeterias. Lunch sometimes consists of \"gjellë\", a main dish of slowly cooked meat with various vegetables, accompanied by a salad of fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, onions and olives. Salads are typically served with meat dishes and are dressed with salt, virgin olive oil, white vinegar or lemon juice. Grilled or fried vegetables and sausages and various forms of omelettes are also eaten during lunch, accompanied by coffee, tea, fruit juices and milk.\n\nDinner in Albania is a smaller meal, often consisting only of a variety of breads, meat, fresh fish or seafood, cheese, eggs and various kind of vegetables, similar to breakfast, or possibly sandwiches.\n\nLocated in Southern Europe with a direct proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the Albanian cuisine features a wide range of fresh fruits, growing naturally in the fertile Albanian soil and under the warm sun. In consideration of being an agricultural country, Albania is a significant fruit importer and exporter. Besides citrus fruits, cherries, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are among the most cultivated fruits. A lot of Albanians keep various fruit trees in their yards across the fertile country's territory. Fresh and dried fruits are eaten as snacks and desserts.\n\nFruits that are traditionally associated with Albanian cuisine include apple, grape, olive, orange, nectarine, blackberry, cherry, persimmon, pomegranate, figs, watermelon, avocado, lemon, peach, plum, strawberries, raspberry, mulberry and carnelian cherry.\n\nA wide variety of vegetables are always used in Albanian cooking. Due to the different climate and soil conditions across Albania, cultivars of cabbages, turnips, beetroots, beans, potatoes, leeks and mushrooms can be found in a rich variety. Dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions such as in the remote Albanian Alps, where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season. Particularly used vegetables include onion, garlic, tomato, cucumber, carrot, pepper, spinach, lettuce, grape leaves, bean, eggplant and zucchini.\n\nHerbs are very popular. A wide variety are readily available at supermarkets or local produce stands across the country. The proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the ideal climatic conditions allows the cultivation of about 250 aromatic and medical plants. Albania is among the leading producers and exporter of herbs in the world. Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of oregano, thyme, sage, salvia, rosemary and yellow gentian. Most commonly used herbs and other seasonings in Albanian cooking include artichoke, basil, chili pepper, cinnamon, coriander, lavender, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, bay, vanilla, saffron.\n\nTea is a widely consumed beverage throughout Albania and particularly served at cafés, restaurants or at home.

It is believed that because of this diet Albania has a very high life expectancy when its economic power is compared to other countries, characterized by some researchers as the \"Albanian paradox\". This causes the country to not be affected by cardiovascular and coronary diseases when compared to countries like Hungary or Poland which have a two-to-three-times higher death rate from those diseases.\n\n"}
{"id": "333355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333355", "title": "Crêpe", "text": "Crêpe\n\nA crêpe or crepe ( or , , ) is a type of very thin pancake. Crêpes are usually of two types: \"sweet crêpes\" (\"crêpes sucrées\") and \"savoury galettes\" (\"crêpes salées\"). Crêpes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to flambéed crêpes Suzette or elaborate savoury galettes. While crêpes are often associated with Brittany, a region in the northwest of France, their consumption is widespread in France, Belgium, Canada, and many parts of Europe, North Africa, Lebanon, and the Southern Cone of South America. \n\nCrêpes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (τίγανος), meaning \"frying pan\", which in English is literally translated to Pancakes. The French term, crêpe, derives from the Latin \"crispa\", meaning with \"creases\". The name \"galette\" came from the French word \"galet\" (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\nIn France, crêpes are traditionally served on Candlemas (\"La Chandeleur\"), 2 February. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Crêpes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Crêpes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Crêpe Day\", \"National Crêpe Day\", or \"day of the Crêpe \"), referring to the tradition of offering crêpes. The belief was that catching the crêpe with a frying pan after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year. The roundness, and golden colour from being fried in butter, of the crêpe resembles the sun and its rays. This symbolism also applies to the coin held in the person's hand.\n\nSweet crêpes are generally made with wheat flour (\"farine de froment\"). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of breakfast or as a dessert. Common fillings include Nutella spread, preserves, sugar (granulated or powdered), maple syrup, golden syrup, lemon juice, whipped cream, fruit spreads, custard, and sliced soft fruits or confiture.\n\nSavory crêpes are made with non-wheat flours such as buckwheat. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. Common savoury fillings for crêpes served for lunch or dinner are cheese, ham, and eggs, ratatouille, mushrooms, artichoke (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\nBatters can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar. Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the crêpe and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nA variety of crepe is also made in India which uses multi-grain flour, eggs, curd and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called Thalipeeth\n\nA crêperie may be a takeaway restaurant or stall, serving crêpes as a form of fast food or street food, or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or café.\n\nCrêperies are typical of Brittany in France; however, crêperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a crêpe may be served as both a main meal or a dessert, crêperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as baguettes. They may also serve coffee, tea, buttermilk, and cider (a popular drink to accompany crêpes).\n\nCrêpes are especially popular throughout France. The common ingredients include flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a pinch of salt. Crêpes are usually of two types: \"sweet crêpes\" (\"crêpes sucrées\") made with wheat flour and slightly sweetened; and \"savoury galettes\" (\"crêpes salées\") made with buckwheat flour and unsweetened. The name \"galette\" came from the French word \"galet\" (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. \"Mille crêpes\"() is a French cake made of many crêpe layers. The word \"mille\" means \"a thousand\", implying the many layers of crêpe. Another standard French and Belgian crêpe is the \"crêpe Suzette\", a crêpe with lightly grated orange peel and liqueur (usually Grand Marnier) which is subsequently lit upon presentation.\n\nEnglish pancakes are like wheat flour crêpes, and are served with golden syrup or lemon juice and sugar. Swedish pancakes, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to the French crêpes. In some of the Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in Swedish and räiskäle in Finnish, which resemble the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has plättar/lettu which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter (fläskpannkaka); these are baked in the oven. Potato pancakes called raggmunk contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing rårakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is saffron pancake from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special \"Swedish pancake\" is the äggakaka (eggcake), also called skånsk äggakaka (scanian eggcake). It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1½ to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry jam) or sugar.\nThe 49er flapjack is a sourdough crepe which is popular in the United States, getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the California Gold Rush. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake the 49er is sometimes served with lingonberry sauce, although most often it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar, or served open-faced and topped with maple syrup.\n\nCherry Kijafa Crêpes are also often common and are made with a traditional crêpe base, but filled with cherries simmered in a Kijafa wine sauce.\n\n\"Crêpe dentelle\" is a crispy biscuit made with a very thin layer of crêpe folded in a cigar shape and then baked. It is usually enjoyed with a hot drink during the \"goûter\", in France.\n\nIn Norwegian, crêpes are called \"pannekake\", in most German regions \"Pfannkuchen\". In Swedish, a crêpe is called \"pannkaka\" in southern regions while being called \"plättar\" in the north, in Danish, \"pandekager\" (\"pancakes\"), in Icelandic it is called \"pönnukaka\", in Finnish a crêpe is called either \"ohukainen\" or \"lettu\" or \"räiskäle\", in Dutch it is a \"pannenkoek\" or \"flensje\", and in Afrikaans a \"pannekoek\", which is usually served with cinnamon sugar. In the Spanish regions of Galicia and Asturias, they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called \"filloas\", and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called \"fayueles\" or \"frixuelos\", and in Turkey, \"akıtma\".\n\nIn areas of central Europe, formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian empire, there is a thin pancake comparable to a crêpe that in Austro-Bavarian is called \"Palatschinken\"; in ; and in Bosnian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Czech, Croatian, and ; in . In the Balkan region such as the countries of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, \"palačinka\" or \"pallaçinka\" may be eaten with fruit jam, quark cheese, sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream Nutella, while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in palačinci are called \"Palačinkara\" in the region. In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the blintz. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians \"palacsinta\", which it derives from the Romanian \"plăcintă\", which comes in turn from classical Latin \"placenta\" (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian \"plăcintă\" is more similar to a pie, and the crêpes are actually called \"clătită\".\n\nCrêpes have also long been popular in Japan and Malaysia, with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called crêperies. In Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, they are called \"panqueques\" and are often eaten with dulce de leche. Various other French foods, such as crêpes, souffles, and quiche, have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments. Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making crêpes but they have also put their own spin on the crêpe with new types such as the hamburger and pizza crêpe. In Mexico, crêpes are known as \"crepas\", and were introduced during the 19th century by the French and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with \"cajeta\" (similar to dulce de leche), or as a savoury dish when filled with \"Huitlacoche\" (corn smut), which is considered a delicacy.\n\nDuring the Russian celebration of Maslenitsa (Russian Butter Week), one of the most popular foods is blini, or crêpes. Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, crêpes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the Orthodox church. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of crêpes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for kefir. Also different oils can be added or substituted. Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with caviar, cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \nIn addition to crêperies and crêpe franchises, there are crêpe manufacturers that use modern equipment to produce crêpes in bulk.\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a crêpe made of fermented rice batter is called a dosa, which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a crepe made of gram flour is called Pudlaa/Poodla, with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called patibola and is sweet in taste due to milk, jaggery or sugar. The injera of Ethiopian/Eritrean/Somali/Yemeni cuisine is often described as a thick crêpe. Also in Somalia, Malawaḥ (Somali: Malawax) is very similar to a crêpe. It is mostly eaten at breakfast.\n\nThe names for thin crêpes in other parts of Europe are:\n\n"}
{"id": "333381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333381", "title": "Low whistle", "text": "Low whistle\n\nThe low whistle, or concert whistle, is a variation of the traditional tin whistle/pennywhistle, distinguished by its lower pitch and larger size. It is most closely associated with the performances of British and Irish artists such as Finbar Furey and his son Martin Furey, Old Blind Dogs, Michael McGoldrick, \"Riverdance\", Lunasa and Davy Spillane, and is increasingly accepted as a feature of Celtic music. The low whistle is often used for the playing of airs and slow melodies due to its haunting and delicate sound. However, it is also becoming used more often for the playing of Irish and British jigs, reels and hornpipes, it being easier to produce some ornamentation on the whistle, due to the size of the finger holes. \n\nThe most common low whistle is the \"Low D\", pitched one octave below the traditional D whistle. A whistle is generally classed as a \"low\" whistle if its lowest note is the G above middle C or lower. Whistles higher than this are termed \"soprano\" or \"high\" whistles when a distinction is necessary. Low whistles operate on the same principles, and are generally fingered in the same way as traditional pennywhistles although for many, a \"piper's grip\" may be required due to the distance between the holes. They belong to the same woodwind instrument family of end-blown fipple flutes.\n\nThough the tone of this instrument varies subtly among makers, low whistles are generally characterised by a more breathy, flute-like sound than traditional tin whistles.\n\nWhile the precise history of the low whistle is often debated, it is known that various kinds of vertical fipple flutes have existed in antiquity. The fipple flutes developed during the 16th century were the ancestors of today's low whistle, carrying through from early transverse flutes the six-holed design tradition and conical bore shape. They were originally of wooden construction, but the late 17th century saw more extensive use of metals such as brass and nickel. The metal was usually rolled and soldered, and further developments included the use of a tuning slide. These metal vertical flutes were found throughout Ireland, Britain, the Scandinavian peninsula, Canada and Flanders.\n\nEnglish flute maker and jazz musician Bernard Overton is credited with producing the first modern low whistle in late 1971, which he made with Finbar Furey after Furey's prized Indian bamboo whistle was destroyed while on tour. Unable to repair it, Overton attempted to produce a metal replica and Finbar and himself spent many hours in the shed at the back of Bernard's house in Rugby, designing, testing and ultimately perfecting the flute. The first few were named the Furey/Overton flute but when Bernard gave up his job to hand make them full-time, they decided to market them as The Overton Flute. The first resulting instrument was essentially an oversized tin whistle made of copper pipe with a wooden plug but was quickly replaced by the aluminium one. While Overton was unsatisfied with its performance, he subsequently refined the design with an all-aluminium construction, producing a whistle in A. Impressed, Finbar requested a G version for his trademark \"Lonesome Boatman\" performances. Later, according to Overton,\n\nHence, the expression \"Irish low whistle\" is not denoting an Irish origin, but just an intensive use of this instrument in Ireland and, because of cultural similarity, in the whole British archipelago. While before long several notable instrument makers were producing low whistles, it is usually the Riverdance tour of the 1990s that is credited with giving the low whistle commercial exposure and recognition outside traditional music circles. Of particular note is Davy Spillane, whose work in fusing the sound of traditional instruments such as the low whistle with modern jazz or RnB, for example, has done much for the instrument's visibility. Some of the most famous low whistle players are: Michael McGoldrick, Kevin Crawford, Phil Hardy from England, Davy Spillane, Paddy Keenan, John McSherry from Ireland, Brian Finnegan from Northern Ireland, Fred Morrison, Rory Campbell, Tony Hinnigan and Ross Ainslie from Scotland. \n\nUnlike the regular pennywhistle, the low whistle is a relative newcomer to folk music, and some criticise it for attempting to fill a musical role already well served by the tin whistle and Irish flute. To others it is viewed as a \"transition instrument\" for players seeking to eventually learn the seemingly more prestigious (and expensive) flute or uilleann pipes. While it is true that many skills learnt on the low whistle carry over to these instruments, \"some of the greatest players of traditional music have been associated with the low whistle\" and have helped foster its reputation as a highly versatile and respected instrument in its own right, with a unique and evocative sound. Much like the Irish flat-backed bouzouki, the low whistle can be seen as a product of a period when experiments in instrumentation were commonplace in traditional music, and musicians sought diverse and innovative means of expression.\n"}

It is usually made of metal, often silver or gold but sometimes bronze or some other material. Brooches are frequently decorated with enamel or with gemstones and may be solely for ornament (as in the stomacher) or sometimes serve a practical function as a fastening, perhaps for a cloak.\n\nThe earliest known brooches are from the Bronze Age. As fashions in brooches changed rather quickly, they are important chronological indicators. Many sorts of European brooches found in archaeology are usually referred to by the Latin term fibula.\n\nThe fibula (plural fibulae) is an ornamental clasp used by Romans, Greeks, Germanic peoples and also by Celts and migratory tribes in Europe from the Early Bronze Age. They may have replaced fibulae made of more perishable Neolithic materials, such as bone to as late as 800 AD. Fibulae are useful type-objects: carefully catalogued local typologies, dating and distribution of fibulae can help date finds where neither numismatic nor ceramic materials provide a secure date. Fibulae were shaped somewhat like a large safety pin and were used to hold clothing together. They came in many varieties and held prominent significance for the identity of the wearer, indicating ethnicity (until local costume became Romanized) and class. Elaborately designed fibulae were an important part of Late Antique dress, and simpler ones were part of Roman military equipment.\n\nThe same types of fibulae can often be found on either side of the Roman \"limites\", both among \"Roman\" and \"barbarian\" populations. The cultural interplay of elite objects designed to show status can be quite complex. For example, Lawrence Nees, \"Early Medieval Art\" notes fibulae depicted in ivory diptychs of Stilicho and his entourage:\n\nAncient fibulae are prized items for collectors since they are well preserved in many cases and are not difficult to obtain; divorced from their cultural context, they still present a variety of shapes and decoration.\n\nA distinct tradition of penannular brooches and the related pseudo-penannular types developed in Early Medieval Ireland and Scotland, producing some of the most elaborately decorated brooches ever made, including the Tara Brooch.\n\nFrom the eighteenth century through the Victorian era it was fashionable to incorporate hair and portraiture into a brooch. The practice began as an expression of mourning, then expanded to keepsakes of loved ones who were living. Human hair was encased within the brooch or braided and woven into a band to which clasps were affixed. It was not uncommon for miniature brooch portraits to incorporate ground human hair as pigment.

It is a common breakfast item in traditional American \"farmer\" or \"country\" breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Scraps and trimmings were ground, seasoned and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal.\n\nIt is perhaps most popular for home consumption in rural areas, particularly in the southern states, where it is in the form of fresh or smoked patties or links (the latter might have a natural or synthetic casing, or no form of any casing). Most diners, fast-food restaurants, and family restaurants across the country will also carry one or more versions of it during breakfast hours, whether on a sandwich, in a breakfast platter, or both; some fine-dining establishments will also have a sausage option on their breakfast or brunch menu. The cased link variety is most similar to English-style sausages and has been produced in the United States since colonial days. It is essentially a highly seasoned ground meat, so it does not keep and should be stored and handled appropriately. Newer variations made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can also be found. There are also vegetarian varieties that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. In the United States, the predominant flavorings used for seasoning are black pepper or white pepper and sage, although there are varieties also seasoned with cayenne pepper, or even maple syrup. Some breakfast sausage is flavored with cured bacon.\n\nBreakfast sausage is normally fried in a pan, grilled, or microwaved. Some people like to put maple syrup onto their breakfast sausages. Cooked breakfast sausage is also mixed into egg casseroles before baking. Crumbled and added to white gravy, it is a central component of sausage gravy.\n\nSome common US brands include: P.G. Molinari & Sons, Bob Evans, Jimmy Dean, Swaggerty's Farm, Owen's Sausage, Purnell's Old Folks Country Sausage, Tennessee Pride, Johnsonville, Farmland, and Jones.\n"}
{"id": "335617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335617", "title": "Chorizo", "text": "Chorizo\n\nChorizo (, from Spanish ) or chouriço (from Portuguese ) is a type of pork sausage. Traditionally, it uses natural casings made from intestines, a method used since Roman times.\n\nIn Europe, chorizo is a fermented, cured, smoked sausage, which may be sliced and eaten without cooking, or added as an ingredient to add flavor to other dishes. Elsewhere, some sausages sold as chorizo may not be fermented and cured, and require cooking before eating. Spanish chorizo and Portuguese chouriço get their distinctive smokiness and deep red color from dried, smoked, red peppers (\"pimentón\"/\"pimentão\").\n\nChorizo can be eaten sliced in a sandwich, grilled, fried, or simmered in liquid, including apple cider or other strong alcoholic beverages such as \"aguardiente\". It is also sometimes sliced and used as a pizza topping in a similar manner to salami and pepperoni. It also can be used as a partial replacement for ground (minced) beef or pork.\n\nSeveral different names and spellings are used:\n\nThe etymology of \"chorizo\" is uncertain: it was formerly thought to derive from the Latin \"salsicium\", meaning \"salted\".\nIn English, chorizo is usually pronounced . Non-English pronunciations are sometimes heard, including , mimicking Castilian Spanish pronunciation.\n\nSpanish chorizo is made from coarsely chopped pork and pork fat, seasoned with garlic, \"pimentón\" – a smoked paprika – and salt. It is generally classed as either \"picante\" (spicy) or \"dulce\" (sweet), depending upon the type of \"pimentón\" used. Hundreds of regional varieties of Spanish chorizo, both smoked and unsmoked, may contain herbs, and other ingredients.\nFor example, chorizo de Pamplona is a thicker sausage with the meat more finely ground. Among the varieties is \"chorizo Riojano\" from the La Rioja region, which has PGI protection within the EU.\n\nChorizo is made in short or long and hard or soft varieties; leaner varieties are suited to being eaten at room temperature as an appetizer or tapas, whereas the fattier versions are generally used for cooking. A rule of thumb is that long, thin chorizos are sweet, and short chorizos are spicy, although this is not always the case.\n\nSpain produces many other pork specialties, as well, such as \"lomo embuchado\" or \"salchichón\", cured and air-dried in a similar way. \"Lomo\" is a lean, cured meat to slice, made from the loin of the pig, which is marinated and then air-dried. \"Salchichón\" is another cured sausage without the \"pimentón\" seasoning of chorizo, but flavoured with black peppercorns, instead.\n\nDepending on the variety, chorizo can be eaten sliced without further cooking, sometimes sliced in a sandwich, or grilled, fried, or baked alongside other foodstuffs, and is also an ingredient in several dishes where it accompanies beans, such as \"fabada\" or \"cocido montañés\".\n\nThe version of these dishes \"con todos los sacramentos\" (with all the trimmings, literally sacraments) adds to chorizo other preserved meats such as \"tocino\" (cured bacon) and \"morcilla\" (blood sausage).\n\nPortuguese chouriço is made (at least) with pork, fat, wine, paprika, garlic, and salt. It is then stuffed into natural or artificial casings and slowly dried over smoke. The many different varieties differ in color, shape, seasoning, and taste. Many dishes of Portuguese cuisine and Brazilian cuisine make use of chouriço – \"cozido à portuguesa\" and \"feijoada\" are just two of them.\n\nA popular way to prepare chouriço is partially sliced and flame-cooked over alcohol at the table (\"chouriço à bombeiro\"). Special glazed earthenware dishes with a lattice top are used for this purpose.\n\nIn Johannesburg, South Africa, the high influx of Portuguese immigrants in the 1960s from Portugal and Mozambique tended to settle in a suburb called La Rochelle (Little Portugal) and though most of them have either returned to Portugal or moved on to more affluent suburbs in the city, restaurants in the area, as well as the very well supported annual \"Lusitoland\" fundraiser festival, have chouriço on the menu. \n\nIn the heavily Portuguese counties in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, chouriço is often served with little neck clams and white beans. Chouriço sandwiches on grinder rolls, with sautéed green peppers and onions, are commonly available at local delis and convenience stores. Stuffed quahogs (also known as stuffies), a Rhode Island specialty, usually include chouriço.\n\nIn Portugal, a blood chouriço (\"chouriço de sangue\") similar to black pudding is made, amongst many other types of \"enchidos\", such as \"alheira\", \"linguiça\", \"morcela\", \"farinheira\",\" chouriço de vinho\", \"chouriço de ossos\", \"chourição\", \"cacholeira\", \"paia\", \"paio\", \"paiola\", \"paiote\", and \"tripa enfarinhada\".\n\nBased on the uncooked Spanish \"chorizo fresco\" (fresh chorizo), the Mexican versions of chorizo are made not just from fatty pork, but beef, venison, chicken, turkey, and even tofu, kosher, and vegan versions are made. The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. This type is better known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including the border areas of the United States, and is not frequently found in Europe. It is typically spicier than Spanish and Portuguese varieties of the sausage, and often contains chili peppers that are higher on the Scoville scale. Chorizo and longaniza are not considered the same thing in Mexico.\n\nDue to culinary tradition and the high cost of imported Spanish smoked paprika, Mexican chorizo is usually made with native chili peppers of the same \"Capsicum annuum\" species. Spanish-American cuisine adds vinegar instead of the white wine usually used in Spain.\n\nThe area of around Toluca, known as the capital of chorizo outside of the Iberian Peninsula, specializes in \"green\" chorizo, made with some combination of tomatillo, cilantro, chili peppers, and garlic. The green chorizo recipe is native to Toluca. Most Mexican chorizo is a deep reddish color, and is largely available in two varieties, fresh and dried, though fresh is much more common. Quality chorizo consists of good cuts of pork stuffed in natural casings, while some of the cheapest commercial styles use variety meats stuffed in inedible plastic casing to resemble sausage links. Before consumption, the casing is usually cut open and the sausage is fried in a pan and mashed with a fork until it resembles finely minced ground beef. A common alternative recipe does not have casings. Pork and beef are cured overnight in vinegar and chili powder. Served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it has the finely minced texture mentioned above, and is quite intense in flavor.\n\nIn Mexico, restaurants and food stands make tacos, \"queso fundido\" (or \"choriqueso\"), burritos, and \"tortas\" with cooked chorizo, and it is also a popular pizza topping. \"Chorizo con huevos\" is a popular breakfast dish in Mexico and areas of the United States with Mexican populations. It is made by mixing fried chorizo with scrambled eggs. \"Chorizo con huevos\" is often used in breakfast burritos, tacos, and taquitos. Another popular Mexican recipe is fried chorizo combined with pinto or black refried beans. This combination is often used in \"tortas\" as a spread, or as a side dish where plain refried beans would normally be served. In Mexico, chorizo is also used to make the popular appetizer \"chorizo con queso\" (or \"choriqueso\"), which is small pieces of chorizo served in or on melted cheese, and eaten with small corn tortillas. In heavily Mexican parts of the United States, a popular filling for breakfast tacos is \"chorizo con papas\", or diced potatoes sautéed until soft with chorizo mixed in.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, chorizo and longaniza are considered two separate meats. Puerto Rican chorizo is a smoked, well-seasoned sausage nearly identical to the smoked versions in Spain. Puerto Rican and Dominican longanizas have a very different taste and appearance. Seasoned meat is stuffed into pork casing and is formed very long by hand. It is then hung to air-dry. Longaniza can then be fried in oil or cooked with rice or beans. It is eaten with many different dishes.\n\nChorizo is a popular pizza topping in Puerto Rico.\n\nSalvadorean chorizo are short, fresh (not dried) and tied in twins.\n\nIn Ecuador, many types of sausage have been directly adopted from European or North American cuisine. All sorts of salami, either raw or smoked, are just known as salami. Most commonly known are sorts from Spanish chorizo, Italian pepperoni, and wiener sausages; wieners are the most popular. Some local specialities include \"morcilla\", \"longaniza\", and \"chorizo\". \"Morcilla\", as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically cooked pork blood encased in pork intestine casing (black pudding in English). Longaniza is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. Chorizo is a mixture of chopped pork meat, pork fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, \"achiote\", and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color. A traditional dish consists of fried egg, mashed potatoes, avocado, salad, and slices of fried chorizo.\n\nIn Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, chorizo is the name for any coarse meat sausage. Spanish-style chorizo is also available, and is distinguished by the name \"chorizo español\" (Spanish chorizo). Argentine chorizos are normally made of pork, and are not spicy hot. Some Argentine chorizos include other types of meat, typically beef. In Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Peru, a fresh chorizo, cooked and served in a bread roll, is called a \"choripán\". In Colombia, chorizo is usually accompanied by \"arepa\".\n\nIn Brazil, \"chouriço\" is the word used for what in the rest of Latin America is \"morcilla\"; meat sausages similar to the chorizos of other Latin American countries are called \"linguiça\". Many varieties of Portuguese-style chouriço and linguiça are used in many different types of dishes, such as \"feijoada\".\n\nIn Bolivia, chorizos are made of pork, fried and served with salad (tomato, lettuce, onion, boiled carrots and \"quirquiña\"), \"mote\", and a slice of bread soaked with chorizo fat. Chorizo sandwiches, without \"mote\", are also eaten.\n\nChouriço is also made in East Timor, which is a former Portuguese colony.\n\nIn Goa, India, which was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years and has a large percentage of Goan Catholics, chouriço is made from pork marinaded in a mixture of vinegar, red chilies, and spices such as garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon, which is stuffed into casings. These are enjoyed either with the local Goan Portuguese-style crusty bread, or pearl onions, or both. They are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in a rice pilaf. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying.\n\nThree kinds of chouriço are found in Goa: dry, wet, and skin. Dry chouriço is aged in the sun for long periods (three months or more). Wet chouriço has been aged for about a month or less. Skin chouriço, also aged, is rare and difficult to find. It consists primarily of minced pork skin along with some of its subcutaneous fat. All three chouriços are made in variations such as hot, medium, and mild. Other variations exist, depending on the size of the links, which range from 1 in (smallest) to 6 in. Typically, the wet varieties tend to be longer than the dry ones.\n\nGoan chourico should be distinguished from \"Goan frankfurters\", which look similar to equivalents in the United States, but with a predominantly peppercorn flavor.\n\n\"Longaniza\" (; Visayan: \"chorizo\", \"choriso\", \"soriso\") are Philippine chorizos flavored with indigenous spices, and may be made of chicken, beef, or even tuna. While the term \"longaniza\" refers to fresh sausages, it is also used in the Philippines to refer to cured sausages. Philippine \"longganisa\" are often dyed red with achuete seeds. There are dozens of variants from various regions in the Philippines.\n\nCreole and Cajun cuisine both feature a variant of chorizo called chaurice, which is frequently used in the Creole dish of red beans and rice.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "336650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336650", "title": "Sept", "text": "Sept\n\nA sept is an English word for a division of a family, especially of a Scottish or Irish family. The word may derive from the Latin \"saeptum\", meaning \"enclosure\" or \"fold\", or via an alteration of \"sect\". The term is used in both Ireland and Scotland, where it may be translated as \"sliocht\", meaning \"progeny\" or \"seed\", which may indicate the descendants of a person (for example, \"Sliocht Brian Mac Diarmada\", \"the descendant of Brian MacDermott\").\n\n\"Síol\" is a Gaelic word meaning \"progeny\" or \"seed\" that is used in the context of a family or clan with members who bear the same surname and inhabited the same territory, as a manner of distinguishing one group from another; a family called \"Mac an Bháird\" (anglicised as \"Ward\") might be divided into septs such as \"Síol Seán Mac Briain\", \"Síol Conchobhair Óg\", \"Síol Sean Cuinn\", or \"Síol Cú Chonnacht\". Each of these individual septs may further subdivide into more septs, which may sometimes lead to the development of novel surnames and/or the rise of the family such that it may be considered a clan in its own right. Such septs were common in Scotland, where the clan system was well-developed.\n\nIn the context of Scottish clans, septs are families that followed another family's chief, or part of the extended family and that hold a different surname. These smaller septs would then be part of the chief's larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage, or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. Bonds of manrent were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the \"Oxford Companion to Scottish History\", the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have seen themselves as distinct within their own lands, but would have also seen themselves as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside Lochaber. Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship.\n\nToday, sept lists are used by clan societies to recruit new members. Such lists date back to the 19th century, when clan societies and tartan manufacturers attempted to capitalise on the enthusiasm and interest for all things Scottish. Lists were drawn up that linked as many surnames as possible to a particular clan. In this way, individuals without a \"clan name\" could connect to a Scottish clan and thus feel \"entitled\" to its tartan.\n\nAlso, common surnames, found throughout the British Isles, were linked to particular clans. For example, the surname \"Millar\" / \"Miller\" was made a sept of Clan Macfarlane, and \"Taylor\" of Clan Cameron. Furthermore, patronymic forms of common personal names were also linked to particular clans. This has led to the false impression that many surnames have one origin and are all related to one another, and that such surnames are historically connected to one particular clan.\n\nHistorically, the term \"sept\" was not used in Ireland until the 19th century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated. The English word \"sept\" is most accurate in referring to a subgroup within a large clan, particularly when that group has taken up residence outside their clan's original territory (e.g. the O'Neills, MacSweeneys, and O'Connors).\n\nRelated Irish clans often belong to larger groups, dynasties, such as the Dál gCais, Uí Néill, Uí Fiachrach, and Uí Maine.\n\nRecently, Edward MacLysaght suggested the English word \"sept\" be used in place of the word 'clan' with regard to the historical social structure in Ireland, to differentiate it from the centralised Scottish clan system. This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate. Brehon Law, the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, with its electoral system limited to the senior sept's members (see derbfine), which collapsed after the Tudor Conquest in the 16th century. The Irish, when speaking of themselves, employed their term \"clan\", which means \"children\" in Irish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "336806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336806", "title": "Orthodontics", "text": "Orthodontics\n\n\"Orthodontics\" is derived from the Greek \"orthos\" (\"correct\", \"straight\") and \"-odont\" (\"tooth\").\n\nThe history of orthodontics has been intimately linked with the history of dentistry for more than 2,000 years. Dentistry had its origins as a part of medicine. According to the American Association of Orthodontists, archaeologists have discovered mummified ancients with metal bands wrapped around individual teeth.\nMalocclusion is not a disease, but abnormal alignment of the teeth and the way the upper and lower teeth fit together. The prevalence of malocclusion varies, but using orthodontic treatment indices, which categorize malocclusions in terms of severity, it can be said that nearly 30% of the population present with malocclusions severe enough to benefit from orthodontic treatment.\n\nOrthodontic treatment can focus on dental displacement only, or deal with the control and modification of facial growth. In the latter case it is better defined as \"dentofacial orthopedics\". In severe malocclusions that can be a part of craniofacial abnormality, management often requires a combination of orthodontics with headgear or reverse pull facemask and / or jaw surgery or orthognathic surgery.\n\nThis often requires additional training, in addition to the formal three-year specialty training. For instance, in the United States, orthodontists get at least another year of training in a form of fellowship, the so-called 'Craniofacial Orthodontics', to receive additional training in the orthodontic management of craniofacial anomalies.\n\nTypically treatment for malocclusion can take 1 to 2 years to complete, with braces being altered slightly every 4 to 8 weeks by the orthodontist. There are multiple methods for adjusting malocclusion, depending on the needs of the individual patient. In growing patients there are more options for treating skeletal discrepancies, either promoting or restricting growth using functional appliances, orthodontic headgear or a reverse pull facemask.\nMost orthodontic work is started during the early permanent dentition stage before skeletal growth is completed. If skeletal growth has completed, orthognathic surgery can be an option. Extraction of teeth may be required to aid the orthodontic treatment. Starting the treatment process for overjets and prominent upper teeth in children rather than waiting until the child has reached adolescence has been shown to reduce damage to the lateral and central incisors. However the treatment outcome does not differ.\n\nCurrently, the majority of Orthodontic Appliance Therapy is delivered using fixed appliances, with the use of removable appliances being greatly reduced. The treatment outcome for fixed appliances is significantly greater than that of removable appliances as the fixed type produces biomechanics that has greater control of the teeth under treatment: being able to move the teeth in dimensions therefore the subsequent final tooth positions are more ideal. \n\nIndications for Fixed Appliances\n\nFixed appliances are generally used when orthodontic treatment involves moving teeth through 3 axis planes in the mouth. These movements would include:\n\n1) Rotations where the teeth are not conforming to the arch shape and there are contact displacements.\n\n2) Multiple tooth movements where there may be crowding involved and the correction would involve the movement of numerous teeth in differing planes.\n\n3) Bodily movement may be required to move a map-aligned tooth into the arch where the broad long axis of the tooth are correct but the tooth requires moving back into the arch maintaining the axial positions.\n\n4) Tipping or changing the incline of the long axis of the tooth where the tooth may be proclined or retroclined and the tooth angulation is altered.\n\n5) Root torquing - where the angle of the long axis of the tooth is changed with the position of the root being altered to facilitate a more naturally positioned crown and root prominence.\n\nContra-indications\n\n- Poor oral hygiene: this predisposes to decalcification, caries, gingival hyperplasia, periodontal breakdown\n\n- Active caries\n\n- Poor motivation: treatment will last at least several months, patient needs to be committed to maintaining the highest levels of oral hygiene throughout this period.\n\n- Mild malocclusions\n\nRisks\n\nPlaque accumulation around the margins of brackets and bands can result in areas of demineralisation of enamel. It is very important that the patient maintains an excellent standard of oral hygiene throughout treatment.\n\nThis frequently occurs in orthodontic treatment, although it is usually small in amount. It is an irreversible outcome which is difficult to predict. Fixed appliances cause significantly more root resorption than removable appliances. Resorption occurs more frequently in adults and with greater amounts of tooth movement. Root resorption stops as soon as tooth movement stops so early detection is important.\n\n\nTypes of Fixed Appliances\n\nThere are numerous fixed appliance systems that are in use today. These vary depending on the mechanical system employed and personal preference. In basic terms, a bracket is bonded onto the center of the tooth and wires are placed in the bracket slot in order to control movement in all 3 dimensions. Each individual bracket has a different shape, function and built in features for each particular tooth. Chair-side fitted appliances include Edgewise, Begg, Lingual, Self-ligating bracket systems. Laboratory fabricated appliances include Herbst, Quadhelix and MIA, Lingual and Transpalatal arches and RME screw appliances. The most commonly used appliance today is the Pre-adjusted Edgewise Appliance.\n\nBrackets\n\nThe main parts of a bracket are: \n\nBrackets can be made from stainless steel or porcelain. Brackets can be luted onto teeth using either a direct or indirect technique. Direct techniques involve conventional acid etch and chemical or light cured composites. The indirect technique involves the appliance's brackets being light cured to a working orthodontic model to allow a thin soft splint blow down appliance to be constructed over the model to aid placement of the brackets onto the teeth.\n\nOrthodontic Bands\n\nUsed most frequently on either molar or occasionally premolar teeth. They are the means through which a force is applied to the tooth. They are made from stainless steel and have one or more tubes running through them. The large round tube is for a facebow and the smaller square tube is for the archwire. They can also have a number of pre-adjusted features built into their design, which will influence the position of teeth.\n\nArchwires\n\nArchwires are made from differing metal alloys, and are supplied as either straight lengths or as pre-formed archwires. There are different types of archwires including: \nArchwires are carefully fitted into each bracket slot ready for ligation. Ligating is done using either elastic modules or thin wire ligatures: 'Quick Ties'. The closer the fit of the arch wires in the slot on the bracket, the greater the control of the teeth. As treatment progresses, thicker wires are used to fully control the teeth in three dimensions.\n\nAuxiliaries \n\nWhen there is a maxillary overjet, or Class II occlusion, functional appliances can be used to correct the occlusion, it is recommended that the professional be a specialist in orofacial orthopaedics to perform this type of appliance. The most common fixed appliance being used today is the Pre-adjusted Edgewise Appliance. treatment, the originator of orthodontic therapy involving the use of oral activators by orofacial orthopaedics was Viggo Andresen, Viggo Valdemar Julius Andresen (Copenhagen, May 31, 1870 - October 8, 1950 ) was a Danish professor in Orthodontics in Oslo who is considered to be the inventor of the activator . In 1908 Viggo Andresen applied his bracket for the first time. Andresen used the activator to stimulate the development of the lower jaw and the lower teeth in growing children orthodontically. These may be fixed or removable.\nFixed dental braces are wires that are inserted into brackets secured to the teeth on the labial or lingual surface (lingual braces) of teeth. Other classes of functional appliances include removable appliances and over the head appliances, and these functional appliances are used to redirect jaw growth. Post-treatment retainers are frequently used to maintain the new position of the dentition.\nDuring fixed orthodontic treatment, metal wires are held in place by elastic bands on orthodontic brackets (braces) on each tooth and inserted into bands around the molars. The orthodontic archwires can be made from stainless steel, nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) or a more aesthetic ceramic material. Ni-Ti is used as the initial arch wire as it has good flexibility, allowing it to exert the same forces regardless of how much it has been deflected. There is also heat activated Ni-Ti wire which tightens when it is heated to body temperature. The arch wires interact with the brackets to move teeth into the desired positions.\n\nFixed orthodontic appliances aid tooth movement, and are used when a 3-D movement of the tooth is required in the mouth and multiple tooth movement is necessary. Ceramic fixed appliances can be used which more closely mimic the tooth colour than the metal brackets. Some manufacturers offer self-litigating fixed appliances where the metal wires are held by an integral clip on the bracket themselves. These can be supplied as either metal or ceramic.\n\nThe surfaces of the teeth are etched, and brackets are attached to the teeth with an adhesive that is durable enough to withstand the orthodontic forces but is able to be removed at the end of treatment without damaging the tooth. Currently, there is not enough evidence to determine whether self-etch preparations or conventional etchants cause less decalcification around the bonding site and if there is a difference between them in bond failure rate. The bonding material must also adhere to the surface of the tooth, be easy to use and preferably protect the tooth surface against caries (decay) as the orthodontic appliance becomes a trap for the plaque. Currently, a resin/matrix adhesive which is command light cured is most commonly used. This is similar to composite filling material.\n\nAnchorage for the appliance prevents unwanted movement of teeth and it can come from the headgear worn, the palate, or surgical implants.\n\nFor young patients with mild to moderate Angle Class III malocclusions (prognathism), a functional appliance is sufficient for correction. Examples of functional appliances are: facemask, chin-cup, tandem traction bow or headgear. As the malocclusion increases, orthognathic surgery might be required. This treatment comes in three stages. Prior to surgery, there is orthodontic treatment to align teeth into their post-surgery occlusion positions. The second stage is surgery such as a mandibular step osteotomy or sagittal/bilateral sagittal split osteotomy depending on whether one or both sides of the mandible are affected. The bone is broken during surgery and is stabilised with titanium plates and screws, or bioresorbable plates to allow for healing to take place. The third stage of treatment is the post-surgical orthodontic treatment to move the teeth into their final positions to ensure the best possible occlusion.\n\nA posterior crossbite malocclusion may be corrected using the quad helix appliance or removable appliances during the early mixed dentition stage (eight to 10 years), and more research is required for determining whether any intervention provides greater results than any other for later stages of dentition development.\nThese crossbites are when the maxillary teeth or jaw is narrower than the mandibular and can occur unilaterally or bilaterally. \n. Treatment involves the expansion of the maxillary arch to restore functional occlusion, which can either be 'fast' at 0.5mm per day or 'slow' at 0.5mm per week. Palatal expansion can be achieved using either fixed or removable appliances. Banded maxillary expansion involves metal bands bonded to individual teeth which are attached to braces, and bonded maxillary expansion is an acrylic splint with a wire framework attached to a screw in the palatal mid-line, which can be turned and opened to expand the maxilla.\n\nRemovable functional appliances are useful for simple movements and can aid in altering the angulation of a tooth: retroclining maxillary teeth and proclining mandibular teeth; help with expansion, and overbite reduction.\n\nHeadgear works by applying forces externally to the back of the head, moving the molar teeth posteriorly (distalising) to allow space for the anterior teeth and relieving the overcrowding or to help with anchorage problems. \n\nThe facemask aims to pull maxillary teeth and jaw forward and downwards to meet the mandible through a balanced force applied to the upper teeth. The mask rests on the forehead and chin of the wearer and connects to the maxillary teeth with elastic bands.\n\nSome removable appliances have a flat acrylic bite plane to allow full disocclusion between the maxillary and mandibular teeth to aid in movement during treatment. An example of this is the Clark Twin Block. This design has two blocks of acrylic which disocclude the teeth and protrude the mandible. It is used to treat Class II malocclusion.\n\nVacuum-formed aligners such as Invisalign consist of clear, flexible, plastic trays that move teeth incrementally to reduce mild overcrowding and can improve mild irregularities and spacing. They are not suitable for use in complex orthodontic cases and cannot produce body movement. They are worn full-time by the patient apart from when eating and drinking. A large benefit of these types of orthodontic appliance are that they suitable for use when the patient has porcelain veneers: as metal brackets cannot be bonded to the veneer surface.\n\nAdjunctive surgical and non-surgical therapy have been researched as options to help reduce the duration of orthodontic treatment. Surgical intervention such as alveolar decortication, and corticision have been used in conjunction with orthodontic treatment to reduce the time spent in functional appliances, but more research is required into the possible effects of the surgery. Non-surgical therapy involves the use of vibrational forces during treatment, but it has not been shown that this significantly reduces the treatment time, or increases the comfort for the patient.\n\nExtensive research has been done proving the effectiveness of functional appliances, but maintaining the results is important once the active treatment phase has completed.\n\nAfter orthodontic treatment has completed, there is a tendency for teeth to return, or relapse, back to their pre-treatment positions. Over 50% of patients have some reversion to pre-treatment positions within 10 years following treatment. To prevent relapse, the majority of patients will be offered a retainer (orthodontics) once treatment has completed, and will benefit from wearing their retainers. Retainers can be either fixed or removable. Removable retainers will be worn for different periods of time depending on patient need to stabilise the dentition. Fixed retainers are a simple wire fixed to the labial surface of the incisors using dental adhesive and can be specifically useful to prevent rotation in incisors. Other types of fixed retainers can include labial or lingual braces, with brackets fixed to the teeth.\n\nRemovable retainers can include one known as a Hawley retainer, made with an acrylic base plate and metal wire covering the canine to the canine region. Another form of a removable retainer is the Essix retainer which is made from vacuum-formed polypropylene or polyvinylchloride and can cover all the dentition.\n\nIn diagnosis and treatment planning, the orthodontist must (1) recognize the various characteristics of a malocclusion or dentofacial deformity; (2) define the nature of the problem, including the etiology if possible; (3) design a treatment strategy based on the specific needs and desires of the individual; and (4) present the treatment strategy to the patient in such a way that the patient fully understands the ramifications of his/her decision.\n\nTreatment planning is a crucial aspect of health care. In terms of orthodontics, it is important to consider the following aspects when arriving at a treatment plan for patients;\n(1) aesthetics (consider the patient's concerns and expectations from the treatment),\n(2) oral health (consider patient motivation and the overall dentition. All patients who are to undergo orthodontic treatment need to maintain good oral health),\n(3) function and\n(4) stability.\n\nOrthodontic treatment “should not compromise dental health [but] promote good function, and it should produce as stable a result as possible”.\n\nBefore a treatment plan can be devised, it is important to establish a diagnosis. An in-depth orthodontic assessment of the patient is pivotal.\n\nBased on the patient's concerns/expectations and the diagnosis made, a list of ‘problems’ can be made. Depending on the problems, it is possible that there may be more than one course of treatment for the patient. It is important to have a list of ‘problems’ where you can list treatment options for each ‘problem’ and present this information to the patient along with the benefits and risks of each treatment option.\n\nMalocclusions vary in severity and can sometimes be simple to treat or very complex to treat.\n\nThere are a few options for treating malocclusions with underlying skeletal problems;\n\n(1) Orthodontic camouflage: This means that the discrepancy is accepted, but the teeth are moved into a Class I relationship.\n\n(2) Growth Modification: This treatment is only possible in the growing patient where orthodontic appliances are used to make minor changes to the skeletal pattern.\n\n(3) Combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment: surgical correction of the jaw discrepancy in combination with orthodontics is performed to produce optimum dental and facial aesthetics. Orthognathic surgery can only be performed on patients who have completed growth.\n\nCrowding of teeth is also common amongst the population. Treatment planning for crowding involves analysing the space required to relieve the crowding.\n\nThe amount of crowding present can be classified as: mild (<4mm), moderate (4-8mm) or severe (>8mm).\n\nSpace can be created in the following ways:\n\n(1) Extractions\n\n(2) Distal movement of molars\n\n(3) Enamel stripping\n\n(4) Expansion\n\n(5) Proclination of the incisors\n\n(6) A combination of any or all of the above\n\nIt is of paramount importance to take all the teeth present and yet to erupt into account and to consider the prognosis of each tooth in order to arrive at a treatment plan.\n\nAfter a treatment plan has been devised, informed consent has to be taken from the patient. Informed consent includes giving the patient information about the malocclusion, proposed treatment/alternatives, commitment required, duration of the treatment and the cost implications.\n\nMalocclusion is defined as an abnormal deviation either aesthetically, functionally or both from the ideal occlusion; the anatomically perfect arrangement of the teeth. The prevalence of malocclusions varies with a person's age and ethnicity but not all malocclusions require treatment.\n\nMalocclusions are the result of a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. Key factors include:\nClassification of malocclusions\n\nSkeletal classifications show the relationship of the maxilla to the mandible:\n\nIncisor classification - The British's Standards Institute classification is used to define the incisal relationship:\n\nAngle's classification (Molar) is used to describe the first permanent molar relationship from normal to malocclusion:\n\nOther types of dental malocclusions can include:\n\nOverjet: the horizontal distance between the labial surface of the lower incisors and the upper incisal edge; the normal measurement is 2-3mm.\n\nOverbite: the vertical distance between the upper and lower incisal edges. Normal is one-third to two-thirds overlap of the upper incisor to the lower incisor. An incomplete overbite is when the lower incisors do not occlude with the opposing upper incisors or the palatal mucosa when the buccal segment teeth are in occlusion.\n\nCrossbite: A deviation from the normal bucco-lingual relationship. These can either be anterior or posterior but also unilateral or bilateral. Crossbites can be further broken down into\n\nAnterior open bite: there is no vertical overlap of the incisors when the buccal segment teeth are in occlusion.<br>Posterior open bite: when the teeth are in occlusion there is a space between the upper and lower posterior teeth.\n\nCrowding\n\nCrowding occurs when one or more teeth do not have enough room to align within the arch. Crowding can be caused by a wide range of factors:\n\nOrthodontic indices are one of the few tools that are available for orthodontists to grade and assess malocclusion. Orthodontic indices can be useful for an epidemiologist to analyse prevalence and severity of malocclusion in any population.\n\nAngle's Classification is devised in 1899 by father of Orthodontic, Dr Edward Angle to describe the classes of malocclusion, widely accepted and widely used since it was published. Angle's Classification is based on the relationship of the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar and the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. Angle's Classification describes 3 classes of malocclusion: \nAngle's classification only considers anteroposterior deviations in the sagittal plane while malocclusion is a three dimensional problem (sagittal, transverse and vertical) rather than two dimensional as described in Angle's classification Angle's classification also disregards the relationship of the teeth to the face.\n\nIntroduced in 1951 by Massler & Frankel to produce a way to record the prevalence of malocclusion which will satisfy 3 criteria: simple, accurate and applicable to large groups of individual; yield quantitative information that could be statistically analysed; reproducible so that results are comparable. This index uses individual teeth as unit of occlusion instead of a segment of the arch. Each tooth is examined to determine whether it is in correct occlusion or it is maloccluded.\n\nThe total number of maloccluded teeth is the counted and recorded. Each tooth is examined from two different aspects: occlusal aspect and then the buccal and labial surfaces with the exclusion of third molars. Tooth that is not in perfect occlusion from both occlusal aspect (in perfect alignment with contact line) and buccal aspect (in perfect alignment with plane of occlusion and in correct interdigitation with opposing teeth) is considered as maloccluded. Each maloccluded tooth is given a value of 1 while tooth in perfect occlusion is given a score of 0. A score of 0 will indicate a perfect occlusion; score of more than 10 would be classified as sufficient severity that would require orthodontic treatment; score between 1 and 9 would be classified as normal occlusion in which no orthodontic treatment is indicated.\n\nHowever, while this index is simple, easy and able to provide prevalence and incidence data in populations group, there are some major disadvantage with this index: primary dentition, erupting teeth and missing teeth are left out in the scoring system and difficulties in judging conformity of each tooth to an ideal position in all planes.\n\nIntroduced in 1959 by Lawrence Vankirk and Elliott Pennell. This index requires the use of a small plastic, gauge-like tool designed for assessment. Tooth rotation and displacement are measured.\n\nThe mouth is divided into 6 segments, and is examined in the following order: maxillary anterior, maxillary right posterior, maxillary left posterior, mandibular anterior, mandibular right posterior and mandibular left posterior. The tool is superimposed over the teeth for the scoring measurement, each tooth present is scored 0, 1 or 2.\n\n2 types of malalignment are being measured, rotation and displacement. Rotation is defined as the angle formed by the line projected through contact areas of observed tooth and the ideal arch line. Displacement is defined as both of the contact areas of the tooth are displaced in the same direction from the ideal alignment position.\n\nThis index was proposed in 1960 by Harry L. Draker. HLDI was designed for identification of dento-facial handicap. The index is designed to yield prevalence data if used in screenings. Measurement taken are as following: cleft palate (all or nothing), severe traumatic deviation (all or none), overjet (mm), overbite (mm), mandibular protrusion (mm), anterior open bite (mm), labiolingual spread (measurement of tooth displacement in mm) \nHLD index is used in several states in the United States, with some modifications to its original form by the states that used them for determining orthodontic treatment need.\n\nOcclusal Feature Index is introduced by Poulton and Aaronson in 1961. The index is based on four primary features of occlusion that is important in orthodontic examination. The four primary features are as following: \n\nOcclusal Feature Index recognises malocclusion is a combination of the way teeth occlude as well as the position of the teeth relative to the neighbouring teeth. However, the scoring system is not sensitive enough for case selection for orthodontic purposes.\n\nIntroduced in 1961 by Grainger. MSE measured 7 weighted and defined measurement:\n\nMSE defined and outlined 6 syndromes of malocclusion:\n\nDespite being a relative comprehensive definition, there are a few shortcomings of this index, namely: the data is derived from a 12 years old patients hence might not be valid for deciduous and mixed dentitions, the score does not reflect all the measurement that were taken and accumulated and the absence of any occlusal disorder is not scored as zero. Grainger then revised the MSE index and published the revised version in 1967 and renamed the index to Treatment Priority Index (TPI).\n\nOcclusal Index was developed by Summers in his doctoral dissertation in 1966, and the final paper was published in 1971. Based on Malocclusion Severity Estimate (MSE), OI attempted to overcome the shortcoming of the MSE.\n\nSummers devised different scoring scheme for deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition with 6 predefined stages of dental age:\n\nNine weighted and defined measurement being taken:\n\nSummers also defined 7 malocclusion syndromes which includes:\n\nGrade Index Scale for assessment of treatment need (GISATN) was created by Salonen L in 1966. GISATN grades the type and severity of the malocclusion, however, the index doesn't indicate or describe the damage each type of occlusion can cause.\n\nTreatment priority index (TPI) was created in 1967 by R.M. Grainger in Washington D.C United States. Grainger described the index as “a method of assessing the severity of the most common types of malocclusion, the degree of handicaps or their priority of treatment”. In the index there are eleven weighed and defined measurements which are: upper anterior segment overjet, lower anterior segment overjet, overbite of upper anterior over lower anterior, anterior open bite, congenital absence of incisors, distal molar relation, mesial molar relation, posterior crossbite (buccal), posterior crossbite (lingual), tooth displacement, gross anomalies. It also includes the seven maloclussion syndromes: maxillary expansion syndrome, overbite, retrognathism, open bite, prognathism, maxillary collapse syndrome and congenitally missing incisors.\n\nHandicapping malocclusion assessment record (HMAR) was created by Salzmann JA in 1968. It was created to establish needs for treatment of handicapping malocclusion according to severity presented by magnitude of the score when assessing the malocclusion. The assessment can be made either directly from the oral cavity or from available casts. To make the assessment more accurate an additional record form is made for direct mouth assessment which allows the recording and scoring of mandibular function, facial asymmetry, lower lip malposition in relation to the maxillary incisor teeth and desirability of treatment. The index has been accepted as a standard by the Council or Orthodontic Health Care, the Board of Directors of the American Association due to the easy use of HMAR.\n\nLittle irregularity index was first written about in his published paper The Irregularity Index: a quantitative score of mandibular anterior alignment. The Littles Irregularity index is generally used by public health sectors and insurance companies to determine the need for treatment and the severity of the malocclusion. It is said that the method is “simple, reliable and valid” of which to measure linear displacement of the tooths contact point. The index is used by creating five linear lines of adjacent contact points starting from mesial of right canine to mesial of left canine and this is recorded. Once this is done the model cast can be ranked on a scale ranging from 0-10.\n\nThe WHO/FDI index uses the prevalence of malocclusion ion and estimates the needs for treatment of the population by various ways. It was developed by the Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) Commission on Classification and Statistics for Oral Conditions (COCSTOC). The aim when creating the index was to allow for a system in measuring occlusion which can be easily comparable. \nThe five major groups which are recorded are as follows:\n1.Gross Anomalies\n2.Dentition: absent teeth, supernumerary teeth, malformed incisors and exotic eruption\n3.Spaced condition: Diastema, Crowding and Spacing\n4.Occlusion: \n5. Orthodontic treatment need judged subjectively : non necessary, doubtful and necessary \n\nThe aesthetic index created in 1986 by Cons NC and Jenny J and has been recognised by WHO by which it was added into the International Collaboration Study of Oral health Outcomes. The index links the aesthetic aspect and the clinical need plus the patients' perception and combines them mathematically to produce a single score. Even though DAI is widely recognised in the US, in Europe due to government pressures more effort was spent on defining patients with malocclusions which can be damaging and which can qualify under the government regulations to be paid for rather than looking at the aesthetic aspect.\n\nHLD was a suggestion by Dr. Harry L. Draker in 1960 in the published American Journal of Orthodontics in 1960. It was meant to identify the most unfavourable looking malocclusion as handicapping however it completely failed to recognise patients with a large maxillary protrusion with fairly even teeth, which would be seen extremely handicapped by the public. The index finally became a law driven modification of the 1960 suggestion by Dr. Harry L. Draker and became the HLD (CalMod) Index of California. In 1994, California was sued once again and the settlement from this allowed for adjustments to be made. This allowed overjets greater than 9mm to qualify as an exception, correcting the failure of the previous modification. To settle the suit and respond to plaintiff's wishes a reverse overate greater than 3.5mm was also included into the qualifying exception. The modification later went into official use in 1991.\n\nThe intent of the HLD (CalMod) index is measuring the presence or absence, and the degree of the handicap caused by components of the index and not to diagnose malocclusion. \nThe measurements for the index are made with a Boley Gauge (or a disposable ruler) scaled in millimetres.\nAbsence of a condition must be presented by entering ‘0’.\n\nThese are the various conditions you have to take into consideration:\n\nOnce this is completed and all the checks are done, the scores are added up. If the patient does not score 26 or above they may still be eligible under the EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment) exception, if medical necessity is documented.\n\nThis index was implemented in 1987 by the British Orthodontic Standard Working Party after 10 members of this party formulated this index over a series of 6 meetings\n\nThis index is a fast, simple and robust way of assessing the standard of orthodontic treatment that an individual orthodontist is achieving or trying to achieve rather than the degree of malocclusion and/or need for orthodontic treatment. However, it should have already been concluded that these patients should be receiving orthodontic treatment prior to the PAR index. The PAR index has also been used to assess whether clinicians are correctly determining the need for orthodontic treatment when compared with a calibrated examiner of malocclusion.\n\nThis type of index compares outcomes of orthodontic treatment as it primarily observes the results of a group of patients, rather than on an individual basis against results that they would expect. This type of testing occurs as there will always be a small number of individual patients in which the index results do not fully represent. The interpretation of the results shows that when there is a PAR score of more than 70% it represents a very high standard of treatment, anything less than 50% shows an overall poor standard of treatment and below 30% means that the patients malocclusion has not been improved by orthodontic treatment\n\nThe results should only be compared using a group of patients rather than individual bases as this could show completely different results which wouldn't be representative of the standard of treatment being carried out\n\nThe Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need was developed and tested in 1989 by Brook and Shaw in England following a government initiative.\n\nThe aim of the IOTN is to assess the probable impact a malocclusion may have on an individual's dental health and psychosocial wellbeing. The index easily identifies the individuals who will benefit most from orthodontic treatment and assigns them a treatment priority. Hence, in the UK, it is used to determine whether a patient under the age of 18 years is eligible for orthodontic treatment on the NHS.\n\nIt comprises two elements: the dental health component and an aesthetic component.\n\nFor the dental health component (DHC), malocclusion is categorised into 5 grades based on occlusal characteristics that could affect the function and longevity of the dentition. The index is not cumulative; the single worst feature of a malocclusion determines the grade assigned. \n\nThe aesthetic component (AC) takes into consideration the potential psychosocial impact of a malocclusion. A scale of 10 standardised colour photographs showing decreasing levels of dental attractiveness is used. The pictures are compared to the patient's teeth, when viewed in occlusion from the anterior aspect, by an orthodontist who will score accordingly. The scores are categorised according to treatment need:\nThe AC has been criticised due to its subjective nature and for the lack of representation of Class III malocclusions and anterior open bites in the photographs used.\n\nOften, the DHC score alone is used to determine treatment need. However, the AC is often used in borderline cases (DHC grade 3). The IOTN is used in the following manner:\n\nThis index was implemented in 1990 by Danish national board of health.\n\nIn 1990 a Danish system was introduced based on health risks related to malocclusion, where it describes possible damages and problems arising from untreated malocclusion which allows for the identification of treatment need.\n\nThis mandate introduced a descriptive index that is more valid from a biological view, using qualitative analysis instead of a quantitative.\n\nThe ITRI was established in 1992 by Haeger which utilises both intra-arch and inter-arch relationships to generate index scores to compare the entire dentitions occlusion. This index is of use as it divides the arches into segments which would result in a more accurate outcome.\n\nThis index evaluates tooth relationships from a morphological perspective which has been of use when evaluating the results of orthodontic treatment, post-treatment stability, settling, relapse and different orthodontic treatment modalities.\n\nThe ITRI can allow for comparisons to be made in an objective and quantitative manner that allows for statistical analysis of orthodontic outcomes.\n\nThis index was first described and implemented in 1992 by Espeland LV \"et al\" and is also known as the Norwegian Orthodontic Treatment Index.\n\nThis index is used by the Norwegian health insurance system and due to this it is designed for allocation of public subsidies of treatment expenses, and the amount of reimbursement which is related to the category of treatment need. It classifies malocclusions into four categories based on the necessity of the treatment need.\n\nThis is a tool used to assess treatment need in young patients by evaluating malocclusion problems in growing children, assuming that some aspects may change under positive or negative effects of craniofacial development. It was published for use in 1998 by Russo \"et al\".\n\nThis index illustrates the need for orthodontic intervention and is used to establish a relationship between the registered onset of orthodontic treatment and disorders inhibiting growth of facial and alveolar bones, and the development of the dentition along with the IOTN index.\n\nThis index can be used in exchange for the IOTN scale as it is quick and easy to apply as a screening test to decide whether and when to refer patients to specialist orthodontists.\n\nThis index was produced in 2000 by Charles Daniels and Stephen Richmond in Cardiff and has been investigated to illustrate that it can be used to replace the PAR and IOTN scale as a means of determining need and outcome of orthodontic treatment.\n\nThis index measures the following to produce a scoring system:\nThe measurements are added together to produce a score which can be interpreted by score ranges that give need for treatment, complexity and degree of improvement.\n\nThis system claims to be more efficient than the PAR and IOTN indices as it only requires a single measurement protocol but this has still to be validated to be used in the UK and the issue that It does not suitably predict appearance, function, speech or treatment need for individuals attending general dental practice for routine dental treatment, so for these reasons is it generally never used.\n\nThis was established in 2014 by Grippaudo \"et al\" for use in assessing the risks/benefits of early orthodontic therapies in the primary dentition.\n\nIt is a paediatric type version of the ROMA scale. It measures occlusal parameters, skeletal and functional factors that may represent negative risks for a physiological development of the orofacial region, and indicates the need for preventative or interceptions orthodontic treatment using a score scale.\n\nThis index was designed as it has been observed that some of the malocclusion signs observed in the primary dentition can deteriorate with growth while others remain the same over time and others can even improve. This index is therefore used to classify the malocclusions observed at an early stage on a risk-based scale.\n\nAssessment of the aesthetics is mostly subjective and any orthodontic index which has an aesthetic component can reduce the objectivity of the index in determining the need for treatment and theoretically not suitable for assessing orthodontic treatment need in a research setting or resource allocation.\n\nThere are several speciality areas in dentistry, but the speciality of orthodontics was the first to be recognized within dentistry. Specifically, the American Dental Association recognized orthodontics as a speciality in the 1950s. Each country has their own system for training and registering orthodontic specialists.\n\nIn Canada, obtaining a dental degree, such as a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Medical Dentistry (DMD), would be required before being accepted by a school for orthodontic training. Currently, there are 10 schools in the country offering the orthodontic specialty. Candidates should contact the individual school directly to obtain the most recent pre-requisites before entry. The Canadian Dental Association expects orthodontists to complete at least two years of post-doctoral, specialty training in orthodontics in an accredited program, after graduating from their dental degree.\n\nSimilar to Canada, there are several colleges and universities in the United States that offer orthodontic programs. Every school has a different enrollment process, but every applicant is required to have graduated with a DDS or DMD from an accredited dental school. Entrance into an accredited orthodontics program is extremely competitive, and begins by passing a national or state licensing exam.\n\nThe program generally lasts for two to three years, and by the final year, graduates are to complete the written American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) exam. This exam is also broken down into two components: a written exam and a clinical exam. The written exam is a comprehensive exam that tests for the applicant's knowledge of basic sciences and clinical concepts. The clinical exam, however, consists of a Board Case Oral Examination (BCOE), a Case Report Examination (CRE), and a Case Report Oral Examination (CROE). Once certified, certification must then be renewed every ten years. Orthodontic programs can award the Master of Science degree, Doctor of Science degree, or Doctor of Philosophy degree depending on the school and individual research requirements.\n\nDhaka Dental College in Bangladesh is one of the many schools recognized by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM&DC) that offer post-graduation orthodontic courses. Before applying to any post-graduation training courses, an applicant must have completed the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) examination from any dental college. After application, the applicant must take an admissions test held by the specific college. When successful, selected candidates undergo training for six months.\n\nThroughout the United Kingdom, there are several Orthodontic Specialty Training Registrar posts available. The program is full-time for three years, and upon completion, trainees graduate with a degree at the Masters or Doctorate level. Training may take place within hospital departments that are linked to recognized dental schools. Obtaining a Certificate of Completion of Specialty Training (CCST) allows an orthodontic specialist to be registered under the General Dental Council (GDC). An orthodontic specialist can provide care within a primary care setting, but to work at a hospital as an orthodontic consultant, higher level training is further required as a post-CCST trainee. To work within a university setting, as an academic consultant, completing research toward obtaining a PhD is also required.\n\nIn Pakistan to be enrolled as a student or resident in postgraduation orthodontic course approved by Pakistan medical and dental council, the dentist must graduate with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) or equivalent degree. Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PMDC) has a recognized program in orthodontics as Master in Dental Surgery (MDS) orthodontics and FCPS orthodontics as 4 years post graduate degree programs, latter of which is conducted by CPSP Pakistan.\n\nGood oral hygiene is essential for successful orthodontic treatment. The presence of orthodontic appliances placed on the teeth makes traditional oral home care techniques very challenging to perform. It is important that a good oral hygiene regime is established at the beginning of treatment and adhered to. A lapse in this may lead to a common complication of orthodontic treatment - tooth decay and periodontal disease.\n\nThe earliest sign of tooth decay that can be detected with the naked eye is the presence of white spot lesions. These can occur as early as 4 weeks after treatment with an appliance commences. It is therefore important to ensure that all surfaces of the tooth's crown are reached to ensure effective plaque removal. The places with the highest level of plaque accumulation for someone with an orthodontic appliance is around the maxillary lateral incisors and canines, gingival margin and appliance brackets. Regular toothbrushes may struggle to reach all these places, therefore, providing inadequate cleaning. A toothbrush that is regularly replaced, Interdental brushes and floss are helpful in achieving this.\n\nOrthodontists recommend that those currently undergoing orthodontic treatment brush twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste – one containing 2,800ppm of NaF is indicated for those with orthodontic appliances. It is also recommended that patients also use fluoride mouth rinse at a separate time to brushing.\n\nDiet is also an important part of establishing a good oral health regimen. Avoiding crunchy and sticky foods will not only reduce the level of food deposits around the appliance but also protect the delicate wires and brackets against breakage and separation. Reducing the level of sugar in the diet also decreases the risk of caries, that can lead to demineralisation around the appliance. Limiting high sugar food and drink to meal times is an effective way of doing this. In between meals snacking on healthy foods such as wholemeal bread, dry crackers, bread sticks vegetables sticks and cheese. These are all safe food and will help to reduce the risk of forming caries. Be aware eating hard or chewy foods such as apples and carrots can lead to wire breakages, cut these foods up first or avoid them completely for the duration of treatment.\n\nWhen wearing a removable appliance, a high quality of care is equally important. After each meal, the appliance should be removed, and the teeth cleaned as normal. The toothbrush and paste should then be used to gently brush away any food or plaque deposits from the appliance, over a bowl of water to prevent breakage if dropped. It is ideal for patients to carry a toothbrush with them during treatment to allow this level of cleaning to take place while at school or work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "337743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337743", "title": "Sacred Harp", "text": "Sacred Harp\n\nSacred Harp singing is a tradition of sacred choral music that originated in New England and was later perpetuated and carried on in the American South of the United States. The name is derived from \"The Sacred Harp,\" a ubiquitous and historically important tunebook printed in shape notes. The work was first published in 1844 and has reappeared in multiple editions ever since. Sacred Harp music represents one branch of an older tradition of American music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in New England, with a significant, related development under the influence of \"revival\" services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the shape note style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nSacred Harp music is performed \"a cappella\" (voice only, without instruments) and originated as Protestant Christian music.\n\nThe name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape-note book from which the music is sung, \"The Sacred Harp\". This book exists today in various editions, discussed below.\n\nIn shape-note music, notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader identify them on the musical scale. There are two prevalent systems, one using four shapes, and one using seven. In the four-shape system used in \"The Sacred Harp\", each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable, \"fa\", \"sol\", \"la\", or \"mi\", and these syllables are employed in singing the notes, just as in the more familiar system that uses \"do\", \"re\", \"mi\", etc. (see solfege). The four-shape system is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable-shape combination other than \"mi\" is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale. For example, the C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:\n\nThe shape for \"fa\" is a triangle, \"sol\" an oval, \"la\" a rectangle, and \"mi\" a diamond.\n\nIn Sacred Harp singing, pitch is not absolute. The shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale, not particular pitches. Thus for a song in the key of C, \"fa\" designates C and F; for a song in G, \"fa\" designates G and C, and so on; hence it is called a \"moveable \"do\"\" system.\n\nWhen Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help with the task of sight reading. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words.\n\nSacred Harp groups always sing a cappella, that is to say, without accompanying instruments. The singers arrange themselves in a hollow square, with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts: treble, alto, tenor, and bass. The treble and tenor sections are usually mixed, with men and women singing the notes an octave apart.\n\nThere is no single leader or conductor; rather, the participants take turns in leading. The leader for a particular round selects a song from the book, and \"calls\" it by its page number. Leading is done in an open-palm style, standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors (see: \"Leading Sacred Harp music\").\n\nThe pitch at which the music is sung is relative; there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point. The leader, or else some particular singer assigned to the task, finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group (see: \"Pitching Sacred Harp music\"). The singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts, and then the song begins immediately.\n\nThe music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book, but with certain deviations established by custom; see Performance practice of Sacred Harp music.\n\nAs the name implies, Sacred Harp music is sacred music and originated as Protestant Christian music. Many of the songs in the book are hymns that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant hymnody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from \"mainstream\" Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as fuguing tunes, contain sections that are polyphonic in texture, and the harmony tends to deemphasize the interval of the third in favor of fourths and fifths. In their melodies, the songs often use the pentatonic scale or similar \"gapped\" (fewer than seven-note) scales.\n\nIn their musical form, Sacred Harp songs fall into three basic types. Many are ordinary \"hymn tunes\", mostly composed in four-bar phrases and sung in multiple verses. \"Fuging tunes\" contain a prominent passage about 1/3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession, in a way resembling a fugue. \"Anthems\" are longer songs, less regular in form, that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses.\n\nSacred Harp singing normally occurs not in church services, but in special gatherings or \"singings\" arranged for the purpose. Singings can be local, regional, statewide, or national. Small singings are often held in homes, with perhaps only a dozen singers. Large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants. The more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day, traditionally called \"dinner on the grounds.\"\n\nSome of the largest and oldest annual singings are called \"conventions\". The oldest Sacred Harp convention was the Southern Musical Convention, organized in Upson County, Georgia in 1845. The two oldest surviving Sacred Harp singing conventions are the Chattahoochee Musical Convention (organized in Coweta County, Georgia in 1852), and the East Texas Sacred Harp Convention (organized as the East Texas Musical Convention in 1855).\n\nSacred Harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one, not a passive one. Those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other, and not for an audience. This can be seen in several aspects of the tradition.\n\nFirst, the seating arrangement (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly intended for the singers, not for external listeners. Non-singers are always welcome to attend a singing, but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section, rather than in a designated separate audience location.\n\nThe leader, being equidistant from all sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the benefits of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song.\n\nThe music itself is also meant to be participatory. Most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top (treble) line, where it can be best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task. For this reason, \"bringing out the melody\" is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuging tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part.\n\nMarini (2003) traces the earliest roots of Sacred Harp to the \"country parish music\" of early 18th century England. This form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition, until they ultimately became part of Sacred Harp singing. These traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors, harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifth, and the distinction between the ordinary four-part hymn (\"plain tune\"), the anthem, and the fuging tune. Several composers of this school, including Joseph Stephenson and Aaron Williams, are represented in the 1991 Edition of \"The Sacred Harp\". For further information on the English roots of Sacred Harp music, see \"West gallery music\".\n\nAround the mid 18th century, the forms and styles of English country parish music were introduced to America, notably in a new tunebook called \"Urania\", published 1764 by the singing master James Lyon. This stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition, signaled by the 1770 publication of William Billings's \"The New England Psalm Singer\", and then by a great number of new compositions by Billings and those who followed in his path. The work of these composers, sometimes called the \"First New England School\", forms a major part of the Sacred Harp to this day.\n\nBillings and his followers worked as singing masters, who led singing schools. The purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music. This pedagogical movement flourished, and led ultimately to the invention of shape notes, which originated as way to making the teaching of singing easier. The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801: \"The Easy Instructor\" by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little's shapes competed with a rival system, created by Andrew Law (1749–1821) in his \"The Musical Primer\" of 1803. Although this book came out two years later than Smith and Little's book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes. In his system, a square indicated \"fa\", a circle \"sol\", a triangle \"la\" and a diamond, \"mi.\" Law used the shaped notes without a musical staff. The Smith and Little shapes ultimately prevailed.\n\nShape notes became very popular, and during the first part of the nineteenth century, a whole series of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the population spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of folk song for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape note book prior to \"The Sacred Harp\" was William Walker's \"Southern Harmony\", published in 1835 and still in use today.\n\nEven as they flourished and spread, shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack. The critics were from the urban-based \"better music\" movement, spearheaded by Lowell Mason, which advocated a more \"scientific\" style of sacred music, more closely based on the harmonic styles of contemporaneous European music. The new style gradually prevailed. Shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the Civil War, and from the rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest in the following decades. However, they retained a haven in the rural South, which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote publications.\n\nSacred Harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King's \"The Sacred Harp\". It was this book, now distributed in several different versions, that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants.\n\nB. F. White (1800-1879) was originally from Union County, South Carolina, but since 1842 had been living in Harris County, Georgia. He prepared \"The Sacred Harp\" in collaboration with a younger man, E. J. King, (ca. 1821–44), who was from Talbot County, Georgia. Together they compiled, transcribed, and composed tunes, and published a book of over 250 songs.\n\nKing died soon after the book was published, and White was left to guide its growth. He was responsible for organizing singing schools and conventions at which \"The Sacred Harp\" was used as the songbook. During his lifetime, the book became popular and would go through three revisions (1850, 1859, and 1869), all produced by committees consisting of White and several colleagues working under the auspices of the Southern Musical Convention. The first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book. The 1869 revision was more extensive, removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places. From the original 262 pages, the book was expanded by 1869 to 477. This edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Sacred Harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism. The conflict ultimately split the community.\n\nB. F. White had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book; thus the version that Sacred Harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old. During this time, the musical tastes of Sacred Harp's traditional adherents, the inhabitants of the rural South, had changed in important ways. Notably, gospel music - syncopated and chromatic, often with piano accompaniment - had become popular, along with a number of church hymns of the \"mainstream\" variety, such as \"Rock of Ages.\" Seven-shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four-shape system (see shape note for details). As time passed, Sacred Harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes.\n\nThe natural path to take—and the one ultimately taken—would be to assert the archaic character of Sacred Harp as an outright virtue. In this view, Sacred Harp should be treasured as a time-tested musical tradition, standing above current trends of fashion. The difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable, traditionalized version of Sacred Harp would take.\n\nThe first move was made by W. M. Cooper, of Dothan, Alabama, a leading Sacred Harp teacher in his own region, but not part of the inner circle of B. F. White's old colleagues and descendants. In 1902 Cooper prepared a revision of \"The Sacred Harp\" that, while retaining most of the old songs, also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles. Cooper made other changes, too:\n\n\nThe Cooper revision was a success, being widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The \"Cooper book,\" as it is now often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909. His son-in-law published the book in 1927, including an appendix compiled by revision committee. The Sacred Harp Book Company was formed in 1949, and subsequent revision has been supervised by editorial committees under its instruction. New editions were issued in 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006 and 2012.\n\nIn the original core geographic area of Sacred Harp singing, northern Alabama and Georgia, the singers did not in general take to the Cooper book, as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition. Obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that B. F. White's son James L. White, who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition, was a non-traditionalist. His \"fifth edition\" (1909) won little support among singers, while his \"fourth edition with supplement\" (1911) enjoyed some success in a few areas. Ultimately, a committee headed by Joseph Stephen James produced an edition entitled \"Original Sacred Harp\" (1911) that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers.\n\nThe James edition was further revised in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers Seaborn and Thomas Denson, both influential singing school teachers. Both died shortly before the project was complete, and the remaining work was overseen by Paine Denson, son of Thomas. This book was entitled \"Original Sacred Harp, Denson Revision\", and was itself revised 1960, 1967, and 1971; a more thorough revision and remodeling of this book, overseen by Hugh McGraw, is known simply as the \"1991 Edition,\" though some singers still call it the \"Denson book.\"\n\nEven the highly traditionalist James and Denson books followed Cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three-part songs (these alto parts led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Cooper). Some people (see for instance the reference by Buell Cobb given below) believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three-part songs. Wallace McKenzie (reference below) argues to the contrary, basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs. In any event, there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts, since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing.\n\nIt was thus that the traditionalism debate split the Sacred Harp community, and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book. However, there have been no further splits. Both the Denson and the Cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of Sacred Harp they favored, and these forms have now been stable for about a century.\n\nThe strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks. The Denson book is forthrightly Biblical in its defense of tradition:\n\n<poem>DEDICATED TO\nAll lovers of Sacred Harp Music, and to the memory of the illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the Traditional Style of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to \"seek the old paths and walk therein\".</poem>\n\nThe Cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition:\n\nMay God bless everyone as we endeavor to promote and enjoy Sacred Harp music and to continue the rich tradition of those who have gone before us.\n\nTo say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs. To the contrary, it is part of the tradition that musically creative Sacred Harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon. The new compositions are prepared in traditional styles, and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material. New songs have been incorporated into editions of \"The Sacred Harp\" throughout the 20th century.\n\nTwo other books are currently used by Sacred Harp singers. A few singers in north Georgia employ the \"White book,\" an expanded version of the 1869 B. F. White edition edited by J. L. White. African-American Sacred Harp singers, although primarily users of the Cooper book, also make use of a supplementary volume, \"The Colored Sacred Harp\", produced by Judge Jackson (1883–1958) in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions. In his book \"Judge Jackson and The Colored Sacred Harp\", Joe Dan Boyd identified four regions of Sacred Harp singing among African-Americans: eastern Texas (Cooper book), northern Mississippi (Denson book), south Alabama and Florida (Cooper book), and New Jersey (Cooper book). The \"Colored Sacred Harp\" is limited to the New Jersey and south Alabama-Florida groups. Sacred Harp was \"exported\" from south Alabama to New Jersey. It appears to have died out among the African-Americans in eastern Texas.\n\nIn summary, three revisions of and one companion book to \"The Sacred Harp\" are currently in use in Sacred Harp singing:\n\n\nSacred Harp books generally contain a section on rudiments, describing the basics of music and Sacred Harp singing.\n\nIn recent years, Sacred Harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.\n\nThere are now strong Sacred Harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the United States, and in many rural areas, as well. One of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional Southern home region of Sacred Harp singing was in the Chicago area. The first Illinois convention was held in 1985, with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent Southern traditional singers. The Midwest Convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major American conventions, attracting hundreds of singers from all over the US and abroad. Similarly, the Sacred Harp singing community in western New England has become a prominent one in recent years. In March 2008, the 2008 Western Massachusetts Sacred Harp Convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries. Other prominent singing conventions outside the South include, for example, the Keystone Convention in Pennsylvania, the Missouri Convention, and the Minnesota State Convention, which began in 1990.\n\nIn more recent times Sacred Harp singing has spread beyond the borders of the United States.\n\nThe United Kingdom has had an active Sacred Harp community since the 1990s. The first UK Sacred Harp convention took place in 1996. There are regular singings in London, the Home Counties, the Midlands, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Manchester, Brighton, Tyneside, East Anglia, Bristol, as well as in Scotland.\n\nCanada has a decades-long tradition of Sacred Harp singing, particularly in Southern Ontario and the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Singings have been organized weekly in Montreal, Quebec since 2011, as well as a monthly afternoon sing, and the first Montreal all-day sing took place in the spring of 2016. Sacred Harp singing has happened on a monthly basis for years in Toronto.\n\nAustralia has had Sacred Harp singing since 2001, and singings are held regularly in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Blackwood. The first Australian All Day Singing was held in Sydney in 2012.\n\nIn January 2009, Sacred Harp singing was introduced to Ireland, by Dr Juniper Hill of University College Cork, spreading quickly from a class module into the wider community. In March 2011 U.C.C. hosted the first annual Ireland Sacred Harp Convention, and the Cork community held their first All-Day Singing on 22 October 2011. There are now also growing Sacred Harp communities in Belfast and Dublin.\n\nIn the most recent development, Sacred Harp singing has expanded beyond the limits of English-speaking countries to mainland Europe. In 2008 a singing community was established in Poland (which hosted the first Camp Fasola Europe in September 2012). In Germany there are regular weekly or monthly singings in Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne and Munich, most of them with their own annual All-Day singings. Elsewhere in Germany, singers meet irregularly in Frankfurt, Gießen and Nürnberg. Recently groups have started up in Amsterdam, Paris and Clermont-Ferrand Oslo, Norway, and Uppsala, Sweden. Both the Swedish and Norwegian groups have arranged All Day Singings, the 5th Oslo All-Day Singing will be arranged June 1.-2. 2019 (singing school starting Friday evening).\n\nRegular singings are also taking place in Israel, and in April, 2016, an all-day singing was held in Paris, France.\n\nThe music used in Sacred Harp singing is eclectic. Most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers.\n\nThere are a few additional songs in \"The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition\" that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers. There are some very old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European classical composers (Ignaz Pleyel, Thomas Arne, and Henry Rowley Bishop).The book even includes five hymns by Lowell Mason, long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that \"The Sacred Harp\" has preserved to this day.\n\nThe description just given is based on \"The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition\", also known as the Denson edition. The widely used \"Cooper\" edition overlaps considerably (about 60%) in content, but also includes many later songs. A detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by Sacred Harp scholar Gaylon L. Powell, available here.\n\n\"The Sacred Harp\" was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books, with no fewer than four bearing the title. The first of these was compiled by John Hoyt Hickok and printed in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1832. The second was compiled by Lowell and Timothy Mason and printed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1834, as part of the \"better music\" movement mentioned above. The publisher released their book as a shape note edition, while they preferred to urbanize their audience by releasing a round note edition.\n\nThe third \"Sacred Harp\" was the one by B. F. White and E. J. King (1844), the origin of today's Sacred Harp singing tradition.\n\nLastly, according to W. J. Reynolds, writing in \"Hymns of Our Faith\", there was yet a fourth \"Sacred Harp\" - \"The Sacred Harp\" published by J. M. D. Cates in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867.\n\n\n\nSee also the bibliographic entries under Shape note.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "341075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341075", "title": "Gyro (food)", "text": "Gyro (food)\n\nA gyro or gyros (, \"gyros\" , literally 'turn') is a Greek dish made from meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Like shawarma and tacos al pastor, it is derived from the lamb-based doner kebab. In Greece it is now most often pork, or chicken, while a mixture of beef and lamb is common in the U.S. and other countries. It is usually served wrapped or stuffed in a flatbread such as pita, with tomato, onion, tzatziki sauce, and sometimes french fries.\n\nGrilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks was developed in Bursa by Turks in the 19th century Ottoman Empire, and called doner kebab (). Following World War II, doner kebab made with lamb was present in Athens, introduced by immigrants from Anatolia and the Middle East. A distinct Greek variation developed, often made with pork and served with tzatziki sauce, which later became known as gyros.\n\nBy 1970, gyros wrapped sandwiches were already a popular fast food in Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City. At that time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced in the US by Gyros Inc. of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still hand-made.\n\nAccording to Margaret Garlic, it was she who first came up with the idea to mass-produce gyros meat cones, after watching a demonstration by a Greek restaurant owner carving gyros on the \"What's My Line?\" television show. She convinced her husband John Garlic, a Jewish former Marine and at the time Cadillac salesman, of the idea. After obtaining a recipe from a Greek chef in Chicago, the couple rented a space in a sausage plant in Milwaukee, and began operating the world's first assembly line producing gyros meat from beef and lamb trimmings. The Garlics later sold their business to Gyros Inc., which along with Central Gyros Wholesale, and Kronos Foods, Inc, also of Chicago, began large-scale production in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe name comes from the Greek (\"circle\" or \"turn\"), and is a calque of the Turkish word , from , also meaning \"turn\". It was originally called () in Greece. The word was criticized in mid-1970s Greece for being Turkish. The word \"gyro\" or \"gyros\" was already in use in English by at least 1970, and along with in Greek, eventually came to replace \"doner kebab\" for the Greek version of the dish. Some Greek restaurants in the US, such as the \"Syntagma Square\" in New York City—which can be seen briefly in the 1976 film \"Taxi Driver\"—continued to use both \"doner kebab\" and \"gyros\" for the same dish, in the 1970s.\n\nIn contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens the skewered meat dish \"souvlaki\" is known as \"kalamaki\". A pita-wrapped sandwich made with either gyros meat or kalamaki is known as a \"souvlaki\".\n\nThe Greek pronunciation is , but the pronunciation in English is often or, occasionally or .\n\nIn Greek, \"gyros\" is a nominative singular noun, but the final 's' is often interpreted as an English plural in the U.S., leading to the formation of the singular \"gyro\".\n\nIn Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are used. Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely-ground beef mixed with lamb.\n\nFor hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spice mixes generally include salt, hot and sweet paprika, white and black pepper, dried parsley, garlic powder, and oregano. Additional spices are sometimes added (\"e.g.\" cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, anise, coriander, fennel, allspice, sumac).\n\nThe pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical rotisserie, which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or broiler. As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. If the meat is not fatty enough, strips of fat are added so that the roasting meat always remains moist and crisp. The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the strength of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of the spit rotation, allowing the cook to adjust to varying rates of consumption. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done. In Greece it is generally served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, fries, and tzatziki.\n\n"}
{"id": "342423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342423", "title": "Cuisine of California", "text": "Cuisine of California\n\nThe cuisine of California is the local cuisine of the U.S. state of California. It is noted for its emphasis on fresh, light, and health-conscious dishes, taking advantage of readily available produce and seafood. In addition, California's local cuisine incorporates elements of Latino, Spanish, Asian, and Oceanian food traditions, sometimes combined as fusion cuisine. \n\nA varied range of micro-climates, dominated by a mild Mediterranean climate, and health-conscious diets and lifestyles in California, promote the production, use and consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables and meats, many of them organic.\n\nIn Northern California, with wine country nearby, French, Italian, and Mediterranean inspired food is prominent, as well as Asian-inspired fare. Many of the restaurants, cafes, bistros, and grills use ingredients sourced from local growers and farmers' markets.\n\nThe California coast, especially the North Coast and Central Coast regions, is a source of seafood, which is a staple in the California diet.\n\nBattered and fried foods are not as common in California as they are in other regions, but there are several exceptions, such as fish tacos, tempura and french fries.\n\nThe agricultural diversity of California's Central Valley provides fresh produce in the state. On less than 1 percent of the total farmland in the US, the Central Valley produces 8 percent of the nation's agricultural output by value.\n\n\"Sunset\", a magazine of the West published in California, has featured recipes that have influenced the cuisine of California, including the promotion of outdoor eating.\n\nSouthern California's car culture and the population's reliance on automobiles for transportation throughout California's vast cities, has widely contributed to the popularity of the classic drive-in and modern drive-thru restaurants. Restaurant chains such as McDonald's, Jack in the Box, In-N-Out Burger, Carl's Jr., Wienerschnitzel, Del Taco, Taco Bell, Panda Express, Original Tommy's, Fatburger, and Big Boy were all established in Southern California.\n\nRegional fast food menus differ, generally depending on the ethnic composition of an area. In Southern California, smaller chains like The Hat feature hamburgers, Mexican food, chili fries, and pastrami.\n\nWhile gastropubs are not unique to California, the concept of the gourmet burger is very popular.\n\nBecause of California's mostly colonial European Spanish roots, Mexican territorial history, and its original population consisting of Meso-Americans, Spanish colonizers and Mexican ranchers, Mexican and Spanish-origin cuisine is very influential and popular in California, particularly Southern California.\n\nCommercial taquería-style Mexican fast food, consisting of offerings such as burritos, refried beans, tortas, tacos, nachos, quesadillas is widely popular. Taquerías can be found throughout California.\n\nTraditional Mexican food, while not as common as commercial food, is still widely prepared and abundant in the ethnic Mexican American border communities of San Diego, the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and in Mexican-American enclaves throughout California. Examples of these foods include tamales, tortillas, tostadas, mole, menudo, pozole, sopes, chile relleno and enchiladas.\n\nIn addition to Mexican food, California restaurants serve up nearly every variation of Central American food there is. For example, pupuserías are common in areas with a large population of Salvadorans (pupusas are stuffed tortillas from El Salvador).\n\nMore recently, \"Fresh Mex\" or \"Baja-style\" Mexican food, which places an emphasis on fresh ingredients and sometimes seafood, inspired by Baja California fare, is highly popular. El Pollo Loco, a fast food chain that originated in Northern Mexico, is a common sight. Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill, Baja Fresh, Wahoo's Fish Taco, Chronic Tacos, Chipotle, Qdoba and La Salsa are examples of the Baja-style Mexican American food trend.\n\nIn Northern California and the Central Coastal region, Dungeness crab is abundant. Sardines and Salmon were formerly major industries, before declines in fish stocks.. Cioppino (a fish stew) is a classic example of Northern Californian cuisine.\n\nAs one of the U.S. states nearest Asia and Oceania, and with long-standing Asian American and Oceanian American populations, the state tends to adopt foods from those national styles. The American sushi craze undoubtedly began in California; the term 'California roll' is used to describe sushi with avocado as a primary ingredient. These days, items like mochi ice cream and boba are popular.\n\nFusion cuisine is quite popular in California. The emphasis of California Cuisine is on the use of fresh, local ingredients which are often acquired daily at farmers markets. Menus are changed to accommodate the availability of ingredients in season. Some restaurants create a new menu daily.\n\nCalifornia chef Wolfgang Puck is known as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, popularizing such dishes as Chinese chicken salad at the restaurant Ma Maison in Los Angeles. His restaurant \"Chinois\" in Santa Monica was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former Imperial Dynasty restaurant in Hanford, California.\n\nCalifornia-style pizza focuses on non-traditional pizza ingredients, such as fresh produce and barbecued meats. First popularized by Wolfgang Puck's Spago restaurants, it was later brought to the masses by restaurants such as California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nBarbecue has been a part of California cuisine since the Mexicans cooked beef in pit barbecues on ranches in the 1840s. Santa Maria is famous for the Tri-tip, a special kind of beef cut that can be grilled, baked, braised, or roasted. California's barbecue style is also influenced by the regional Southwestern American styles of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, brought on by thousands of Dust-Bowl migrants. Chicken, beef ribs, sausages, and steaks are also routinely grilled or smoked in a pit. The barbecue sauce used in this state is tomato-based, as with all other western states. Santa Maria barbecue, however, uses no sauce, relying instead on the flavor of the tri-tip and the slow live oak fire over which it is cooked. Pork baby back ribs are popular for barbecue in the Western region in comparison to the popular use of spare ribs in the Southern United States.\n\nMany gourmet food products and companies had their start in California, including Peet's Coffee & Tea, one of the first purveyors of arabica coffee beans in the United States.\n\n\"The Migrant Kitchen\" is a five-part documentary series highlighting the ethnic cuisines and immigrants that have shaped—and continue to shape—the city of Los Angeles. Created in 2016, the series won a 2017 Emmy, and was nominated for a 2017 Webby Award and a 2017 James Beard Award. MarthaStewart.com says that \"The Migrant Kitchen\" \"explores Los Angeles' sprawling culinary landscape from a never-before-seen perspective -- immigrants.\" Adriana Maestas of \"Paste\" magazine says that \"From fine dining to casual eateries, viewers [of \"The Migrant Kitchen\"] get to learn firsthand how the migrant experience has shaped one of the largest dining meccas in the world.\" San Francisco PBS affiliate KQED (TV), in a press release, identified this series on \"migrant chefs\" as \"celebrating California\" and \"[reflecting] the diverse perspectives of our communities.\"\n\n"}

It is a rodeo event that features a calf and one mounted rider. The calves are moved one at a time through narrow runs leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors. The horse and rider wait in a box next to the chute that has a spring-loaded rope, known as the barrier, stretched in front. A light rope is fastened from the chute to the calf's neck, releasing once the calf is well away from the chute and releasing the barrier, which is used to ensure that the calf gets a head start. Once the barrier has released, the horse runs out of the box while the roper attempts to throw a lasso around the neck of the calf.\n\nOnce the rope is around the calf's neck, the roper signals the horse to stop suddenly. The rope is tied to the saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the timer. The fastest run wins.\n\nBreakaway roping is usually seen in junior, high school, college and semi-professional rodeos. At the collegiate level, it is a primarily a women's event, but at other levels competitors are both male and female. Some amateur rodeos also have breakaway roping as part of their event line-up. It is also used as a substitute for calf roping in some parts of Europe, where traditional calf roping, also called tie-down roping, is banned.\n"}
{"id": "344490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344490", "title": "Nachos", "text": "Nachos\n\nNachos is a Mexican dish from northern Mexico that consists of heated tortilla chips or \"totopos\" covered with melted cheese (or a cheese-based sauce), often served as a snack or appetizer. More elaborate versions of the dish add other ingredients, and may be substantial enough to serve as a main dish. Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya is credited with creating the dish around 1943; the original nachos consisted of fried corn tortilla chips covered with melted cheese and sliced jalapeño peppers.\n\nNachos originated in the city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, just over the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. In 1943, the wives of U.S. soldiers stationed at Fort Duncan in nearby Eagle Pass were in Piedras Negras on a shopping trip, and arrived at the restaurant after it had already closed for the day. The \"maître d'hôtel\", Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya, created a new snack for them with what little he had available in the kitchen: tortillas and cheese. Anaya cut the tortillas into triangles, fried them, added shredded cheddar cheese, quickly heated them, added sliced pickled jalapeño peppers, and served them.\n\nWhen asked what the dish was called, he answered, \"Nacho's \"especiales\"\". As word of the dish traveled, the apostrophe was lost, and Nacho's \"specials\" became \"special nachos\".\nAnaya went on to work at the Moderno Restaurant in Piedras Negras, which still uses the original recipe. He also opened his own restaurant, \"Nacho's Restaurant\", in Piedras Negras. Anaya's original recipe was printed in the 1954 \"St. Anne's Cookbook\".\n\nThe popularity of the dish swiftly spread throughout Texas and the Southwest. The first known appearance of the word \"nachos\" in English dates to 1950, from the book \"A Taste of Texas\". According to El Cholo Spanish Cafe history, waitress Carmen Rocha is credited with making nachos in San Antonio, Texas, before introducing the dish to Los Angeles at the cafe in 1959.\n\nA modified version of the dish, with cheese sauce and prepared tortilla chips, was marketed in 1976 by Frank Liberto, owner of Ricos Products, during Texas Rangers baseball games at Arlington Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This version became known as \"ballpark nachos\". During the September 4, 1978 \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys, sportscaster Howard Cosell enjoyed the name \"nachos\", and made a point of mentioning the dish in his broadcasts over the following weeks, further popularizing it and introducing it to a whole new audience.\n\nIgnacio Anaya died in 1975. In his honor, a bronze plaque was erected in Piedras Negras, and October 21 was declared the International Day of the Nacho. Anaya's son, Ignacio Anaya, Jr., served as a judge at the annual nacho competition until his death in 2010.\n\nThe nutritional breakdown and total calorie count for a serving of nachos typically depends on the type of nacho, type of cheese, and additional toppings (such as beef, jalapeños, etc.) that are included in the serving. Most typical corn tortilla chips contain about 15 calories per chip. Baked corn tortilla chips have about 6 calories per chip, making them a healthier alternative option to the usual fried chip. Mexican-style cheddar cheese contains about 110 calories per ounce. Adding an additional source of protein, such as chicken or beef, increases the calorie count by about 100 calories or so. All in all, a single serving of nachos can contain as much as 300–600 total calories.\n\nA single serving of nachos also contains significant amounts of fat, sodium, and calcium. There are around 16 grams of fat, 816 mg of sodium, and 272 mg of calcium per serving of nachos. In other words, one serving contains 39% of the daily value for fat, 34% of the daily value for sodium, and 27% of the daily value for calcium.\n\nA variation consists of a quartered and fried tostada topped with a layer of refried beans and/or various meats and a layer of shredded cheese or nacho cheese, topped with habanero hot sauce. \n\nOther variations include barbecue nachos (in which cheese is replaced with barbecue sauce) and poutine nachos (in which cheddar cheese is replaced with cheese curds and gravy). Although those variations use nontraditional ingredients, these versions are still classified as nachos.\n\nTraditional nachos consist of the tortilla chips topped with cheese and jalapenos, as done by Anaya who created \"nachos\". The modern form of nachos has several possible ingredients with the most common toppings being, cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos, and sometimes lettuce. Lettuce is a less common topping, if added at all. The topping of the greatest quantity is often the cheese.\n\nNachos vary from the modern style served in restaurants to the quick and easy nachos sold at concession stands in stadiums. The nachos sold at concession stands consists of tortilla chips topped with pump-able cheese sauce. The cheese sauce comes in condensed form to which water or milk and pepper juice are added. What is contained in the condensed form itself is a trade secret. Another variation of nachos is \"dessert nachos\". These vary widely, from cinnamon and sugar on pita chips to \"s'more nachos\" with marshmallow and chocolate on graham crackers, and typically refer to a dessert consisting of scattered toppings on some form of crispy base.\n\nCommon toppings include:\n\nSee also the common cheeses used:\nNachos with an abundance of toppings are sometimes called \"loaded nachos\", \"super nachos\", or \"epic nachos\". This type of dish is usually served as an appetizer at bars or restaurants in the United States and elsewhere. Typically, the tortilla chips are arranged on a platter, meat and refried bean toppings are then added, and the entire platter is smothered with shredded cheese. The platter is then put into a broiler or microwave to cause the cheese to melt. The platter is then covered with the cold toppings (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, jalapeños, etc.) and served immediately.\n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, barbecue nachos are served in most barbecue restaurants, and also at sporting events. Generous portions of barbecued pork shoulder are placed atop tortilla chips, then covered with melted cheese or nacho cheese, barbecue sauce, and sliced jalapeño peppers.\n\nIn Hawaii, kalua pork and pineapple nachos are served in many restaurants and bars. Generous portions of kalua pork and pineapple bits are placed atop tortilla chips, then covered with melted cheese or nacho cheese, and varied toppings.\n\nA similar dish that involves tortilla chips and cheese is found in Tex-Mex restaurants. Small bowls of chili con queso and/or, more commonly, salsa, are served with baskets of warm tortilla chips as appetizers.\n\nA form of processed cheese sauce mixed with peppers and other spices is often used in place of freshly shredded cheese in institutional or large-scale production settings, such as schools, movie theaters, sports venues, and convenience stores, or wherever using freshly grated cheese may be logistically prohibitive. Though originally formulated as a cheaper and more convenient source of cheese to top nachos, this dip has become popular enough in the U.S. that it is available in some Mexican-themed restaurants, and at major grocery stores, in both name-brand (Frito-Lay, Tostitos, and Taco Bell) and unbranded versions.\n\nIn the United States, National Nacho Day is celebrated on November 6. The International Nacho Festival is held between October 13 and 15 at Piedras Negras, the birthplace of nachos, and features live music, art, cultural activities, and a \"biggest nacho of the world\" contest which is registered with the \"Guinness World Records\".\n\nOn April 21, 2012, the world's biggest serving of nachos was made by Centerplate at University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. It weighed 4,689 pounds and contained 765 pounds of nacho chips, 405 pounds of salsa, 323 pounds of tomato, 918 pounds of meat and beans, and more than 2,200 pounds of cheese.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "344611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344611", "title": "Nougat", "text": "Nougat\n\nNougat ( , , or ; ; Azerbaijani: لوکا; Persian: ) is a family of confections made with sugar or honey, roasted nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts are common), whipped egg whites, and sometimes chopped candied fruit. The consistency of nougat is chewy, and it is used in a variety of candy bars and chocolates. The word \"nougat\" comes from Occitan \"pan nogat\" (), seemingly from Latin \"panis nucatus\" 'nut bread' (the late colloquial Latin adjective \"nucatum\" means 'nutted' or 'nutty').\n\nThere are three basic kinds of nougat. The first, and most common, is white nougat (' or ' in Italy, ' in Spain), made with beaten egg whites and honey; it appeared in Cologna Veneta, Italy, in the early 15th century, in Alicante, Spain with the first published recipe in the 16th century, and in Montélimar, France, in the 18th century. The second is brown nougat (\"nougat noir\" in French, literally \"black nougat\"), which is made without egg whites and has a firmer, often crunchy texture. The third is the Viennese or German nougat which is essentially a chocolate and nut (usually hazelnut) praline.\n\nMany legends exist around nougat’s origins. The early recipes of white nougat, probably borrowed from Central Asia, were found in a Middle Eastern book in Baghdad the 10th century. That nougat was called '. One of these recipes indicates that the ' comes from Harran, a city located between Urfa (now in southeast Turkey) and Aleppo, Syria. Mention of ' was found in a triangle between Urfa, Aleppo, and Baghdad. At the end of the 10th century, the traveler and geographer Ibn Hawqal wrote that he ate some ' in Manbij (in modern Syria) and Bukhara (in modern Uzbekistan).\n\nIn southern Europe, nougat is an important component of all Christmas meals.\n\n' is produced in Spain, \"Nougat\" in southern France, ', ' or even ' and \"cubbaita\" – from Latin ' in Cremona, Taurianova and Sicily in Italy, in Greece where it is known as ' or ', Malta (where it is known as ' and sold in village festivals), Romania (where it is known as \"\" sold in local festivals and fairgrounds, mainly on the Sunday of Forgiveness preceding the Easter Lent), and in local variant form in Tabriz, Iran where it is known as \"Luka\".\n\nThe nougat that appears in many modern candy bars in the United States and United Kingdom is different from traditional recipes, being a mixture of sucrose and corn syrup aerated with a whipping agent such as egg white or hydrolyzed soya protein or gelatine. It may also include vegetable fats and milk powder. This type of nougat is often used as a filler by large candy companies, since it is inexpensive to make. Typically it is combined with nuts, caramel, or chocolate. But some American confections feature such nougat as the primary component, rather than one of several. Varieties of nougat are found in Reese's Fast Break, Snickers, Double Decker, ZERO bars, and Baby Ruth bars. Whipped nougat is the feature ingredient in 3 Musketeers bars.\n\nIn Britain, nougat is traditionally made in the style of the southern European varieties, and is commonly found at fairgrounds and seaside resorts. The most common industrially produced type is coloured pink and white, the pink often fruit flavoured, and sometimes wrapped in edible rice paper with almonds and cherries.\n\nSpanish \"\" follows the traditional recipes with toasted nuts (commonly almonds), sugar, honey, and egg whites.\n\n' from Italy includes these same basic ingredients as well as vanilla or citrus flavoring, and is often sandwiched between two very thin sheets of rice paper. The Venetian town of Cologna Veneta is well known for its nougat production, especially the type called ', always based on honey, sugar, egg whites, and almonds (also known as ' in Italian) but with a different taste and harder to bite than '.\n\n\"Wiener (Viennese) Nougat\" is a variant which contains only sugar, cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass, and has a mellow consistency. The nuts used for Viennese nougat are usually hazelnuts. In Germany and the Nordic countries, Viennese nougat is what has traditionally been associated with and labelled as nougat, while in Sweden and Denmark the original nougat is referred to as \"French nougat\". In Germany, gianduja is traditionally called nougat.\n\n"}

Custard powder and instant custard powder are the generic product names for similar and competing products. The product is a cornflour-based powder which thickens to form a custard-like sauce when mixed with milk and heated.\n\nBird's Custard was first formulated and first cooked by Alfred Bird in 1837 at his chemist shop in Birmingham. He developed the recipe because his wife was allergic to eggs, the key ingredient used to thicken traditional custard. The Birds continued to serve real custard to dinner guests, until one evening when the egg-free custard was served instead, either by accident or design. The dessert was so well received by the other diners that Alfred Bird put the recipe into wider production.\n\nIn some regions, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the popularity of this type of dessert is such that it is simply known as \"custard\". In such cases, general usage of the word may be more likely to refer to the \"Bird's\" custard rather than to the traditional egg-based variety.\n\nBird's Custard and other brands mimicking its composition are also popular in India, where a large portion of the populace follows a vegetarian diet, although ovo-lacto variants are also available.\n\n\"Instant\" versions (containing powdered milk and sugar and requiring only hot water) and ready-made custard in tins, plastic pots and cartons have also become popular.\n\nA food and drink survey carried out in 2000 found 99% of customers recognised the brand, which accounts for 45% of the custard consumed in the UK. Bird's Custard is also exported to several countries, and can be found in many popular grocery supermarkets.\n\nIn addition to the Bird's brand, generic cornflour-based custards are widely available.\n\nAfter he discovered his custard was popular, Bird formed Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd. in Birmingham. By 1843, the company was also making the newly invented baking powder and, by 1844, was promoting custard powder nationally. By 1895, the company was producing blancmange powder, jelly powder, and egg substitute. In World War I, Bird's Custard was supplied to the British armed forces.\n\nThe company was one of the early users of promotional items and colourful advertising campaigns. The famous 'three bird' logo, however, was relatively late in arriving, only introduced in 1929.\n\nWorld War II saw rationing and serious production limits. Shortly after the war, Bird's was purchased by the General Foods Corporation, which was itself taken over by Philip Morris in the 1980s and merged into Kraft Foods. Although the Bird's Custard product remains, the company itself is now just a brand. In late 2004, Kraft sold Bird's Custard and some other Kraft brands to Premier Foods, who are the current owners.\n\nIn 1958, the company acquired Monk and Glass, a rival custard powder manufacturer based in London.\n\nThe original custard factory has long ceased to exist, but the larger factory Bird's opened in Gibb Street remains (production was relocated to Banbury in 1964, along with the factory gates, featuring the company logo), and has been adapted as the Custard Factory arts centre.\n\nThough cooked custard is a weak gel, viscous and thixotropic, a suspension of \"uncooked\" custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, which is to say that it becomes more viscous when under pressure. This suspension is termed oobleck and often used in science demonstrations of non-Newtonian fluids. The popular-science programme \"\" demonstrated dilatancy dramatically by filling a swimming pool with this mixture and having presenter Jon Tickle walk across it.\n\nUntil 2009 many Bird's products, such as its instant custard powder, contained partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, a product now banned in some countries due to health concerns relating to heart disease. Since then, all Bird's custards have moved to unhydrogenated vegetable oil.\n\n"}
{"id": "346477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346477", "title": "Antique", "text": "Antique\n\nA true antique (; \"old\", \"ancient\") is an item perceived as having value because of its aesthetic or historical significance, and often defined as at least 100 years old (or some other limit), although the term is often used loosely to describe any object that is old. An antique is usually an item that is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human history. Vintage and collectible are used to describe items that are old, but do not meet the 100-year criteria.\n\nAntiques are usually objects that show some degree of craftsmanship, collectability, or a certain attention to design, such as a desk or an early automobile. They are bought at antique shops, estate sales, auction houses, online auctions, and other venues, or estate inherited. Antique dealers often belong to national trade associations, many of which belong to CINOA, a confederation of art and antique associations across 21 countries that represents 5,000 dealers.\n\nThe common definition of \"antique\" is a collectible object such as a piece of furniture or work of art that has a high value because of its considerable age, but it varies depending on the source, product, and year. Motor vehicles are an exception to the 100-year rule. The customary definition of antique requires that an item should be at least 100 years old and in original condition.\n\nIn the United States, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act defined antiques as, \"...works of art (except rugs and carpets made after the year 1700), collections in illustration of the progress of the arts, works in bronze, marble, terra cotta, parian, pottery, or porcelain, artistic antiquities and objects of ornamental character or educational value which shall have been produced prior to the year 1830.\" 1830 was the approximate beginning of mass production in the United States. These definitions were intended to allow people of that time to distinguish between genuine antique pieces, vintage items, and collectible objects.\n\nThe alternative term, \"antiquities\", commonly refers to the remains of ancient art and everyday items from antiquity, which themselves are often archaeological artifacts. An \"antiquarian\" is a person who collects and studies antiquities or things of the past.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese antiques are marked by a red seal, known as a 'chop', placed there by an owner. Experts can identify previous owners of an antique by reading the chops. The pre-revolution Chinese government tried to assist collectors of Chinese antiques by requiring their Department of Antiquities to provide a governmental chop on the bottom of a Chinese antique. This chop is visible as a piece of red sealing wax that bears the government chop to verify the date of the antique. The government of the People's Republic of China has its own definitions of what it considers \"antique\". As of the Cultural Revolution and China's opening trade to other countries, the government has tried to protect the definition of a Chinese antique.\n\n\"Antiquing\" is the act of shopping, identifying, negotiating, or bargaining for antiques. People buy items for personal use, gifts, or profit. Sources for antiquing include garage sales and yard sales, estate sales, resort towns, antique districts, collectives, and international auction houses.\n\nNote that \"antiquing\" also means the craft of making an object appear antique through distressing or using the antique-looking paint applications. Often, individuals get confused between these handmade distressed vintage or modern items and true antiques. Would-be antique collectors who are unaware of the differences may find themselves paying a high amount of money for something that has little value in the antiquing industry.\n\nAntique furniture is a popular area of antiques because furniture has obvious practical uses as well as collector value. Many collectors use antique furniture pieces in their homes, and care for them with the hope that the value of these items will remain same or appreciate. This is in contrast to buying new furniture, which typically depreciates from the moment of purchase.\n\nAntique furniture includes dining tables, chairs, bureaus, chests etc. The most common woods are mahogany, oak, pine, walnut, and rosewood. Chinese antique furniture is often made with elm, a wood common to many regions in Asia. Each wood has a distinctive grain and color. Many modern pieces of furniture use laminate or wood veneer to achieve the same effect. There are a number of different styles of antique furniture depending on when and where it was made. Some examples of stylistic periods are: Arts & Crafts, Georgian, Regency, and Victorian.\n\n"}
{"id": "347454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347454", "title": "Larb", "text": "Larb\n\nLarb (; , , , also spelled , , or ) is a type of Lao meat salad that is regarded as the \"unofficial\" national dish of Laos. It is also eaten in the Isan region, an area of Thailand where the majority of the population is of the Lao ethnicity. The Hmong people, an ethnic minority group who migrated into the country in the nineteenth century, have adopted the Lao dish along with many other elements of Lao cuisine. Local variants of \"larb\" also feature in the cuisines of the Tai peoples of Shan State, Burma, and Yunnan province, China.\n\n\"Larb\" is most often made with chicken, beef, duck, fish, pork or mushrooms, flavored with fish sauce, lime juice, padaek, roasted ground rice and fresh herbs. The meat can be either raw or cooked; it is minced and mixed with chili, mint and, optionally, assorted vegetables. Roughly ground toasted rice (\"khao khoua\") is also a very important component of the dish. The dish is served at room temperature and usually with a serving of sticky rice and raw vegetables.\n\nThe \"larb\" from northern Thailand - \"larb Lanna\" - is very different from the internationally more well-known Lao style \"larb\". The northern Thai \"larb\" of the Tai Nyuan/Khon Muang (Northern Thai people) does not contain fish sauce and is not sour, as neither lime juice nor any other souring agent is used. Instead, the northern Thai version uses a mix of dried spices as flavoring and seasoning which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon amongst others, derived from the location of northern Thailand's Lanna Kingdom on one of the spice routes to China, in addition to ground dried chillies, and, in the case of \"larb\" made with pork or chicken, also the blood of the animal used. The dish can be eaten raw (\"larb dip\"), but also after it has been stir-fried for a short time (\"larb suk\"). If blood is omitted from the preparation of the stir-fried version, the dish is called \"larb khua\". There is also a kind of \"larb\" called \"larb luat\" () or \"lu\" (). This dish is made with minced raw pork or beef, raw blood, kidney, fat and bile, and mixed with spices, crispy fried onions, fresh herbs and other ingredients. \"Larb\" and its other variations are served with an assortment of fresh vegetables and herbs, and eaten with glutinous rice. This version of \"larb\" is viewed as having originated in the town of Phrae, in northern Thailand. This style of \"larb\" can also be found in parts of northern Laos.\n\n\"Saa\" () is a term used to describe a larb-like dish with the meat sliced thinly rather than minced.\n\n\"Nam tok\" (, ) is a Lao and Thai word meaning 'waterfall'. The name is derived either from the dripping of the meat juices during the grilling or from the juices running out of the medium rare beef as it is sliced. It refers to a popular Lao meat dish in both Laos and Isan, where it is commonly known as \"ping sin nam tok\" (Laos) or \"nuea yang nam tok\" (Thailand). This dish can be regarded as a variation on the standard \"larb\", and is made from barbecued pork or beef, usually the neck, which is sliced in bite-size pieces. The meat is then brought to a boil with some stock to create sauce. The heat is turned off, and then sliced shallots, ground roasted rice, chili powder, lime juice, and fish sauce are added, along with shredded coriander leaves, spring onions and mint leaves.\n\nThe risks from eating raw meat include contracting trichinosis, caused by an infectious worm, along with fatal bacterial or potentially rabies infection.\nThe consumption of raw \"larb\" and \"lu\" made with raw pork has led to several cases of human \"Streptococcus suis\" infections in Thailand, some of them with a deadly result.\n\nThe consumption of raw freshwater fish can lead to an infection by \"Opisthorchis viverrini\" (Southeast Asian liver fluke), a parasitical flatworm that can live for many years inside the human liver. Northern Thailand, where certain fishes are consumed fermented, has the highest recorded rate of medically untreatable cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "347493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347493", "title": "Crème anglaise", "text": "Crème anglaise\n\nCrème anglaise (French for \"English cream\") is a light pouring custard used as a dessert cream or sauce. It is a mix of sugar, egg yolks, oil, and hot milk often flavoured with vanilla. Its name may derive from the prevalence of sweet custards in English desserts.\n\nThe cream is made by whipping egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white, and then slowly adding hot oil and milk, while whisking. This process is commonly referred to as tempering. Vanilla beans (seeds) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal. The sauce is then cooked over low heat (excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook, resulting in scrambled eggs) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and then removed from the heat. It is also possible to set the sauce into custard cups and bake in a bain-marie until the egg yolks set. If the sauce reaches too high a temperature, it will curdle, although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath. Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C (156 °F) and 85 °C (185 °F); the higher the temperature, the thicker the resulting cream, as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture.\n\nThis can be poured as a sauce over cakes or fruits. Alternatively, it can be drunk as a dessert on its own, for example in \"Île flottante\" (\"floating island\"): the cream is poured into a bowl with a piece of meringue (\"blancs en neige\") floated on top along with praline. It can also be used as a base for desserts such as ice cream or crème brûlée. It has a mild taste but a rich, and thick vanilla flavor. However, the ice cream base is much thicker and has various flavorings. In the American South it is occasionally known as \"custard.\" It can be served like eggnog during the Christmas season.\n\nOther names include the French terms \"crème à l'anglaise\" (\"English-style cream\") and \"crème française\" (\"French cream\").\n\n"}
{"id": "347838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347838", "title": "Nuclear medicine", "text": "Nuclear medicine\n\nNuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuclear medicine, in a sense, is \"radiology done inside out\" or \"endoradiology\" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason, it is called a physiological imaging modality. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.\n\nIn nuclear medicine imaging, radiopharmaceuticals are taken internally, for example, intravenously or orally. Then, external detectors (gamma cameras) capture and form images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. This process is unlike a diagnostic X-ray, where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.\n\nThere are several techniques of diagnostic nuclear medicine. \n\nNuclear medicine tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and octreotide scans.\n\nWhile the ability of nuclear metabolism to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is unsurpassed, it is not unique. Certain techniques such as fMRI image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.\n\nDiagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a tracer. In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a \"hot spot\", which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a \"cold spot\". Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.\n\nIn some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.\n\nAlthough the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, \"ALARP\". (Originally, this was known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the \"Reasonably\" and less on the \"Achievable\".)\n\nWorking with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified. This needs to take into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.\n\nWhen the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.\n\nAs a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study. The effective radiation dose can be lower than or comparable to or can far exceed the general day-to-day environmental annual background radiation dose. Likewise, it can also be less than, in the range of, or higher than the radiation dose from an abdomen/pelvis CT scan.\n\nSome nuclear medicine procedures require special patient preparation before the study to obtain the most accurate result. Pre-imaging preparations may include dietary preparation or the withholding of certain medications. Patients are encouraged to consult with the nuclear medicine department prior to a scan.\n\nThe end result of the nuclear medicine imaging process is a \"dataset\" comprising one or more images. In multi-image datasets the array of images may represent a time sequence (i.e. cine or movie) often called a \"dynamic\" dataset, a cardiac gated time sequence, or a spatial sequence where the gamma-camera is moved relative to the patient. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is the process by which images acquired from a rotating gamma-camera are reconstructed to produce an image of a \"slice\" through the patient at a particular position. A collection of parallel slices form a slice-stack, a three-dimensional representation of the distribution of radionuclide in the patient.\n\nThe nuclear medicine computer may require millions of lines of source code to provide quantitative analysis packages for each of the specific imaging techniques available in nuclear medicine.\n\nTime sequences can be further analysed using kinetic models such as multi-compartment models or a Patlak plot.\n\nRadionuclide therapy can be used to treat conditions such as hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer, and blood disorders.\n\nIn nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) rather than from an external radiation source.\n\nThe radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Most nuclear medicine therapies can be performed as outpatient procedures since there are few side effects from the treatment and the radiation exposure to the general public can be kept within a safe limit.\n\nCommon nuclear medicine (unsealed source) therapies\nIn some centers the nuclear medicine department may also use implanted capsules of isotopes (brachytherapy) to treat cancer.\n\nCommonly used radiation sources (radionuclides) for brachytherapy\n\nThe history of nuclear medicine contains contributions from scientists across different disciplines in physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine makes it difficult for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for medicine related use, in 1946.\n\nThe origins of this medical idea date back as far as the mid-1920s in Freiburg, Germany, when George de Hevesy made experiments with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the tracer principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when John Lawrence, known as \"the father of nuclear medicine\", took a leave of absence from his faculty position at Yale Medical School, to visit his brother Ernest Lawrence at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used phosphorus-32 to treat leukemia.\nMany historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine. In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal \"Nature\", after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen for X-ray, Henri Becquerel for radioactive uranium salts, and Marie Curie (mother of Irène Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term \"radioactivity.\" Taro Takemi studied the application of nuclear physics to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers.\nNuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty when on May 11,1946 an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Massachusetts General Hospital's Dr. Saul Hertz and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dr.Arthur Roberts, described the successful use of treating Graves' Disease with radioactive iodine (RAI) was published. Additionally, Sam Seidlin. brought further development in the field describing a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). These articles are considered by many historians as the most important article ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a generator system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed in a wide variety of nuclear medicine imaging studies.\nWidespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first rectilinear scanner and Hal O. Anger's scintillation camera (Anger camera) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.\n\nBy the early 1960s, in southern Scandinavia, Niels A. Lassen, , and developed techniques that provided the first blood flow maps of the brain, which initially involved xenon-133 inhalation; an intra-arterial equivalent was developed soon after, enabling measurement of the local distribution of cerebral activity for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Later versions would have 254 scintillators so a two-dimensional image could be produced on a color monitor. It allowed them to construct images reflecting brain activation from speaking, reading, visual or auditory perception and voluntary movement. The technique was also used to investigate, e.g., imagined sequential movements, mental calculation and mental spatial navigation.\nBy the 1970s most organs of the body could be visualized using nuclear medicine procedures. In 1971, American Medical Association officially recognized nuclear medicine as a medical specialty. In 1972, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, and in 1974, the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.\nIn the 1980s, radiopharmaceuticals were designed for use in diagnosis of heart disease. The development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), around the same time, led to three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart and establishment of the field of nuclear cardiology.\n\nMore recent developments in nuclear medicine include the invention of the first positron emission tomography scanner (PET). The concept of emission and transmission tomography, later developed into single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), was introduced by David E. Kuhl and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s. Their work led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the University of Pennsylvania. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed at the Washington University School of Medicine. These innovations led to fusion imaging with SPECT and CT by Bruce Hasegawa from University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the first PET/CT prototype by D. W. Townsend from University of Pittsburgh in 1998.\n\nPET and PET/CT imaging experienced slower growth in its early years owing to the cost of the modality and the requirement for an on-site or nearby cyclotron. However, an administrative decision to approve medical reimbursement of limited PET and PET/CT applications in oncology has led to phenomenal growth and widespread acceptance over the last few years, which also was facilitated by establishing 18F-labelled tracers for standard procedures, allowing work at non-cyclotron-equipped sites. PET/CT imaging is now an integral part of oncology for diagnosis, staging and treatment monitoring. A fully integrated MRI/PET scanner is on the market from early 2011.\n\nAbout a third of the world's supply, and most of Europe's supply, of medical isotopes is produced at the Petten nuclear reactor in the Netherlands. Another third of the world's supply, and most of North America's supply, is produced at the Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. The NRU started operating in 1957. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ordered the National Research Universal reactor to be shut down on November 18, 2007 for regularly scheduled maintenance and an upgrade of the safety systems to modern standards. The upgrade took longer than expected, and in December 2007 a critical shortage of medical isotopes occurred. The Canadian government passed emergency legislation allowing the reactor to restart on 16 December 2007, and production of medical isotopes to continue. In mid-February, 2009, the reactor was shut down once again due to a mechanism problem that extracts the isotope containing rods from the reactor. The reactor was again shut down in mid May of the same year because of a heavy water leak. The reactor was started again during the first quarter of 2010. The NRU will cease routine production in the fall of 2016, however the reactor will be available for backup production until March 2018, at which point it will be shut down.\n\nThe Chalk River reactor is used to irradiate materials with neutrons which are produced in great quantity during the fission of U-235. These neutrons change the nucleus of the irradiated material by adding a neutron, or by splitting it in the process of nuclear fission. In a reactor, one of the fission products of uranium is molybdenum-99 which is extracted and shipped to radiopharmaceutical houses all over North America. The Mo-99 radioactively beta decays with a half-life of 2.7 days (or 66 hours), turning initially into Tc-99m, which is then extracted (milked) from a \"moly cow\" (see technetium-99m generator). The Tc-99m then further decays, while inside a patient, releasing a gamma photon which is detected by the gamma camera. It decays to its ground state of Tc-99, which is relatively non-radioactive compared to Tc-99m.\n\nThe most commonly used radioisotope in PET F-18, is not produced in any nuclear reactor, but rather in a circular accelerator called a cyclotron. The cyclotron is used to accelerate protons to bombard the stable heavy isotope of oxygen O-18. The O-18 constitutes about 0.20% of ordinary oxygen (mostly O-16), from which it is extracted. The F-18 is then typically used to make FDG (see this link for more information on this process).\n\nA typical nuclear medicine study involves administration of a radionuclide into the body by intravenous injection in liquid or aggregate form, ingestion while combined with food, inhalation as a gas or aerosol, or rarely, injection of a radionuclide that has undergone micro-encapsulation. Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide (leukocyte scintigraphy and red blood cell scintigraphy). Most diagnostic radionuclides emit gamma rays either directly from their decay or indirectly through electron-positron annihilation, while the cell-damaging properties of beta particles are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine are derived from fission or fusion processes in nuclear reactors, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or cyclotrons, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.\n\nThe most commonly used intravenous radionuclides are Technetium-99m (technetium-99m), \nIodine-123 and 131, \nThallium-201, \nGallium-67, Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, and Indium-111 Labeled Leukocytes\n\nThe most commonly used gaseous/aerosol radionuclides are xenon-133, krypton-81m, Technetium-99m and technetium-99m DTPA\n\nA patient undergoing a nuclear medicine procedure will receive a radiation dose. Under present international guidelines it is assumed that any radiation dose, however small, presents a risk. The radiation dose delivered to a patient in a nuclear medicine investigation, though unproven, is generally accepted to present a very small risk of inducing cancer. In this respect it is similar to the risk from X-ray investigations except that the dose is delivered internally rather than from an external source such as an X-ray machine, and dosage amounts are typically significantly higher than those of X-rays.\n\nThe radiation dose from a nuclear medicine investigation is expressed as an effective dose with units of sieverts (usually given in millisieverts, mSv). The effective dose resulting from an investigation is influenced by the amount of radioactivity administered in megabecquerels (MBq), the physical properties of the radiopharmaceutical used, its distribution in the body and its rate of clearance from the body.\n\nEffective doses can range from 6 μSv (0.006 mSv) for a 3 MBq chromium-51 EDTA measurement of glomerular filtration rate to 37 mSv (37,000 μSv) for a 150 MBq thallium-201 non-specific tumour imaging procedure. The common bone scan with 600 MBq of technetium-99m-MDP has an effective dose of approximately 3.5 mSv (3,500 μSv) (1).\n\nFormerly, units of measurement were the curie (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 grams of Radium (Ra-226); the rad (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the gray; and the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced with the sievert. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively before the advent of nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of Health Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.\n\n\n\n"}

Shortly after release, production was halted due to a problem with label printing. Michele Ferrero, the credited inventor, named the chocolate after a grotto in the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes, \"Rocher de Massabielle\". \"Rocher\" comes from the French and means \"rock\" or \"boulder\".\n\nThe chocolate consisted of a whole roasted hazelnut (but since late 2017, only part of a hazelnut had been used) encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut chocolate and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts. Its ingredients are milk chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, skim milk powder, butteroil, lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin (artificial flavor), hazelnuts, palm oil, wheat flour, whey (milk), lowfat cocoa powder, sodium bicarbonate (leavening agent), and salt.\n\nThe production process is secretive, with no smartphones or notebooks allowed inside, and, as of 2015, few journalists have ever been invited to visit. As of 2015, the production in the Alba factory is 24 million Rochers a day.\n\nThe sweet is produced by machinery. The process begins with flat sheets of wafer with hemispheres moving down an assembly line. The hemispheres of the wafers are then filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream and part of a hazelnut. Next, two of these wafer sheets, one with a hazelnut and one with hazelnut chocolate cream, are clamped together. The excess wafer is cut away producing wafer balls. These balls are then coated with a layer of chocolate, a layer of chopped hazelnuts, and a final layer of chocolate before the chocolate is packaged.\n\nRoughly 3.6 billion Ferrero Rochers are sold each year in over 40 countries. These include 28 countries in Europe, 9 countries in the Americas, 9 countries in Asia, 2 countries in the Oceania region, and 2 countries in Africa.\n\nFerrero Rochers are associated with Christmas and New Year. As of 2015, 61% of Ferrero Rochers were sold during the last three months of the year.\n\nIn the United Kingdom in the 1990s, an advertisement series was based upon a party in a European ambassador's official residence and it has been repeatedly parodied in popular culture since. There has been discussion about the socio-economic targeting of the advertisement and the extent to which it may or may not be insulting to the more down-market audience to whom it was presented as an aspirational brand by means of an Italian advertisement dubbed in English.\n\nIn September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Ferrero Rocher and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world's two largest cocoa producers.\n\nThe report documents how in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies' laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country's elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200–400.\n\n\n"}

Typically a Veronese product, pandoro is traditionally shaped like a frustum with an eight-pointed star section.\n\nIt is often served dusted with vanilla-scented icing sugar made to resemble the snowy peaks of the Italian Alps during Christmas.\n\nPandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, \"pan d'oro\" (literally: 'golden bread'), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey were served in the palaces and were known as \"royal bread\" or \"golden bread\".\n\nThe desserts consumed in the 17th century were described in the book \"Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father\", published by La Rosa of Turin, and they included \"royal bread\" made from flour, sugar, butter and eggs. However, the bread was already known and appreciated in the ancient Rome of Pliny the Elder, in the 1st century. That bread was made with \"the finest flour combined with eggs, butter and oil\". Virgil and Livy mentioned the preparation under the name Libum.\n\nThe first citation of a dessert clearly identified as pandoro dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian aristocracy. Venice was the principal market for spices as late as the 18th century, as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and breads made from leavened dough. And it was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "349575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349575", "title": "Wand", "text": "Wand\n\nA wand is a thin, light-weight rod that is held with one hand, and is traditionally made of wood, but may also be made of other materials, such as metal or plastic. A wand that is used for magical purposes is often called a magic wand, rather than simply a wand. Wands are distinct from scepters, which have a greater thickness, are held differently, and have a relatively large top ornament on them.\n\nIn modern times, wands are usually associated with stage magic or real magic, but there have been other uses, all stemming from the original meaning as a synonym of rod and virge. A stick that is used for reaching, pointing, drawing in the dirt, and directing other people, is one of the earliest and simplest of tools.\n\nIn British formal government ceremony, special officials may carry a wand of office that represents their power. Compare in this context the function of the ceremonial mace, the scepter, and the staff of office. Its age may be even greater, as Stone Age cave paintings show figures holding sticks, which may be symbolic representations of their power.\n\nWands are used in The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Thelema, and Wicca, and by casual practitioners of magic.\n\nWands were introduced into the occult via the 1200s latin grimoire The Oathbound Book of Honorius. The wand idea from the Book of Honorius, along with various other ideas from that grimoire, were later incorporated into the 1500s grimoire The Key of Solomon. The Key of Solomon became popular among occultists for hundreds of years. In 1888, there was the publication of an English translation of the Key of Solomon by Samuel Mathers (one of the co-founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn), which made the text of the Key of Solomon available to the anglophone world. That 1888 English version inspired Gerald Gardner- the creator of Wicca, to incorporate the wand and various other ritual objects into Wicca.\n\nThe creators of the Golden Dawn got their idea to use a wand, as well as their other main ritual objects (dagger, sword, hexagrammic pentacle, and cup), from the writings of the mid-1800s occultist author Eliphas Levi. Levi himself mentioned most of those objects (all except for the cup) in his writings because they are in the Key of Solomon, whereas he got the cup from the tarot suit of cups. In Levi's 1862 book Philosophie Occulte, he wrote a fake excerpt of a Hebrew version of the Key of Solomon, and that fake excerpt was part of the inspiration for the Golden Dawn's ritual objects, and especially their lotus wand.\n\nThe ceremonial magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn uses several different types of wands for different purposes, the most prominent of which are the fire wand and the lotus wand. In Wicca, wands are traditionally used to summon and control angels and genies, but have later come to also be used for general spell-casting. Wands serve a similar purpose to athames, though the two objects have their distinct uses: An athame is used to command, whereas a wand is seen as more gentle, and is used to invite or encourage. Though wands are traditionally made of wood, they may also be made of metal or crystal. Practitioners usually prune a branch from an oak, hazel, or other tree, or may even buy wood from a hardware store, and then carve it and add decorations to personalize it, though one can also purchase ready-made wands. In Wicca, the wand usually represents the element air, or sometimes fire (following the wiccan author Raymond Buckland, who got his element associations from the Golden Dawn), although contemporary wand-makers also create wands for the elements of earth and water.\n\nThe suit of wands is one of the four suits in the 1909 Rider-Waite-Smith occult tarot deck, and other, later tarot decks that are based upon that deck. The suit of wands replaced the suit of batons from earlier, non-occult tarot decks. The Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck also replaced the suit of coins from earlier, non-occult decks, with the suit of pentacles. The Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck was designed by two members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn- Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Colman Smith. Waite provided the general guidelines for the deck (including the names of the four suits, and thus the suit of wands), and detailed guidelines for the designs of the major arcana, and he hired Smith to do the painting, and to make original artwork for the minor arcana. Waite instructed Smith to not paint actual \"wands\" in the wand cards, but rather to paint large tree trunk staffs with some foliage growing on them, so as to make an association between wands and Eliphas Levi's phrase \"the flowering rod of Aaron\" from Levi's fake fragment of the Key of Solomon.\n\nThe earliest magical rod in European literary canon appears in the \"Odyssey\": the \"rhabdos\" (ῥάβδος, meaning 'rod') of Circe, who uses it to transform Odysseus's men into pigs. Italian fairy tales put them into the hands of the powerful fairies by the late Middle Ages. \n\nIn the 1700s ballads \"Allison Gross\" and \"The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea\", the villainesses use silver wands to transform their victims into animals, in emulation of the Odyssey that preceded them. In C. S. Lewis's 1950 novel \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", the White Witch's most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. This, again, employs the Odysseyan motif of an evil female witch who uses a magic wand to maliciously transform her victims.\n\nIn the mid 1900s, the MGM and Disney media companies popularized magic wands via four movies, in which wands were wielded by benevolent female fairy characters. Those movies were The Wizard of Oz (1939; MGM; a wand-staff was wielded by Glinda the Good Witch of the North), Pinocchio (1940; Disney; a wand was wielded by \"the blue fairy\"), Cinderella (1950; Disney; a wand was wielded by a \"fairy godmother\"), and Sleeping Beauty (1959; Disney; a wand was wielded by each of three fairies). In The Wizard of Oz and Pinocchio, the fairies' wands are embellished with a star-shaped ornament on the end, whereas in Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, the fairies have wands with traditional plain tips.\n\nMagic wands commonly feature in works of fantasy fiction as spell-casting tools. Few other common denominators exist, so the capabilities of wands vary wildly. In Joanne K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, the first book of which was published in 1997, personal wands are common, as necessary tools to channel out each character's magic, and they are used as weapons in magical duels, and it is the wand that chooses its owner. A wand is also present in the Children of the Red King series in the possession of Charlie Bone as well as the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft where caster classes such as the mage and warlock use wands offensively.\n\n\n\n"}

Barnabas de Reatinis of Reggio notes in his \"Compendium de naturis et proprietatibus alimentorum\" (1338) that the Tuscan \"vermicelli\" are called \"orati\" in Bologna, \"minutelli\" in Venice, \"fermentini\" in Reggio, and \"pancardelle\" in Mantua.\n\nThe first mention of a vermicelli recipe is in the book \"De arte Coquinaria per vermicelli e maccaroni siciliani\" (\"The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli\"), compiled by the famous Maestro Martino da Como, unequalled in his field at the time and perhaps the first \"celebrity chef,\" who was the chef at the Roman palazzo of the papal chamberlain (\"camerlengo\"), the Patriarch of Aquileia. In Martino's \"Libro de arte coquinaria\", there are several recipes for vermicelli, which can last two or three years (\"doi o tre anni\") when dried in the sun.\n\nIn English, the Italian loanword \"vermicelli\" is used to indicate different sorts of long pasta shapes from different parts of the world but mostly from South or East Asia.\n\nIn countries of the Indian Subcontinent, vermicelli is known by various local names such as, \"\"Sevai\"\" in Tamil and Malayalam]], \"shavige\" in Kannada, \"sevalu\" or \"semiya\" in Telugu, \"semiya\" in Tamil and Malayalam \"shemai\" in Bengali, \"seviyan\" in Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi, vaLavaT/shevaya in Marathi, \"simei\" in Odia, \"sev\" in Gujarati. The noodles are used in a number of dishes including a variation of \"kheer\", a sweet dessert similar to rice pudding. Vermicelli are also used in many parts of India to make a popular dish called \"upma\". To prepare it, dry oil-roasted vermicelli are boiled with a choice of vegetables.\n\nCentral Asian \"Kesme\" and Persian \"reshteh\" also resembles vermicelli. \"Fālūde\" or \"faloodeh\" is a Persian frozen dessert made with thin vermicelli noodles frozen with corn starch, rose water, lime juice, and often ground pistachios.\n\nIn East Asia, the term rice vermicelli is often used to describe the thin rice noodles (米粉) popular in China, also known as \"bee hoon\" in Hokkien Chinese, mai fun in Cantonese Chinese, วุ้นเส้น (Wûns̄ên) in Thai, (\"kya zan\") in Burmese, and \"bún\" in Vietnamese. The term \"vermicelli\" may also refer to vermicelli made from mung bean, which is translucent when cooked, whereas rice vermicelli turns whitish when cooked. Mung bean vermicelli is commonly used in Chinese cuisine. In contrast, misua () is vermicelli that is made of wheat instead of rice. While superficially similar to \"bee hoon\" it has a very different texture and different culinary uses as well.\n\nThe \"fideo\" is a type of noodle, produced in Europe ever since the Roman times and best known as \"fideus\" or \"fidelis\", then spread to Mexican and Latin American cuisine, often referred to by speakers of English as \"vermicelli.\" It is commonly used in chicken soup and in \"sopa seca\", a type of side-dish.\n\nVermicelli, called \"she'reya\" (شعريه) in Arabic, is used in one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Egypt. The vermicelli is browned by frying with oil or butter, then rice and water are added.\n\nIn Somalia, it is used in a sweet dish called \"cadriyad\", originating from the Yemeni \"^aTriyah\" (عطرية). The vermicelli is browned by frying with butter, then water, sugar and cardamom are added until it has softened slightly. The dish is similar to the Indian \"kheer\". However, no milk or cream is added. It is usually eaten as a dessert or as a side-dish with Somali spiced rice dishes.\n\n\"Cadriyad\" is also a common dessert in certain parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Arab-influenced Harar-ghe region, where it is known as \"attriya\" and is served cold, often with a thin layer of custard on top.\n\n"}

In the Muslim regions where it is present, meze is often served as a part of multi-course meals, while in Greece and the Balkans they function more as snacks while drinking or talking.\n\nThe word is found in all the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire and comes from Persian (' \"taste, snack\" < ' \"to taste\").\n\nIn Turkey, meze often consist of \"beyaz peynir\" (literally \"white cheese\"), \"kavun\" (sliced ripe melon), \"acılı ezme\" (hot pepper paste often with walnuts), \"haydari\" (thick strained yogurt with herbs), \"patlıcan salatası\" (cold eggplant salad), \"beyin salatası\" (brain salad), \"kalamar tava\" (fried calamari or squid), midye dolma and \"midye tava\" (stuffed or fried mussels), enginar (artichokes), \"cacık\" (yogurt with cucumber and garlic), \"pilaki\" (foods cooked in a special sauce), \"dolma\" or \"sarma\" (rice-stuffed vine leaves or other stuffed vegetables, such as bell peppers), arnavut ciğeri (a liver dish, served cold), octopus salad, and \"çiğ köfte\" (raw meatballs with bulgur).\n\nIn Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans, \"mezé\", \"mezés\", or \"mezédhes\" (plural) are small dishes, hot or cold, spicy or savory. Seafood dishes such as grilled octopus may be included, along with salads, sliced hard-boiled eggs, garlic bread, kalamata olives, fava beans, fried vegetables, melitzanosalata (eggplant salad), taramosalata, fried or grilled cheeses called saganaki, and sheep, goat, or cow cheeses. \n\nPopular meze dishes include:\n\nIn Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus, meze is often a meal in its own right. There are vegetarian, meat or fish mezes. Groups of dishes arrive at the table about 4 or 5 at a time (usually between five and ten groups). There is a set pattern to the dishes: typically olives, tahini, salad and yogurt will be followed by dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as whole fish or meat stews and grills. Establishments will offer their own specialities, but the pattern remains the same. Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons. For example, in late autumn, snails will be prominent. As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease. Eating a Cypriot meze is a social event.\n\nIn the Balkans, meze is very similar to Mediterranean antipasti in the sense that cured cold-cuts, cheese and salads are dominant ingredients and that it typically doesn't include cooked meals. In Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro it includes hard or creamy cheeses, kajmak (clotted cream) or smetana cream, salami, ham and other forms of \"suho/suvo meso\" (cured pork or beef), kulen (paprika flavoured, cured sausage), cured bacon, ajvar, and various pastry; In Bosnia and Herzegovina, depending on religious food restrictions one obeys, meze excludes pork products and replaces them with sudžuk (dry, spicy sausage) and pastrami-like cured beef. In southern Croatia, Herzegovina and Montenegro more mediterranean forms of cured meat like pršut and panceta and regional products like olives are common. Albanian-style meze platters typically include prosciutto ham, salami and brined cheese, accompanied with roasted bell peppers (\"capsicum\") or green olives marinated in olive oil with garlic. In Bulgaria, popular mezes are lukanka (a spicy sausage), soujouk (a dry and spicy sausage), sirene (a white brine cheese), and Shopska salad made with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, roasted peppers and sirene. In Romania, mezelic means quick appetizer and includes Zacuscă, cheeses and salamis, often accompanied by Țuică.\n\n\"Meze\" is generally accompanied by the distilled drinks rakı, arak (Syria), ouzo, Aragh Sagi, rakia, mastika, or tsipouro. It may also be consumed with beer, wine and other alcoholic drinks. Cyprus Brandy (served neat) is a favourite drink to accompany \"meze\" in Cyprus, although lager or wine are popular with some.\n\nThe same dishes, served without alcoholic drinks, are termed \"muqabbilat\" (starters) in Arabic.\n\nIn Bulgaria, meze is served primarily at the consumption of wine, rakia and mastika, but also accompanying other alcoholic drinks that are not local to the region. In addition to traditional local foods, meze can include nuts, sweets or pre-packaged snacks. The term meze is generally applied to any foods and snacks consumed alongside an alcoholic beverage.\nIn Greece, meze is served in restaurants called \"mezedopoleíon\" and \"tsipourádiko\" or \"ouzerí\", a type of café that serves ouzo or tsipouro. A \"tavérna\" (tavern) or \"estiatório\" (restaurant) offer a mezé as an \"orektikó\" (appetiser). Many restaurants offer their house \"poikilía\" (\"variety\")—a platter with a smorgasbord of mezédhes that can be served immediately to customers looking for a quick or light meal. Hosts commonly serve mezédhes to their guests at informal or impromptu get-togethers, as they are easy to prepare on short notice. \"Krasomezédhes\" (literally \"wine-meze\") is a meze that goes well with wine; \"ouzomezédhes\" are meze that goes with ouzo.\n"}

The digestive was first developed in 1839 by two Scottish doctors to aid digestion. The term \"digestive\" is derived from the belief that they had antacid properties due to the use of sodium bicarbonate when they were first developed. Historically, some producers used diastatic malt extract to \"digest\" some of the starch that existed in flour prior to baking. \n\nFirst manufactured in 1892, McVitie's digestive is the best-selling biscuit in the UK. A prominent feature in British culture, the digestive is ranked the fourth most popular biscuit for \"dunking\" into tea, with the chocolate digestive coming in at number one.\n\nIn 1839, digestives were first developed in the United Kingdom by two Scottish doctors to aid digestion. Digestives featured in advertisements for the Berkshire-based biscuit company Huntley & Palmers in 1876, with a recipe being given in Cassell's \"New Universal Cookery Book\" of 1894. In 1851 an issue of The Lancet London's advertising section offered \"brown meal\" digestive biscuits. At the time, it was asserted grain millers knew only of bran and endosperm. After 10% of the whole grain's coarser outer-bran coat was removed, and because the innermost 70% of pure endosperm was reserved for other uses, brown meal, representing only 20% of the whole grain, remained, consisting of about 15% fine bran and 85% white flour. By 1912 it was more widely known that brown meal included the germ, which lent a characteristic sweetness.\n\nIn 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application, which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. The U.S. patent, titled \"Making Malted Bread\", included instructions for the manufacture of digestive biscuits. Montgomerie claimed this saccharification process would make \"nourishing food for people of weak digestion\".\n\nDespite rumours that it is illegal for them to be sold under their usual name in the United States, they are, in fact, widely available in imported food sections of grocery stores and by mail order.\n\nThe typical digestive biscuit contains coarse brown wheat flour (which gives it its distinctive texture and flavour), sugar, malt extract, vegetable oil, wholemeal, raising agents (usually sodium bicarbonate, tartaric acid and malic acid) and salt. Dried whey, oatmeal, cultured skimmed milk and emulsifiers such as DATEM may also be added in some varieties.\n\nA digestive biscuit averages around 70 calories, although this sometimes varies according to the factors involved in its production.\n\nDigestive biscuits are frequently eaten with tea or coffee. Sometimes, the biscuit is dunked into the tea and eaten quickly due to the biscuit's tendency to disintegrate when wet. Digestive biscuits are one of the top 10 biscuits in the United Kingdom for dunking in tea. The digestive biscuit is also used as a cracker with cheeses, and is often included in \"cracker selection\" packets.\n\nIn the UK, McVitie's digestive is the best selling biscuit, with 80 million packs sold annually. Digestives are also popular in food preparation for making into bases for cheesecakes and similar desserts.\n\nDigestive biscuits are also available, coated on the underside with milk, dark or white chocolate. Originally produced by McVitie's in 1925 in the UK as the Chocolate Homewheat Digestive, other varieties include the basic biscuit with chocolate shavings throughout (chocolate \"chips\" in the biscuit mix), or a layer of caramel, mint chocolate, orange-flavoured chocolate, or plain chocolate. American travel writer Bill Bryson described the chocolate digestive as \"a British masterpiece\". The McVitie's chocolate digestive is the most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea.\n\nMcVitie's digestive biscuits have become known among fans of the rock group The Beatles because they were the cause of an argument between George Harrison and John Lennon during a recording session for the group's 1969 album \"Abbey Road\". The incident was recounted by recording engineer Geoff Emerick in his book \"Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles\". According to Emerick, Lennon's wife Yoko Ono was in the recording studio and at one point helped herself to Harrison's box of McVitie's while the Beatles were in the control room listening to a playback of the song they'd just recorded. Harrison got angry at Ono, and his subsequent outburst caused Lennon to lose his temper in response.\n\nChocolate digestives were the technical challenge to the bakers in . They were also the technical challenge to the bakers in .\n\n\n"}

Fractionating columns are used in small scale laboratory distillations as well as for large scale industrial distillations.\n\nA laboratory fractionating column is a piece of glassware used to separate vaporized mixtures of liquid compounds with close volatility. It can also be called a fractional column. Most commonly used is either a Vigreux column or a straight column packed with glass beads or metal pieces such as Raschig rings. Fractionating columns help to separate the mixture by helping the mixed vapors to cool, condense, and vaporize again in accordance with Raoult's law. With each condensation-vaporization cycle, the vapors are enriched in a certain component. A larger surface area allows more cycles, improving separation. This is the rationale for a Vigreux column or a packed fractionating column. Spinning band distillation achieves the same outcome by using a rotating band within the column to force the rising vapors and descending condensate into close contact, achieving equilibrium more quickly.\n\nIn a typical fractional distillation, a liquid mixture is heated in the distilling flask, and the resulting vapor rises up the fractionating column (see Figure 1). The vapor condenses on glass spurs (known as trays or plates) inside the column, and returns to the distilling flask, refluxing the rising distillate vapor. The hottest tray is at the bottom of the column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray reach an equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gas form all the way to the top, where it may then proceed through a condenser, which cools the vapor until it condenses into a liquid distillate. The separation may be enhanced by the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.).\n\nFractional distillation is one of the unit operations of chemical engineering. Fractionating columns are widely used in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the petroleum processing, petrochemical production, natural gas processing, coal tar processing, brewing, liquified air separation, and hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a complex, multicomponent mixture that must be separated, and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, also called \"fractions\". That is the origin of the name \"fractional distillation\" or \"fractionation\". It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.\n\nDistillation is one of the most common and energy-intensive separation processes. Effectiveness of separation is dependent upon the height and diameter of the column, the ratio of the column's height to diameter, and the material that comprises the distillation column itself. In a typical chemical plant, it accounts for about 40% of the total energy consumption. Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns (as shown in Figure 2) known as \"distillation towers\" or \"distillation columns\" with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.\n\nIndustrial distillation towers are usually operated at a continuous steady state. Unless disturbed by changes in feed, heat, ambient temperature, or condensing, the amount of feed being added normally equals the amount of product being removed.\n\nThe amount of heat entering the column from the reboiler and with the feed must equal the amount heat removed by the overhead condenser and with the products. The heat entering a distillation column is a crucial operating parameter, addition of excess or insufficient heat to the column can lead to foaming, weeping, entrainment, or flooding.\n\nFigure 3 depicts an industrial fractionating column separating a feed stream into one distillate fraction and one bottoms fraction. However, many industrial fractionating columns have outlets at intervals up the column so that multiple products having different boiling ranges may be withdrawn from a column distilling a multi-component feed stream. The \"lightest\" products with the lowest boiling points exit from the top of the columns and the \"heaviest\" products with the highest boiling points exit from the bottom.\n\nIndustrial fractionating columns use external reflux to achieve better separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product that returns to the upper part of the fractionating column as shown in Figure 3.\n\nInside the column, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux and/or more trays provided, the better is the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials.\n\nThe design and operation of a fractionating column depends on the composition of the feed and as well as the composition of the desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation can be used. For a multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design, operation, and construction.\n\nBubble-cap \"trays\" or \"plates\" are one of the types of physical devices, which are used to provide good contact between the upflowing vapor and the downflowing liquid inside an industrial fractionating column. Such trays are shown in Figures 4 and 5.\n\nThe efficiency of a tray or plate is typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient equilibrium stage. Hence, a fractionating column almost always needs more actual, physical plates than the required number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. \n\nIn industrial uses, sometimes a packing material is used in the column instead of trays, especially when low pressure drops across the column are required, as when operating under vacuum. This packing material can either be random dumped packing ( wide) such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing, and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "353085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353085", "title": "While", "text": "While\n\n\"While\" is a word in the English language that functions both as a noun and as a subordinating conjunction. Its meaning varies largely based on its intended function, position in the phrase and even the writer or speaker's regional dialect. As a conjunction, it is synonymous with the word \"whilst\", a form often considered archaic in American English, as well as in some style guides on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\"A while\" and \"awhile\" are often confused due to the fact that \"while\" is often accompanied by the indefinite article. The main difference is that \"a while\" means \"an amount of time\" or \"some duration\" whereas \"awhile\" is an adverb meaning \"\"for\" some amount of time\" or \"\"for\" some duration\".\n\nBoth of these sentences yield the same effective meaning. \"Whilst\" is only a conjunction, and so its use here would be incorrect.\n\nThe primary function of the word as a conjunction is to indicate that two separate clauses occur at the same time.\n\n\"While\" can also be legitimately used in the contrastive sense, comparable to the words \"although\" or \"whereas\", provided that it is not ambiguous (although some commentators, such as Eric Partridge, have disapproved of such use):\n\nThe latter sentence can mean either \"during the time that Sally plays, Sue works\" or \"although Sally plays, Sue works\" and is thus ambiguous.\n\n\"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" disapproves of several uses of the conjunctive \"while\". At times it is inappropriately used as a coordinating conjunction: \"and\" or \"but\" should be used instead. Its usage as \"elegant variation\" is also discouraged, as it is masquerading as a \"formal word\".\n\nIn some dialects of Northern England, \"while\" is translated into standard English as \"until\"; for example, \"At least wait while we're done.\"\n\nIn standard British English and Australian English, \"whilst\", as a conjunction, is synonymous with \"although\", \"whereas\", \"but\" or \"while\". Unlike \"whilst\", \"while\" is also used as a noun (as in \"rest for a while\") or a verb (as in \"while away the hours\").\n\nThe usage of \"whilst\" is chiefly British. For example, the BBC World Service website \"Learning English\", in their \"Ask about English\" section, uses the word \"whilst\" when explaining the usage of \"while and whereas\".\n\nIn American English, \"whilst\" is considered to be pretentious or archaic.\n\nSome publications on both sides of the Atlantic disapprove of \"whilst\" in their style guides (along with \"amidst\" and \"amongst\"); for example:\n\nThe American Heritage Guide writes that, \"while using \"whilst\" runs the risk of sounding pretentious, it can sometimes add a literary or ironically formal note to a piece of writing\".\n\n\"Practical English Usage\" by Michael Swan (OUP), a reference book for intermediate and advanced learners of English, does not include \"whilst\" but has several sections covering the usage of \"while\".\n\n"}

This doughnut or fritter is usually topped with powdered sugar, and may be filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream, or a butter-and-honey mixture. The consistency ranges from light and puffy, to bread- or pasta-like. It is eaten to celebrate Saint Joseph's Day, which is a Catholic feast day.\n\nZeppole are typical of Italian cuisine, especially that of Rome and Naples. They are also served in Sicily, Sardinia, on the island of Malta, and in Italian-Canadian and Italian-American communities in Canada and the United States. Zeppole are known by other names, including Bignè di San Giuseppe (in Rome), St. Joseph's Day cake, and sfinge. \"Zeppole\" are traditionally consumed during the \"Festa di San Giuseppe\" (Saint Joseph's Day) celebrated every March 19, when zeppole are sold on many streets and sometimes presented as gifts.\n\nIn Istria, Croatia this pastry is called blenzi in the Croatian speaking places and zeppole in the Italian-speaking places.They are always topped with sugar either powdered or coarse.\n\nThe custom was popularized in the early 19th century by Neapolitan baker Pasquale Pintauro.\n\nThe terms \"zeppole\" and \"sfinge\" are also used to refer to baked cream puffs made from choux pastry.\n\nSome \"zeppole\" are filled with ricotta mixed with small pieces of chocolate, candied fruits and honey. In some parts of the U.S., they are called \"crispelli\"s.\n\n\"Zeppole\" can also be savory, and consist of fried bread dough often filled with anchovy.

Mud brick was a primary building material in ancient Egypt. This material is composed of ancient mud mixed with the nitrous \ncompost of the hay and stubble that the bricks were originally formulated with to give added strength before being baked in the sun.\n\nA common practice in Egypt, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was for farmers to obtain government permits to remove this material from ancient mounds; such farmers were known as 'sebakhin'. Mounds indicating the location of ancient cities are also known as a \"tell\", or \"tel\".\n\nAn archaeological site could provide an excellent source of sebakh because decomposed organic debris creates a soil very rich in nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential component in fertilizers used for plant crops.\n\nNumerous potentially valuable archaeological finds were unfortunately destroyed by farmers in this way.

{"id": "355129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355129", "title": "New Coke", "text": "New Coke\n\nNew Coke was the unofficial name for the reformulation of Coca-Cola introduced in April 1985 by the Coca-Cola Company to replace the original formula of its flagship soft drink Coca-Cola, or Coke. In 1992, it was named Coke II.\n\nBy 1985, Coca-Cola had been losing market share to diet soft drinks and non-cola beverages for many years. Consumers who were purchasing regular colas seemed to prefer the sweeter taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste tests. However, the American public's reaction to the change was negative, even hostile, and the \"New Coke\" was considered a major failure. The company reintroduced Coke's original formula within three months of New Coke's debut, rebranded as \"Coca-Cola Classic\", and this resulted in a significant gain in sales. This led to speculation by some that the introduction of the New Coke formula was just a marketing ploy to stimulate sales of original Coca-Cola; however, the company has maintained that it was a genuine attempt to replace the original product.\n\nCoke II was discontinued in July 2002. It remains influential as a cautionary tale against tampering with a well-established and successful brand.\n\nAfter World War II, the market share for Coca-Cola was 60%. By 1983, it had declined to under 24%, largely because of competition from Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi had begun to outsell Coke in supermarkets; Coke maintained its edge only through soda vending machines and fountain sales in fast food restaurants, concessions, and sports venues where Coca-Cola had purchased \"pouring rights\".\n\nMarket analysts believed baby boomers were more likely to purchase diet drinks as they aged and remained health- and weight-conscious. Growth in the full-calorie segment would have to come from younger drinkers, who at that time favored Pepsi by even more overwhelming margins than the market as a whole. Meanwhile, the overall market for colas steadily declined in the early 1980s, as consumers increasingly purchased diet and non-cola soft drinks, many of which were sold by Coca-Cola themselves. This trend further eroded Coca-Cola's market share. When Roberto Goizueta became Coca-Cola CEO in 1980, he pointedly told employees there would be no \"sacred cows\" in how the company did business, including how it formulated its drinks.\n\nCoca-Cola's senior executives commissioned a secret project headed by marketing vice president Sergio Zyman and Coca-Cola USA president Brian Dyson to create a new flavor for Coke. The effort, Project Kansas, took its name from a photo of Kansas journalist William Allen White drinking a Coke; the image had been used extensively in Coca-Cola advertising and hung on several executives' walls.\n\nThe sweeter cola overwhelmingly beat both regular Coke and Pepsi in taste tests, surveys, and focus groups. Asked if they would buy and drink the product if it \"were\" Coca-Cola, most testers said they would, although it would take some getting used to. About 10-12% of testers felt angry and alienated at the thought, and said they might stop drinking Coke altogether. Their presence in focus groups tended to negatively skew results as they exerted indirect peer pressure on other participants.\n\nThe surveys, which were given more significance by standard marketing procedures of the era, were less negative than the taste tests and were key in convincing management to change the formula in 1985, to coincide with the drink's centenary. But the focus groups had provided a clue as to how the change would play out in a public context, a data point the company downplayed but which proved important later.\n\nManagement rejected an idea to make and sell the new flavor as a separate variety of Coca-Cola. The company's bottlers were already complaining about absorbing other recent additions into the product line since Diet Coke in 1982; Cherry Coke was launched nationally nearly concurrently with New Coke during 1985. Many of them had sued over the company's syrup pricing policies. A new variety of Coke in competition with the main variety could also have cannibalized Coke's sales and increased the proportion of Pepsi drinkers relative to Coke drinkers.\n\nEarly in his career with Coca-Cola, Goizueta had been in charge of the company's Bahamian subsidiary. In that capacity, he had improved sales by tweaking the drink's flavor slightly, so he was receptive to the idea that changes to the taste of Coke could lead to increased profits. He believed it would be \"New Coke or no Coke\", and that the change must take place openly. He insisted that the containers carry the \"New!\" label, which gave the drink its popular name.\n\nGoizueta also made a visit to his mentor and predecessor as the company's chief executive, the ailing Robert W. Woodruff, who had built Coke into an international brand following World War II. He claimed he had secured Woodruff's blessing for the reformulation, but even many of Goizueta's closest friends within the company doubt that Woodruff understood Goizueta's intentions.\n\nNew Coke was introduced on April 23, 1985. Production of the original formulation ended later that week.\nIn many areas, New Coke was initially introduced in \"old\" Coke packaging; bottlers used up remaining cans, cartons and labels before new packaging was widely available. Old cans containing New Coke were identified by their gold colored tops, while glass and plastic bottles had red caps instead of silver and white, respectively.\n\nThe press conference at New York City's Lincoln Center to introduce the new formula did not go well. Reporters had already been fed questions by Pepsi, which was worried that New Coke would erase its gains. Goizueta, Coca-Cola's CEO, described the new flavor as \"bolder\", \"rounder\", and \"more harmonious\", and defended the change by saying that the drink's secret formula was not sacrosanct and inviolable. As far back as 1935, Coca-Cola sought kosher certification from an Atlanta rabbi and made two changes to the formula so the drink could be considered kosher (as well as halal and vegetarian). Goizueta also refused to admit that taste tests had led the change, calling it \"one of the easiest decisions we've ever made.\" A reporter asked whether Diet Coke would also be reformulated \"assuming [New Coke] is a success,\" to which Goizueta curtly replied, \"No. And I didn't assume that this is a success. This \"is\" a success.\"\n\nThe emphasis on the sweeter taste of the new flavor also ran contrary to previous Coke advertising, in which spokesman Bill Cosby had touted Coke's less-sweet taste as a reason to prefer it over Pepsi. Nevertheless, the company's stock went up on the announcement, and market research showed 80% of the American public was aware of the change within days.\n\nThe company, as it had planned, introduced the new formula with big marketing pushes in New York (workers renovating the Statue of Liberty for its centenary were symbolically the first Americans given cans to take home) and Washington, D.C. (where thousands of free cans were given away in Lafayette Park). As soon as New Coke was introduced, the new formula was available at McDonald's and other drink fountains in the United States. Sales figures from those cities, and other areas where it had been introduced, showed a reaction that went as the market research had predicted. In fact, Coke's sales were up 8% over the same period as the year before.\n\nMost Coke drinkers resumed buying the new Coke at much the same level as they had the old one. Surveys indicated that the majority of regular Coke drinkers liked the new flavoring. Three-quarters of the respondents said they would buy New Coke again. The big test, however, remained in the Southeast, where Coke was first bottled and tasted.\n\nDespite New Coke's acceptance with a large number of Coca-Cola drinkers, many more resented the change in formula and were not shy about making that known — just as had happened in the focus groups. Many of these drinkers were Southerners, some of whom considered Coca-Cola a fundamental part of their regional identity. They viewed the company's decision to change the formula through the prism of the Civil War, as another surrender to the \"Yankees\".\n\nCompany headquarters in Atlanta began receiving letters and telephone calls expressing anger or deep disappointment. The company received over 40,000 calls and letters, including one letter, delivered to Goizueta, that was addressed to \"Chief Dodo, The Coca-Cola Company\". Another letter asked for his autograph, as the signature of \"one of the dumbest executives in American business history\" would likely become valuable in the future. The company hotline, 1-800-GET-COKE, received over 1,500 calls a day compared to around 400 before the change. A psychiatrist whom Coke had hired to listen in on calls told executives that some people sounded as if they were discussing the death of a family member.\n\nThey were, nonetheless, joined by some voices from outside the region. \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Bob Greene wrote some widely reprinted pieces ridiculing the new flavor and damning Coke's executives for having changed it. Comedians and talk show hosts, including Johnny Carson and David Letterman, made regular jokes mocking the switch. Ads for New Coke were booed heavily when they appeared on the scoreboard at the Houston Astrodome. Even Fidel Castro, a longtime Coca-Cola drinker, contributed to the backlash, calling New Coke a sign of American capitalist decadence. Goizueta's father expressed similar misgivings to his son, who later recalled that it was the only time his father had agreed with Castro, whose rule he had fled Cuba to avoid.\n\nGay Mullins, a Seattle retiree looking to start a public relations firm with $120,000 of borrowed money, formed the organization \"Old Cola Drinkers of America\" on May 28 to lobby Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell it to someone else. His organization eventually received over 60,000 phone calls. He also filed a class action lawsuit against the company (which was quickly dismissed by a judge who said he preferred the taste of Pepsi), while nevertheless expressing interest in securing The Coca-Cola Company as a client of his new firm should it reintroduce the old formula. In two informal blind taste tests, Mullins either failed to distinguish New Coke from old or expressed a preference for New Coke.\n\nDespite ongoing resistance in the South, New Coke continued to do well in the rest of the country. But executives were uncertain of how international markets would react. Executives met with international Coke bottlers in Monaco; to their surprise, the bottlers were not interested in selling New Coke. Zyman also heard doubts and skepticism from his relatives in Mexico, where New Coke was scheduled to be introduced later that summer, when he went there on vacation.\n\nGoizueta stated that Coca-Cola employees who liked New Coke felt unable to speak up due to peer pressure, as had happened in the focus groups. Donald Keough, the Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer, reported overhearing someone say at his country club that they liked New Coke, but they would be \"damned if I'll let Coca-Cola know that.\"\n\nPepsi-Cola took advantage of the situation, running ads in which a first-time Pepsi drinker exclaimed, \"Now I know why Coke did it!\" Even amidst consumer anger and several Pepsi ads mocking Coca-Cola's debacle, Pepsi actually gained very few long-term converts over Coke's switch, despite a 14% sales increase over the same month the previous year, the largest sales growth in the company's history. Coca-Cola's director of corporate communications, Carlton Curtis, realized over time that consumers were more upset about the withdrawal of the old formula than the taste of the new one.\n\nRoger Enrico, then director of Pepsi's North American operations, declared a company-wide holiday and took out a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" proclaiming that Pepsi had won the long-running \"Cola Wars\". Since Coke officials were preoccupied over the weekend with preparations for the announcement, their Pepsi counterparts had time to cultivate skepticism among reporters, sounding themes that would later come into play in the public discourse over the changed drink. After the announcement on April 23, PepsiCo gave their employees the day off saying, \"By today's action, Coke has admitted that it's \"not\" the real thing.\"\n\nSome Coca-Cola executives had quietly been arguing for a reintroduction of the old formula as early as May. By mid June, when soft drink sales usually start to rise, the numbers showed that new Coke was leveling among consumers. Executives feared social peer pressure was now affecting their bottom line. Some consumers even began trying to obtain \"old\" Coke from overseas, where the new formula had not yet been introduced, as domestic stocks of the old drink were exhausted. Over the course of the month, Coca-Cola's chemists also quietly reduced the acidity level of the new formula, hoping to assuage complaints about the flavor and allow its sweetness to be better perceived (advertisements pointing to this change were prepared, but never used).\n\nIn addition to the noisier public protests, boycotts, and bottles being emptied into the streets of several cities, the company had more serious reasons to be concerned. Its bottlers, and not just the ones still suing the company over syrup pricing policies, were expressing concern. While they had given Goizueta a standing ovation when he announced the change at an April 22 bottlers' meeting at Atlanta's Woodruff Arts Center, glad the company had finally taken some initiative in the face of Pepsi's advances, they were less enthusiastic about the taste. Most of them saw great difficulty having to promote and sell a drink that had long been marketed as \"The Real Thing\", constant and unchanging, now that it had been changed.\n\nThe 20 bottlers still suing Coca-Cola made much of the change in their legal arguments. Coca-Cola had argued in its defense when the suit was originally filed that the formula's uniqueness and difference from Diet Coke justified different pricing policies from the latter – but if the new formula was simply an HFCS-sweetened Diet Coke, Coca-Cola could not argue the formula was unique. Bottlers, particularly in the South, were also tired of facing personal opprobrium over the change. Many reported that some acquaintances and even friends and relatives had ostracized them, or had expressed displeasure in other emotionally hurtful ways. On June 23, several of the bottlers took these complaints to Coca-Cola executives in a private meeting. With the company now fearing boycotts not only from its consumers but its bottlers, talks about reintroducing the old formula moved from \"if\" to \"when\".\n\nFinally, the Coca-Cola board decided that enough was enough, and plans were set in motion to bring back the old Coke. Company president Donald Keough revealed years later, in the documentary \"The People vs. Coke\" (2002), that they realized this was the only right thing to do when they visited a small restaurant in Monaco and the owner of the restaurant proudly said they had \"the real thing, it's a real Coke,\" offering them a chilled 6 and 1/2 oz. glass bottle of original Coca-Cola.\n\nCoca-Cola executives announced the return of the original formula during the afternoon of July 11, 78 days after New Coke's introduction. ABC News' Peter Jennings interrupted \"General Hospital\" with a special bulletin to share the news with viewers. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, David Pryor called the reintroduction \"a meaningful moment in U.S. history\". The company hotline received 31,600 calls in the two days after the announcement.\n\nThe new product continued to be sold and retained the name \"Coca-Cola\" (until 1992, when it was renamed \"Coke II\"), so the original formula was renamed \"Coca-Cola Classic\", and for a short time it was referred to by the public as \"Old Coke\". Some who tasted the reintroduced formula were not convinced that the first batches really were the same formula that had supposedly been retired that spring. This was true for a few regions, because Coca-Cola Classic differed from the original formula in that all bottlers who hadn't already done so were using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar to sweeten the drink, though most had by this time.\n\n\"There is a twist to this story which will please every humanist and will probably keep Harvard professors puzzled for years,\" said Keough at a press conference. \"The simple fact is that all the time and money and skill poured into consumer research on the new Coca-Cola could not measure or reveal the deep and abiding emotional attachment to original Coca-Cola felt by so many people.\"\n\nGay Mullins, founder of the organization \"Old Cola Drinkers of America\" (which had lobbied Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell it to someone else), was given the first case of Coca-Cola Classic.\n\nBy the end of 1985, Coca-Cola Classic was substantially outselling both New Coke and Pepsi. Six months after the rollout, Coke's sales had increased at more than twice the rate of Pepsi's.\n\nNew Coke's sales dwindled to a three percent share of the market, although it was selling quite well in Los Angeles and some other key markets. Later research, however, suggested that it was not the return of Coca-Cola Classic, but instead the nearly unnoticed introduction of Cherry Coke, which appeared almost simultaneously with New Coke, that can be credited with the company's success in 1985.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out where it had made a mistake, ultimately concluding that it had underestimated the public reaction of the portion of the customer base that would be alienated by the switch. This would not emerge for several years afterward, however, and in the meantime the public simply concluded that the company had, as Keough suggested, failed to consider the public's attachment to the idea of what Coke's old formula represented. While that has become conventional wisdom in the ensuing years, some analyses have suggested otherwise.\n\nThis populist version of the story served Coke's interests, however, as the episode did more to position and define Coca-Cola as a brand embodying values distinct from Pepsi than any deliberate effort to do so probably could have done. Allowing itself to be portrayed as a somewhat clueless large corporation forced to withdraw from a big change by overwhelming public pressure flattered customers, as Keough put it, \"We love any retreat which has us rushing toward our best customers with the product they love the most.\" Bottles and cans continued to bear the \"Coca-Cola Classic\" title until January 2009, when the company announced it would stop printing the word \"Classic\" on the labels of bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States. The change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image.\n\nThe fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his long time advertising for Coca-Cola. Cosby claimed that his commercials praising the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility. No one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, for the simple reason that it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time, Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Zyman summed up the New Coke experience thus:\nNew Coke continued to do what it had originally been designed to do: win taste tests. In 1987, \"The Wall Street Journal\" surveyed 100 randomly selected cola drinkers, the majority of whom indicated a preference for Pepsi, with Classic Coke accounting for the remainder save two New Coke loyalists. When this group was given a chance to try all three in a blind test, New Coke slightly edged out Pepsi, but many drinkers reacted angrily to finding they had chosen a brand other than their favorite.\n\nGoizueta claimed that he never once regretted the decision to change Coca-Cola. He even threw a tenth anniversary party for New Coke in 1995 and continued to drink it until his death in 1997.\n\nIn the short run, the reintroduction of original Coca-Cola saved Coke's sales figures and brought it back in the good graces of many customers and bottlers. Phone calls and letters to the company were as joyful and thankful as they had been angry and depressed. \"You would have thought we'd cured cancer\", said one executive.\n\nBut confusion reigned at the company's marketing department, which had to design a plan to market two Coca-Colas where such plans were inconceivable just a few months before. Coca-Cola Classic did not need much help, with a \"Red, White and You\" campaign showcasing the American virtues many of those who had clamored for its reintroduction had pointedly reminded the company that it embodied. But the company was at a loss to sell what was now just \"Coke\". Obviously, \"The Best Just Got Better\" could no longer be used. Marketers fumbled for a strategy for the rest of the year. Matters were not helped when McDonald's announced shortly after the reintroduction of Coca-Cola Classic, that it was immediately switching from New Coke back to original Coca-Cola at all of its restaurants.\nAt the beginning of 1986, however, Coke's marketing team found a strategy by returning to one of their original motives for changing the formula: the youth market that preferred Pepsi. Max Headroom, the purportedly computer-generated media personality played by Matt Frewer, was chosen to replace Cosby as the spokesman for Coke's new \"Catch the Wave\" campaign. With his slicked-back hair and sunglasses, he was already known to much of the U.S. youth audience through appearances on MTV and Cinemax. The campaign was launched with a television commercial produced by McCann Erickson New York, with Max saying in his trademark stutter, \"C-c-c-catch the wave!\" and referring to his fellow \"Cokeologists\". In a riposte to Pepsi's televisual teasings, one showed Headroom asking a Pepsi can he was \"interviewing\" how it felt about more drinkers preferring Coke to it and then cut to the condensation forming on, and running down, the can. \"S-s-s-s-sweating?\", he asked.\n\nThe campaign was a huge success, and surveys likewise showed that more than three-quarters of the target market were aware of the ads within two days. Coke's consumer hotline received more calls about Max than any previous spokesperson, some even asking if he had a girlfriend. The ads and campaign continued through 1987, and were chosen as best of 1986 by Video Storyboard of New York.\n\nIn 1985, New Coke was sold only in the United States, United States territories, and Canada while the original formula continued to be sold in the rest of the world. New Coke was eventually returned to the company's product portfolio; it was test-marketed in certain U.S. cities under the name Coke II in 1990, which was taken national in late 1992, despite the company's original intention not to create a second brand. Filmmaker Miranda July is said to have suggested the name of Coke II while working as a tastemaker for an ad agency.\n\nStrangely, the Coca-Cola company did practically nothing to promote or otherwise distinguish it. In a market already offering several choices of drinks calling themselves \"Coke\" in some fashion or another, the public saw little reason to embrace a product they had firmly rejected seven years earlier, and within about a year, Coke II was largely off the American shelves again. By 1998, it could only be found in a few scattered markets in the northwest, midwest and some overseas territories. In July 2002, Coca-Cola announced that Coke II would be discontinued entirely.\n\nOn August 16, 2002, Coca-Cola announced a change of the label in which the word \"Classic\" was no longer so prominent, leading to speculation that it would eventually be removed and the last traces of New Coke eliminated. In 2009, Coca-Cola permanently removed \"Classic\" from its North American packaging.\n\nNew Coke had the spotlight for only three months in 1985, but it casts a long shadow, in both the business world and popular culture that can still be seen. It is most frequently mentioned as a cautionary tale among businesses against tampering too extensively with a well-established and successful brand.\n\n\"For a product so widely despised,\" noted \"AdWeek\" blogger Tim Nudd in 2006, more than two decades later, \"New Coke (a.k.a. Coke II) still gets an admirable amount of ink.\" He noted \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" (2005) by Malcolm Gladwell, and \"Why Most Things Fail: Evolution, Extinction and Economics\" (2005) by Paul Ormerod, that dealt with it at some length, as well as two recent mentions in \"Forbes\" and \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nWithin Coca-Cola, the role the company's bottlers had played in forcing its hand led executives to create a new subsidiary, Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bought out several of the larger bottlers and placed distribution and marketing efforts more tightly under Coca-Cola's control.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company's apparently sudden reversal on New Coke led to several rumors and conspiracy theories that have circulated in the years since to explain how a company with the resources and experience of Coca-Cola could have made such an obvious and colossal blunder.\n\nSome explanations that have been proffered are:\n\nIn his book \"\" (2005), Malcolm Gladwell relates his conversations with market researchers in the food industry who put most of the blame for the failure of New Coke on the flawed nature of taste tests. They claim most are subject to systematic biases. Tests such as the Pepsi Challenge were \"sip tests\", meaning that drinkers were given small samples (less than a can or bottle's worth) to try. Gladwell contends that what people say they like in these tests may not reflect what they actually buy to drink at home over several days. Carol Dollard, who once worked in product development for Pepsi, told Gladwell: \"I've seen many times where the sip test will give you one result and the home-use test will give you the exact opposite.\" For example, although many consumers react positively to the sweeter taste of Pepsi in small volumes, it may become unattractively sweet when drunk in quantity. Coke, on the other hand, may be more attractive for drinking in volume, because it is less sweet. A more comprehensive testing regimen could possibly have revealed this, Gladwell's sources believe.\n\nGladwell reports that other market researchers have criticized Coke for not realizing that much of its success as a brand came from what they call sensation transference, a phenomenon first described by marketer Louis Cheskin in the late 1940s: tasters unconsciously add their reactions to the drink's packaging into their assessment of the taste. For example, one of the researchers told Gladwell that his firm's research had found 7-Up drinkers believe a sample from a bottle with a more yellow label is more \"lemony\", although the flavor was identical.\n\nIn Coke's case, it is alleged that buyers, subject to sensation transference, were also \"tasting\" the red color of the container and distinctive Coca-Cola script. It was therefore, in their opinion, a mistake to focus solely on the product and its taste. \"The mistake Coke made,\" said Darrel Rhea, an executive with the firm Cheskin founded, \"was in attributing their loss in share entirely to the product.\" He points to Pepsi's work in establishing a youth-oriented brand identity from the 1960s as having more bearing on its success.\n\nCoke considered but rejected gradually changing the drink's flavor incrementally, without announcing they were doing so. Executives feared the public would notice and exaggerate slight differences in taste. In 1998, Joel Dubow, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's University, tested this \"flavor balance hypothesis\" and argued that it was not true. He and fellow researcher Nancy Childs tested mixtures of Coca-Cola Classic and Coke II and found that the gradual changes of taste were not noticed by a significant number of tasters. Coke, he said, would have succeeded had it chosen this strategy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "355323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355323", "title": "Cheesesteak", "text": "Cheesesteak\n\nA cheesesteak (also known as a Philadelphia cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak, cheesesteak sandwich, cheese steak, or steak and cheese) is a sandwich made from thinly sliced pieces of beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll. A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.\n\nThe cheesesteak was developed in the early 20th century \"by combining frizzled beef, onions, and cheese in a small loaf of bread\", according to a 1987 exhibition catalog published by the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nPhiladelphians Pat and Harry Olivieri are often credited with inventing the sandwich by serving chopped steak on an Italian roll in the early 1930s. The exact story behind its creation is debated, but in some accounts, Pat and Harry Olivieri originally owned a hot dog stand, and on one occasion, decided to make a new sandwich using chopped beef and grilled onions. While Pat was eating the sandwich, a cab driver stopped by and was interested in it, so he requested one for himself. After eating it, the cab driver suggested that Olivieri quit making hot dogs and instead focus on the new sandwich. They began selling this variation of steak sandwiches at their hot dog stand near South Philadelphia's Italian Market. They became so popular that Pat opened up his own restaurant which still operates today as Pat's King of Steaks. The sandwich was originally prepared without cheese; Olivieri said provolone cheese was first added by Joe \"Cocky Joe\" Lorenza, a manager at the Ridge Avenue location.\n\nCheesesteaks have become popular at restaurants and food carts throughout the city with many locations being independently owned, family-run businesses. Variations of cheesesteaks are now common in several fast food chains. Versions of the sandwich can also be found at high-end restaurants. Many establishments outside of Philadelphia refer to the sandwich as a \"Philly cheesesteak.\"\n\nThe meat traditionally used is thinly sliced rib-eye or top round, although other cuts of beef are also used. On a lightly oiled griddle at medium temperature, the steak slices are quickly browned and then scrambled into smaller pieces with a flat spatula. Slices of cheese are then placed over the meat, letting it melt, and then the roll is placed on top of the cheese. The mixture is then scooped up with a spatula and pressed into the roll, which is then cut in half.\n\nCommon additions include sautéed onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, ketchup, hot sauce, salt, and pepper.\n\nIn Philadelphia, most cheesesteak places use Amoroso rolls; these rolls are long, soft, and slightly salted. One source writes that \"a proper cheesesteak consists of provolone or Cheez Whiz slathered on an Amoroso roll and stuffed with thinly shaved grilled meat,\" while a reader's letter to an Indianapolis magazine, lamenting the unavailability of good cheesesteaks, wrote that \"the mention of the Amoroso roll brought tears to my eyes.\" After commenting on the debates over types of cheese and \"chopped steak or sliced,\" \"Risk and Insurance\" magazine declared \"The only thing nearly everybody can agree on is that it all has to be piled onto a fresh, locally baked Amoroso roll.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Cream Cheese, American cheese, Cheez Whiz, and provolone are the most commonly used cheeses or cheese products put on to the Philly cheesesteak.\n\nWhite American cheese, along with provolone cheese, are the favorites due to their mild flavor and medium consistency. Some establishments melt the American cheese to achieve the creamy consistency, while others place slices over the meat, letting them melt slightly under the heat. \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" restaurant critic Craig LaBan says \"Provolone is for aficionados, extra-sharp for the most discriminating among them.\" Geno's owner, Joey Vento, said, \"We always recommend the provolone. That's the real cheese.\"\n\nCheez Whiz, first marketed in 1952, was not yet available for the original 1930 version, but has spread in popularity. A 1986 \"New York Times\" article called Cheez Whiz \"the \"sine qua non\" of cheesesteak connoisseurs.\" In a 1985 interview, Pat Olivieri's nephew Frank Olivieri said that he uses \"the processed cheese spread familiar to millions of parents who prize speed and ease in fixing the children's lunch for the same reason, because it is fast.\" Cheez Whiz is \"overwhelmingly the favorite\" at Pat's, outselling runner-up American by a ratio of eight or ten to one, while Geno's claims to go through eight to ten cases of Cheez Whiz a day.\n\nIn 2003, while running for President of the United States, John Kerry made what was considered a major faux pas when campaigning in Philadelphia and went to \"Pat's King of Steaks\" and ordered a cheesesteak with Swiss.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358540", "title": "Jambalaya", "text": "Jambalaya\n\nJambalaya ( , ) is a popular Louisiana-origin dish of Spanish, West African and French (especially Provençal cuisine) influence, consisting mainly of meat and vegetables mixed with rice. Traditionally, the meat always includes sausage of some sort, often a smoked meat such as andouille, along with some other seafood, mostly pork, chicken, crawfish, or shrimp. The vegetables are usually a sofrito-like mixture known as the \"holy trinity\" in Cajun cooking, consisting of onion, celery, okra, and green bell pepper, though other vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, chilis, and garlic are also used. After browning and sauteeing the meat and vegetables, rice, seasonings, and broth are added and the entire dish is cooked together until the rice is done.\n\nJambalaya is similar to (but distinct from) other rice-and-meat dishes known in Louisiana cuisine. Gumbo uses similar sausages, meats, seafood, vegetables and seasonings. However, gumbo includes filé powder and okra, which are not common in jambalaya. Gumbo is also usually served over white rice, which is prepared separate from the rest of the dish, unlike jambalaya, where the rice is prepared with the other ingredients. Étouffée is a stew which always includes shellfish such as shrimp or crayfish, but does not have the sausage common to jambalaya and gumbo. Also, like gumbo, étouffée is usually served over separately prepared rice.\n\nJambalaya has its origins in several rice-based dishes well attested in the Mediterranean cuisines of Spain, West Africa and France, especially in the Spanish dish \"paella\" (native to Valencia) , West African dish jollof and the French dish known as \"jambalaia\" (native to Provence). Other seasoned rice-based dishes from other cuisines include pilaf, risotto and Hoppin' John. \n\nThere are two primary methods of making jambalaya, differentiated by the presence or absence of tomatoes.\n\nThe first is Creole jambalaya (also called \"red jambalaya\"). First, meat is added to the trinity of celery, peppers, and onions; the meat is usually chicken and sausage such as andouille or smoked sausage. Next vegetables and tomatoes are added to cook, followed by seafood. Rice and stock are added in equal proportions at the very end. The mixture is brought to a boil and left to simmer for 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the recipe, with infrequent stirring. Towards the end of the cooking process, stirring usually ceases.\nSome versions call for the jambalaya to be baked after the cooking of all the ingredients.\n\nThe second style, more characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the farther away from New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick to the bottom of the pot (sucs) are what give a Cajun jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one's taste) is added and sautéed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the mixture is brought to a boil and rice is added to the pot. It is then covered and left to simmer over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked.\n\nIn a less common method, meat and vegetables are cooked separately from the rice. At the same time, rice is cooked in a savory stock. It is added to the meat and vegetables before serving. This is called \"white jambalaya\". This dish is rare in Louisiana as it is seen as a \"quick\" attempt to make jambalaya, popularized outside the state to shorten cooking time.\n\nMany people in the south, and typically in Louisiana, enjoy a simpler jambalaya style. This style is cooked the same as the Cajun style, but there are no vegetables. Many restaurants serve this style as opposed to the others, because it is more child-friendly, has a more consistent texture, and is easier to make.\n\nJambalaya is considered by most Louisianans to be a filling but simple-to-prepare rice dish; gumbos, étouffées, and creoles are considered more difficult to perfect. Most often a long grain white rice is used in making jambalaya.\n\nJambalaya is differentiated from gumbo and étouffée by the way in which the rice is included. In these dishes, the rice is cooked separately and is served as a bed on which the main dish is served. In the usual method of preparing jambalaya, a rich stock is created from vegetables, meat, and seafood; raw rice is then added to the broth and the flavor is absorbed by the grains as the rice cooks.\n\nThe origin of New Orleans jambalaya is possibly Jollof rice, a West African dish. Many of the slaves that lived in New Orleans came from West Africa and would have been familiar with the dish of Jollof rice. Like jambalaya, Jollof rice was traditionally made from whatever ingredients were handy, such as seafood, crawfish, and various meats. Tomatoes are always present in its preparation.\n\nAnother origin states jambalaya originates from the French Quarter of New Orleans, in the original sector. It was an attempt by the Spanish to make paella in the New World, where saffron was not readily available due to import costs. Tomatoes became the substitute for saffron. As time went on, French influence became strong in New Orleans, and spices from the Caribbean changed this New World paella into a unique dish. In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved along a variety of different lines. Creole jambalaya, or red jambalaya, is found primarily in and around New Orleans, where it is simply known as \"jambalaya\". Creole jambalaya includes tomatoes, whereas Cajun jambalaya does not.\n\nCajun jambalaya originates from Louisiana's rural, low-lying swamp country where crawfish, shrimp, oysters, alligator, duck, turtle, boar, venison, nutria and other game were readily available. Any variety or combination of meats, including chicken or turkey, may be used to make jambalaya. Cajun jambalaya is known as \"brown jambalaya\" in the New Orleans area; to Cajuns it is simply known as \"jambalaya\". Cajun jambalaya has more of a smoky and spicy flavor than its Creole cousin. \n\nThe first appearance in print of any variant of the word 'jambalaya' in any language occurred in \"Leis amours de Vanus; vo, Lou paysan oou théâtré\", by Fortuné (Fortunat) Chailan, first published in Provençal dialect in 1837. The earliest appearance of the word in print in English occurs in the May 1849 issue of the \"American Agriculturalist\", page 161, where Solon Robinson refers to a recipe for 'Hopping Johnny (jambalaya)'. Jambalaya did not appear in a cookbook until 1878, when The Gulf City Cook Book, by the ladies of the St. Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, was printed in South Mobile, Alabama. It contains a recipe for \"JAM BOLAYA\".\n\nJambalaya experienced a brief jump in popularity during the 1920s and 1930s because of its flexible recipe. The dish was little more than the rice and vegetables the populace could afford, but the recipe grew from humble roots.\n\nIn 1968, Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen proclaimed Gonzales, Louisiana, \"the Jambalaya capital of the world\". Every spring, the annual Jambalaya Festival is held in Gonzales.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" indicates that comes from the Provençal word 'jambalaia', meaning a mish mash, or mixup, and also meaning a pilaf (pilau) of rice. This is supported by the fact that the first printed appearance of the word is in a Provençal poem published in 1837.\n\nA folkloric interpretation of the word suggests that it is the fusion of two Spanish words: (\"ham\") + (a rice dish). However, the evidence for this idea is thin. Ham is not a featured element of the dish, and Spanish speakers would call a ham paella , not .\n\nThe Atakapa tribe states the origin of the name. The original word \"Sham, pal ha! Ya!\" means \"Be full, not skinny! Eat Up!\" with a French equivalent of \"Bon appétit!\". Spanish influence resulted in the current spelling of the name.\n\nSimilar dishes:\n\n"}
{"id": "358931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358931", "title": "Club sandwich", "text": "Club sandwich\n\nA club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, or fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. It is often cut into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. Modern versions frequently have two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.\n\nThe club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in \"The Evening World\" on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe; \"Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.\" Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.\n\nOther sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate. Another theory is that the club sandwich was invented in an exclusive Saratoga Springs, New York, gambling club in the late 19th century. \"In 1894 Richard Canfield... the debonair patron of art, purchased the Saratoga Club to make it a casino [Canfield Casino]... the club sandwich [originated] in its kitchens.\" ---\"The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink\", John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 87) \n\nThe sandwich is known to have appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as far back as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from \"Conversations of a Chorus Girl\", a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common.\n\nAs with a BLT, toasted white bread is standard, along with iceberg lettuce, bacon, and tomatoes. The sandwich is traditionally dressed with mayonnaise. Variations, however, on the traditional club sandwich abound. Some vary the protein, for example, a \"breakfast club\" that includes eggs or a \"roast beef club.\" Others include ham (instead of, or in addition to bacon) and/or cheese slices. Vegetarian club sandwiches often include hummus, avocado or spinach, as well as substitute the real bacon with a vegetarian alternative. Mustard and sometimes honey mustard are common condiments. Upscale variations include, for example, the oyster club, the salmon club, and Dungeness crab melt. \n\nThe sandwich is commonly served with an accompaniment of either coleslaw, or potato salad, and often garnished with a pickle. The coleslaw or potato salad is often reduced to a \"garnish\" portion, when the primary accompaniment is an order of french fries or potato chips. Due to high fat and carb content from the bread, bacon and dressing, club sandwiches have sometimes been criticized as unhealthy. In 2000, Burger King came under fire for its chicken club, which contained 700 calories, 44 grams of fat (nine of them saturated), and 1,300 milligrams of sodium, as well as the trans fat from the fryer shortening.\n\n"}
{"id": "359147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359147", "title": "Dosa", "text": "Dosa\n\nDosa is a type of pancake or crèpe, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosa is a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets but is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar, a stuffing of potatoes, and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.\n\nDosa is indigenous to South India; its exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture. According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, dosa (as \"dosai\") was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature. \n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with the Udupi restaurants. Also, the original Tamil dosa was softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa (as \"dosaka\") can be found in \"Manasollasa\", a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, south Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became a landmark that was one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine. It arrived in Mumbai with the Udupi restaurants in the 1930s. K. Krishna Rao, who ran Old Woodlands in Chennai during the early 1940s, is sometimes regarded to be the originator of the masala dosa in its modern form.\n\nDosa is known by several names. The standard transliterations and pronunciations of the word in various South Indian languages are as follows:\n\nDosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is also a good source of protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content. There are also instant mix products for making dosa which usually contain higher amounts of rice.\n\nA mixture of rice and black gram that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a handful of fenugreek seeds soaked along with the rice. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 4:1 or 5:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight. After the overnight fermentation, the batter is mixed with water to get the desired thickness. The batter is then ladled onto a hot \"tava\" (griddle) greased with oil or \"ghee\" (clarified butter). It is spread out evenly with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is also usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.\n\nDosa can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish which varies according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:\n\n\nThe most popular version is the masala dosa, with a filling of the potato masala. Mysore masala is the spicier version of it. Sada (plain) is without filling; paper dosa is a thin and crisp version. Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina. Newer recipes have been developed that use fusion.\n\nThough dosa typically refers to the version made with rice and lentils, many other versions exist.\n\nThe \"masala dosa\" is made by stuffing a dosa with a lightly cooked filling of potatoes, fried onions and spices. The dosa is wrapped around an onion and potato curry or masala.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "359423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359423", "title": "Churro", "text": "Churro\n\nA churro (, ) is a fried-dough pastry—predominantly choux—based snack. Churros are traditional in Spain and Portugal, from where they originate, as well as the Philippines and Ibero-America. They are also consumed in the Southwestern United States, France and other areas that have received immigration from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are known as \"porras\" in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in champurrado, hot chocolate, dulce de leche or café con leche. Sugar is often sprinkled on top.\n\nThe origin of churros is unclear. One theory suggests they were brought to Europe from China by the Portuguese. The Portuguese sailed for the Orient and, as they returned from Ming Dynasty China to Portugal, they brought along with them new culinary techniques, including altering dough for \"youtiao\", also known as \"yóuzháguǐ\" in southern China, for Portugal. The new pastry soon crossed the border into Spain, where it was modified to have the dough extruded through a star-shaped die rather than pulled.\n\nAnother theory is that the churro was made by Spanish shepherds, to substitute for fresh bakery goods. Churro paste was easy to make and fry in an open fire in the mountains, where shepherds spend most of their time.\n\nChurros are fried until they become crunchy, and may be sprinkled with sugar. The surface of a churro is ridged due to having been piped from a churrera, a syringe-like tool with a star-shaped nozzle. Churros are generally prisms in shape, and may be straight, curled or spirally twisted.\n\nLike pretzels, churros are sold by street vendors, who may fry them freshly on the street stand and sell them hot. In Spain and much of Latin America, churros are available in cafes for breakfast, although they may be eaten throughout the day as a snack. Specialized \"churrerías\" can be found in the form of a shop or a trailer during the holiday period. In addition, countries like Colombia, Peru, Spain and Venezuela have churrerías throughout their streets. In Portugal, they are commonly eaten at carnivals, fairs and other celebrations, where they are made freshly at street stands.\n\nThe dough is a mixture of flour, water and salt. Some versions are made of potato dough.\n\nIn Seville (Andalusia), the name \"calientes\" or \"calentitos de rueda\" is sometimes used instead of the word \"churro\". These tend to refer to the thicker variant, called \"porra\". Calientes are usually fried in the shape of a continuous spiral and cut into portions afterwards. The center of the spiral is thicker and softer, and for many a delicacy in itself. The standard \"churro\" is also sold under the name \"calentitos de papas\", the name referring to the softer mashed potato–like texture.\n\nIn parts of Eastern Andalusia, a much thinner dough is used, which does not allow for the typical ridges to be formed on the surface of the churro. The final result therefore has a smooth surface, and is more pliable and of a slightly thinner diameter than standard Spanish churros. Another difference is that sugar is never sprinkled on them, because the flavour is not considered suitable.\n\nFilled, straight \"churros\" are found in Cuba (with fruit, such as guava), Brazil (with chocolate, \"doce de leite\", among others), and in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Mexico (usually filled with \"dulce de leche\" or \"cajeta\" but also with chocolate and vanilla). In Colombia and Venezuela, churros are glazed with arequipe and sweetened condensed milk. In Spain, a considerably wider diameter is used to accommodate the filling. In Uruguay, churros can also come in a savoury version, filled with melted cheese.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"churros\" are typically straight, or bent into U-shapes or circular shapes. They are usually dusted with white sugar. \"Churros\" are almost always eaten with \"tsokolate\" drinks (a pairing known as \"churros con tsokolate\"), which can also serve as a dip. They are popular during the Christmas season.\n\nChurros in American theme parks and street fairs are most often rolled in cinnamon sugar or other flavored sugars.\n\n"}
{"id": "360101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360101", "title": "Fast food", "text": "Fast food\n\nFast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on \"speed of service\" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal. By making speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional \"sit down\" restaurant). For those with no time to spare, fast food became a multibillion-dollar industry.\n\nThe fastest form of \"fast food\" consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer's arrival (Boston Market rotisserie chicken, Little Caesars pizza, etc.), with waiting time reduced to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily the hamburger outlets (McDonald's, Burger King, etc.) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns & condiments, frozen beef patties, prewashed/sliced vegetables, etc.) but take great pains to point out to the customer that the \"meat and potatoes\" (hamburgers and french fries) are always cooked fresh (or at least relatively recently) and assembled \"to order\" (like at a diner).\n\nAlthough a vast variety of food can be \"cooked fast\", \"fast food\" is a commercial term limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away.\n\nFast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as \"quick service restaurants\"). Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.\n\nFast food began with the first fish and chip shops in Britain in the 1860s. Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The term \"fast food\" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.\n\nEating fast food has been linked to, among other things, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, and depression. Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories.\n\nThe traditional family dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is getting lower, with an average couple in the United States spending 47 minutes and 19 seconds per day on food preparation in 2013.\n\nThe concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate space or proper food preparation accouterments. Additionally, procuring cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive, and homeowners feared that a rogue cooking fire \"might easily conflagrate an entire neighborhood\". Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever possible. In Ancient Rome, cities had street stands – a large counter with a receptacle in the middle from which food or drink would have been served. It was during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. This need is what drove the phenomenal success of the early fast food giants, which catered to the family on the go (Franklin A. Jacobs). Fast food became an easy option for a busy family, as is the case for many families today.\n\nIn the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living in \"insulae\", multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for much of their meal; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats. In the mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked vegetables and stews later in \"popina\", a simple type of eating establishment. In Asia, 12th century Chinese scarfed down fried dough, soups, and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack food. Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat meats. During the Middle Ages, large towns and major urban areas such as London and Paris supported numerous vendors that sold dishes such as pies, pasties, flans, waffles, wafers, pancakes and cooked meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers, many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, were among the customers.\n\nIn areas with access to coastal or tidal waters, 'fast food' frequently included local shellfish or seafood, such as oysters or, as in London, eels. Often this seafood was cooked directly on the quay or close by. The development of trawler fishing in the mid-nineteenth century led to the development of a British favourite, fish and chips, and the first shop in 1860.\nA blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries. As a cheap fast food served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the Victorian working classes. By 1910, there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops. Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in 1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\nBritish fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used more frequently in fast food. The UK has adopted fast food from other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also emerged.\n\nAs automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White Castle, founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, is generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet and first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each. Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high-volume, low-cost, high-speed hamburger restaurant. Among its innovations, the company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.\n\nFranchising was introduced in 1921 by A&W Root Beer, which franchised its distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson's first franchised the restaurant concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, signage and advertising.\n\nCurb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the 1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates.\n\nThe United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries. Approximately 4.7 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the USA. Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses have inspired many local government officials in the United States to propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession, suggesting an inelastic demand. However, some areas are more affected than others. In Los Angeles County, for example, about 45% of the restaurants in South Central Los Angeles are fast-food chains or restaurants with minimal seating. By comparison, only 16% of those on the Westside are such restaurants.\n\nThe National Employment Law Project wrote in 2013, \"according to a study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley, more than half (52 percent) of front-line fast-food workers must rely on at least one public assistance program to support their families. As a result, the fast-food-industry business model of low wages, non-existent benefits, and limited work hours costs taxpayers an average of nearly $7 billion every year\". They claim this funding allows these workers to \"afford health care, food, and other basic necessities\" \n\nFast food outlets are \"take-away\" or \"take-out\" providers that promise quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a \"drive-through\" service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles. Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat on-site. In recent times, the boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food from their homes through their smart phone apps.\n\nNearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten \"on the go,\" often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream, though many fast food restaurants offer \"slower\" foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.\n\nConvenience stores located within many petrol/gas stations sell pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts, and hot food. Many gas stations in the United States and Europe also sell frozen foods, and have microwave ovens on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol Stations in Australia sell foods such as hot pies, sandwiches, and chocolate bars, which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before and after shop trading hours therefore it makes it easy to access for consumers.\n\nTraditional street food is available around the world, usually through small and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, portable grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include Vietnamese noodle vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City hot dog carts, and taco trucks. Turo-Turo vendors (Tagalog for point point) are a feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful and varying range of options designed to quickly captivate passers-by and attract as much attention as possible.\n\nDepending on the locale, multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic tradition. In some cultures, it is typical for street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play music, or engage in other forms of \"street theatrics\" to engage prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention than the food.\n\nModern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients and standardized cooking and production methods. It is usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to being able to deliver the order quickly to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.\n\nBecause of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost, fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.\n\nChinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord, sometimes self service. The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.\nSushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world. A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried laver) with filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber.\nPizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with nationwide chains including Papa John's, Domino's Pizza, Sbarro and Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children's fast food calories. Menus are more limited and standardized than in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.\n\nKebab houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East, especially Turkey and Lebanon. Meat is shaven from a rotisserie, and is served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and dressing. These doner kebabs or shawarmas are distinct from shish kebabs served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the world, especially Europe, New Zealand and Australia but they generally are less common in the US.\n\nFish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep fried, and served with deep fried potato strips.\n\nThe Dutch have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal often consists of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat) with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call \"mayonnaise\". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to \"met\" (literally \"with\"). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup (\"curry\"), Indonesian style peanut sauce (\"satésaus\" or \"pindasaus\") or piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces, most famously \"speciaal\" (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and chopped onions; and \"oorlog\" (literally \"war\"): mayonnaise and peanut sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a deep fried skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (deep fried meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).\n\nIn Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most popular foods include \"frango assado\" (Piri-piri grilled chicken previously marinated), francesinha, francesinha poveira, espetada (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and bifanas (pork cutlets in a specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often served with french fries (called \"batatas fritas\"), some international chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese fast food such as Nando's.\n\nAn example of a local form of fast food in Poland is \"pasztecik szczeciński\", a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian filling, typical fast food dish of the city of Szczecin well known in many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish \"List of traditional products\". The first bar serving \"pasztecik szczeciński\", Bar \"Pasztecik\" founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46 in Szczecin.\n\nA fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East. Popular Indian fast food dishes include vada pav, panipuri and dahi vada. In the French-speaking nations of West Africa, roadside stands in and around the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as \"brochettes\" (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name found in Europe).\n\nIn the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012 (up from $6 billion in 1970). In total the US restaurant industry had projected sales of $660.5 billion in 2013. Fast food has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines. Due to this competition, fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales. While overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in these restaurants \"once a month or 'a few times a year'\" has risen.\n\nIn contrast to the rest of the world, American citizens spend a much smaller amount of their income on food — largely due to various government subsidies that make fast food cheap and easily accessible. Calorie for calorie, foods sold in fast food restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and beef.\n\nThe Australian fast food market is valued at more than 2.7 billion GPB and is composed of 1.4 billion fast food meals. This includes meals serviced at 17,000 fast food outlets. The fast food market has experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, which is the most rapidly growing sector of the retail food market.\n\nIn 2012, fast food restaurants spent roughly US$4.6 billion on advertising campaigns, which represented an 8% increase from 2009. In the same period of time, McDonald's spent nearly 3 times as much on advertising as all water, milk, and produce advertisers spent combined.\n\nA study done by researchers from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College saw results that suggest that when children watch more commercial television (and see more advertisements on fast food), they are more inclined to ask to visit these subsequent fast food restaurants. Specifically, fast food restaurants have been increasing their advertising efforts that target black and Hispanic youth. Advertising on Spanish speaking channels increased by 8% in 2012, with KFC and Burger King increasing spending in this demographic by 35% while cutting down on their regular advertising within English speaking channels.\n\nThe Council of Better Business Bureaus started the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2006 which asked fast food companies to pledge to \"advertise only more healthful products to children\" with McDonald's and Burger King signing on. However, despite a slight increase in healthful food advertising, the effectiveness of this initiative has been disputed by studies that reveal that \"children couldn't remember or identify healthful foods in the ads, and that 81 percent of the 99 3 to 7 year olds in that study recalled French fries\" even though there were no French fries in the advertisement.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 4.1 million U.S. workers are employed in food preparation and serving (including fast food) as of 2010. The BLS's projected job outlook expects average growth and excellent opportunity as a result of high turnover. However, in April 2011, McDonald's hired approximately 62,000 new workers and received a million applications for those positions—an acceptance rate of 6.2%. The median age of workers in the industry in 2013 was 28.\nObtaining Human Resource Management diploma or diploma in Fast Food Management can help to get a job in major fast food restaurants since it is one of the most desired. The employment rate for Australians working in the fast food industry is increasingly high, with 17% of people working within the fast food sector in Australia.\n\nIn 2006, the global fast-food market grew by 4.8% and reached a value of £102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions. McDonald's alone, has outlets in 126 countries on 6 continents and operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide.\n\nOne example of McDonald's expansion on a global scale was its introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily lives of natives in Moscow. Thus, the restaurant was strategically implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and established eating habits, also known as the customs around food, eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald's interpreted the local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the produce used in the restaurant. On January 31, 1990 McDonald's opened a restaurant in Moscow and broke opening-day records for customers served. The Moscow restaurant is the busiest in the world.\n\nThe largest McDonald's in the world, with 25,000 feet of play tubes, an arcade and play center, is located in Orlando, Florida, United States\n\nThere are numerous other fast food restaurants located all over the world. Burger King has more than 11,100 restaurants in more than 65 countries. KFC is located in 25 countries. Subway is one of the fastest growing franchises in the world with approximately 39,129 restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009, the first non-US location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain. Wienerwald has spread from Germany into Asia and Africa. Pizza Hut is located in 97 countries, with 100 locations in China. Taco Bell has 278 restaurants located in 14 countries besides the United States.\n\nFast-food chains have come under criticism over concerns ranging from claimed negative health effects, alleged animal cruelty, cases of worker exploitation, and claims of cultural degradation via shifts in people's eating patterns away from traditional foods.\n\nThe intake of fast food is increasing worldwide. A study done in the city of Jeddah has shown that current fast-food habits are related to the increase of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, the World Health Organization published a study which claims that deregulated food markets are largely to blame for the obesity crisis, and suggested tighter regulations to reverse the trend. In the United States, local governments are restricting fast food chains by limiting the number of restaurants found in certain geographical areas.\n\nTo combat criticism, fast-food restaurants are starting to offer more health-friendly menu items. In addition to health critics, there are suggestions for the fast-food industry to become more eco-friendly. The chains have responded by \"reducing packaging waste\".\n\nAlthough trying to overcome criticism through healthy options on fast food menus, Marion Nestle, who serves as the chair of New York University's Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, suggests that fast-food industries intentionally market unhealthy foods to children through advertising options and therefore create customers for life.\n\nDespite so much popularity, fast foods and fast-food chains have adverse impacts not only on the job and social skills, but on the health and academic performance of students. Fifty-six percent of students consume fast food on a weekly basis. The researcher who wrote \"Fast Food Nation\", Eric Schlosser, highlights this fact, arguing that this is not only a financial but also a psychological bait, in that the students are lured towards this early employment opportunity knowing little that the time spent on this no-skill-learning job is wasted. Two other researchers, Charles Hirschman and Irina Voloshin, highlight their dangerous impacts and consequences regarding hiring and firing of teenage school-goers in the fast-food industry. Kelly Brownwell of \"The Atlantic Times\" has further supported this argument that another dangerous practice was adopted by Burger King and McDonald's for marketing to the innocent children.\n\nIn a research study conducted by Professors Purtell Kelly and Gershoff, they found that the students of fifth grades, who ate fast foods as compared to the students of the same age after some other social factors were controlled. Also, the percentage of the students having consumed fast food and showed poor grades was around 11 percent more than those who used organic foods. They are of the view that other social factors such as television watching, video games and playing were controlled to assess the real impacts of the fast foods.\n\nThere have been books and films, such as the 2004 film \"Super Size Me\", designed to highlight the potential negative health effects from the overconsumption of fast food such as its contribution to obesity.\n\n\n"}

Depending on the recipe, it can have julienne carrots and be seasoned with curry powder, ground cloves, turmeric, nutmeg, cumin, and basil, in addition to salt and pepper. Simplified recipes printed in many vintage cookbooks, including the 1946 edition of the \"Joy of Cooking\", used canned, condensed pea and tomato soups as a base with additional vegetables and seasonings.\n\n"}
{"id": "361140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361140", "title": "Turducken", "text": "Turducken\n\nTurducken is a dish consisting of a deboned chicken stuffed into a deboned duck, further stuffed into a deboned turkey. Outside of the United States and Canada, it is known as a three bird roast. Gooducken is a traditional English variant, replacing turkey with goose.\n\nThe word \"turducken\" is a portmanteau of \"turkey\", \"duck\", and \"chicken\". The dish is a form of engastration, which is a recipe method in which one animal is stuffed inside the gastric passage of another.\n\nThe thoracic cavity of the chicken/game hen and the rest of the gaps are stuffed, sometimes with a highly seasoned breadcrumb mixture or sausage meat, although some versions have a different stuffing for each bird. The result is a fairly solid layered poultry dish, suitable for cooking by braising, roasting, grilling, or barbecuing.\n\nCredit for the creation of the turducken is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have been popularized by Cajun chef Paul Prudhomme. The most common claimant is Hebert's Specialty Meats in Maurice, Louisiana, whose owners Junior and Sammy Hebert say they created it in 1985 \"when a local man brought his own birds to their shop and asked the brothers to create the medley\".\n\nA New Orleans surgeon, Dr. Gerald R. LaNasa, was locally known for his use of a scalpel in deboning his three birds of choice, sometimes adding pork or veal roasts in the final hen's cavity, thus preserving the turducken tradition as a regional holiday favorite of the southern United States. Andouille sausage and Foie Gras were always key ingredients of the LaNasa creations. The results of Dr. LaNasa's work can be found in the modern day mass-produced turducken or turduckhen (another variation adding or substituting a cornish game hen). His turkey, duck, and chicken ballotine is now widely commercially available under multiple trademark names. Dr. LaNasa's innovation and success with ballotine, Three Bird Roast and turducken began mid century, expanding in the 1960s and seventies long before many of the popular commercial Cajun/Creole chefs of today took the stage. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, a turducken is a type of ballotine called a \"three-bird roast\" or a \"royal roast\". The Pure Meat Company offered a five-bird roast (a goose, a turkey, a chicken, a pheasant, and a pigeon, stuffed with sausage), described as a modern revival of the traditional Yorkshire Christmas pie, in 1989; and a three-bird roast (a duck stuffed with chicken stuffed with a pigeon, with sage and apple stuffing) in 1990. Multi-bird roasts are widely available.\n\nIn his 1807 \"Almanach des Gourmands\", gastronomist Grimod de La Reynière presents his \"rôti sans pareil\" (\"roast without equal\")—a bustard stuffed with a turkey, a goose, a pheasant, a chicken, a duck, a guinea fowl, a teal, a woodcock, a partridge, a plover, a lapwing, a quail, a thrush, a lark, an ortolan bunting and a garden warbler—although he states that, since similar roasts were produced by ancient Romans, the \"rôti sans pareil\" was not entirely novel. The final bird is very small but large enough to just hold an olive; it also suggests that, unlike modern multi-bird roasts, there was no stuffing or other packing placed in between the birds.\n\n\"Gooducken\" is a goose stuffed with a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken.\n\nAn early form of the recipe was \"Pandora's cushion\", a goose stuffed with a chicken stuffed with a quail.\n\nAnother version of the dish is credited to French diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. The 1891 newspaper article \"French Legends Of The Table\" offers \"Quail a la Talleyrand\":\n\nThe following for instance, is Talleyrand's fanciful and somewhat roundabout way of roasting a quail. On a day of \"inspiration gourmande\" at his hotel in the Rue Saint-Florentin, he composed the following recipe: Take a plump quail, seasoned with truffles, and made tender by having been put into champagne. You put it carefully inside a young Bresse chicken; then sew up the opening, and put dabs of butter all over the chicken. Again, you put the chicken inside a fine Berri turkey, and roast the turkey very carefully before a bright fire. What will be the result? All the juice of the turkey is absorbed by the fowl, and all the juice of the fowl in its turn by the quail. After two hours roasting the fowl, which in reality it composed of three fowls, is ready, and you place the steaming trinity upon a dish of fine porcelain or chiseled silver. Then you pull the chicken out of the turkey, and the quail out of the chicken. The quail? Is it correct to talk of the quail, when this delicious, perfumed dish is indeed too good for any name? You take the quail as you would some sacred relic, and serve it hot, steaming, with its aroma of truffles, after having roasted it to a golden yellow by basting it diligently with the best Gournay butter.\nThe book \"Passion India: The Story of the Spanish Princess of Kapurthula\" (p. 295) features a section that recounts a similar dish in India in the late 1800s:\n\"Invited by Maharajah Ganga Singh to the most extraordinary of dinners, in the palace at Bikaner, when Anita asks her host for the recipe of such a succulent dish, he answers her seriously, \"Prepare a whole camel, skinned and cleaned, put a goat inside it, and inside the goat a turkey and inside the turkey a chicken. Stuff the chicken with a grouse and inside that put a quail and finally inside that a sparrow. Then season it all well, place the camel in a hole in the ground and roast it.\"\n\n\n"}

This candy is formed by allowing a supersaturated solution of sugar and water to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal nucleation, such as a string, stick, or plain granulated sugar. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve thus producing larger crystals. Crystals form after 6 to 7 days. Food coloring may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy.\n\nEtymologically, \"sugar candy\" derives from late 13th century English (in reference to \"crystallized sugar\"), from Old French \"çucre candi\" (meaning \"sugar candy\"), and ultimately from Arabic \"qandi\", from Persian \"qand\" (\"cane sugar\"), probably from Sanskrit \"khanda\" (\"piece of sugar)\", The sense gradually broadened (especially in the U.S.A.) to mean by the late 19th century \"any confection having sugar as its basis\". In Britain these are sweets, and \"candy\" tends to be restricted to sweets made only from boiled sugar and striped in bright colors.\n\nThe modern American term \"rock candy\" (referring to brittle large natural sugar crystals) should not be confused with the British term rock (referring to an amorphous and opaque boiled sugar product, initially hard but then chewy at mouth temperature).\n\nCandied sugar has its origins in Isfahan, Iran. Islamic writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown result of cooling supersaturated sugar solutions. In order to accelerate crystallization, confectioners later learned to immerse small twigs in the solution for the crystals to grow on. The sugar solution was colored with cochineal and indigo, and scented with ambergris or flower essence.\n\nRock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the tea culture of East Frisia, where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called \"nabat\"; the most popular nabat is saffron.\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In China, it is used to sweeten chrysanthemum tea, as well as Cantonese dessert soups and the liquor \"baijiu\". Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of traditional Chinese medicine. \n\nIn Mexico, it is used during the Day of the Dead to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated. Sugar skulls are given to children so they will not fear death; they are also offered to the dead.\n\nIn the Friesland province of the Netherlands, bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white bread \"Fryske Sûkerbôle\".\n\nRock candy is a common ingredient in Tamil cuisine, particularly in the Sri Lankan city of Jaffna.\n\nIn the US, rock candy comes in many colors and flavors, and is slightly hard to find, due to it being considered old-fashioned.\n\nMisri (, , ) refers to crystallized sugar lumps, and a type of confectionery mineral, which has its origins in India and Persia, also known as rock sugar elsewhere. It is used in India as a type of candy, or used to sweeten milk or tea.\n\nIn Hinduism, mishri may be offered to a deity as \"bhog\" and distributed as \"prasad\". The god Krishna is said to be fond of \"makkhan\" (butter) and misri. In many devotional songs written in Brajbhoomi in praise of Krishna, the words \"makkhan\" and \"misri\" are often used in combination. In Northern Karnataka people serve mishri along with water to visitors in the Summer season.\n\nAmong Indian misri dishes are \"mishri-mawa\" (\"kalakand\"), \"mishri-peda\", which are more commonly eaten in Northern-Western India, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Orissa, North coastal of Andhra Pradesh and many other states and parts of India.\n\nThe Ghantewala Halwai of Delhi, who started his career by selling \"Misari mawa\" in 1790 is famous for Misarimawa and sells 40 varieties of sweets made from Misari.\n\nRock and rye is a term used both for alcoholic liqueurs and cocktails using rye whiskey and rock candy, as well as for non-alcoholic beverages made in imitation thereof, such as the \"Rock & Rye\" flavor of soda pop made by Faygo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "365307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365307", "title": "Welsh rarebit", "text": "Welsh rarebit\n\nWelsh rarebit (spelling based on folk etymology) or Welsh rabbit (original spelling) is a traditional Welsh dish made with a savoury sauce of melted cheese and various other ingredients and served hot, after being poured over slices (or other pieces) of toasted bread, or the hot cheese sauce may be served in a chafing dish like a fondue, accompanied by sliced, toasted bread. The names of the dish originate from 18th-century Britain. Despite the name, the dish contains no rabbit meat.\n\nRecipes for Welsh rarebit include the addition of ale, mustard, ground cayenne pepper or ground paprika and Worcestershire sauce. The sauce may also be made by blending cheese and mustard into a Béchamel sauce. Some recipes for Welsh rarebit have become textbook savoury dishes listed by culinary authorities including Auguste Escoffier, Louis Saulnier and others, who tend to use the form Welsh \"rarebit\", emphasizing that it is not a meat dish.\n\nAcknowledging that there is more than one way to make a rarebit, some cookbooks have included two recipes: the \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\" of 1896 provides one béchamel-based recipe and another with beer, \"Le Guide Culinaire\" of 1907 has one with ale and one without, and the \"Constance Spry Cookery Book\" of 1956 has one with flour and one without.\n\nHannah Glasse, in her 1747 cookbook \"The Art of Cookery\", gives recipes for \"Scotch rabbit\", \"Welsh rabbit\" and two versions of \"English rabbit\".\n\nTo make a Scotch rabbit, toast the bread very nicely on both sides, butter it, cut a slice of cheese about as big as the bread, toast it on both sides, and lay it on the bread.\n\nTo make a Welsh rabbit, toast the bread on both sides, then toast the cheese on one side, lay it on the toast, and with a hot iron brown the other side. You may rub it over with mustard.\n\nTo make an English rabbit, toast the bread brown on both sides, lay it in a plate before the fire, pour a glass of red wine over it, and let it soak the wine up. Then cut some cheese very thin and lay it very thick over the bread, put it in a tin oven before the fire, and it will be toasted and browned presently. Serve it away hot.\n\nOr do it thus. Toast the bread and soak it in the wine, set it before the fire, rub butter over the bottom of a plate, lay the cheese on, pour in two or three spoonfuls of white wine, cover it with another plate, set it over a chafing-dish of hot coals for two or three minutes, then stir it till it is done and well mixed. You may stir in a little mustard; when it enough lays it on the bread, just brown it with a hot shovel.\n\nServed with an egg on top, a Welsh rarebit is known as a \"buck rabbit\" or a \"golden buck\".\n\nWelsh rarebit blended with tomato (or tomato soup) is known as Blushing Bunny.\n\nA version of Welsh rarebit called \"\" is traditionally served in the French Nord-pas-de-Calais region.\n\nThe first recorded reference to the dish was \"Welsh rabbit\" in 1725, but the origin of the term is unknown.\n\nThere is some suggestion that Welsh Rabbit derives from a South Wales Valleys staple, in which a generous lump of cheese is placed into a mixture of beaten eggs and milk, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked in the oven until the egg mixture has firmed and the cheese has melted. Onion may be added and the mixture would be eaten with bread and butter and occasionally with the vinegar from pickled beetroot.\n\nThe word \"Welsh\" may have been adopted because it carries a now-archaic sense in English to mean \"foreign, non-native\"—an etymological phenomenon seen in its ultimate ancestor, the Proto-Germanic \"walhaz\" (\"foreigner\") and many of its descendants like the dated sense of German (Romance-speaker). It is also possible that the dish was attributed to the Welsh because they were considered particularly fond of cheese, as evidenced by Andrew Boorde in his \"Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge\" (1542), when he wrote \"I am a Welshman, I do love cause boby, good roasted cheese.\" In Boorde's account, \"cause boby\" is the Welsh \"\", meaning \"baked cheese\", but whether it implies a recipe like Welsh rarebit is a matter of speculation.\n\nThe word \"rarebit\" is a corruption of \"rabbit\", \"Welsh rabbit\" being first recorded in 1725 and the variant \"Welsh rarebit\" being first recorded in 1785 by Francis Grose. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", 'Welsh rarebit' is an \"etymologizing alteration. There is no evidence of the independent use of rarebit\". The word \"rarebit\" has no other use than in Welsh rabbit.\n\n\"Eighteenth-century English cookbooks reveal that it was then considered to be a supper or tavern dish, based on the fine cheddar-type cheeses and the wheat bread [...] . Surprisingly, it seems there was not only a Welsh Rabbit, but also an English Rabbit, an Irish and a Scotch Rabbit, but nary a rarebit.\"\n\nMichael Quinion writes: \"Welsh rabbit is basically cheese on toast (the word is not 'rarebit' by the way, that's the result of false etymology; 'rabbit' is here being used in the same way as 'turtle' in 'mock-turtle soup', which has never been near a turtle, or 'duck' in 'Bombay duck', which was actually a dried fish called bummalo)\".\n\nThe entry in Merriam-Webster's \"Dictionary of English Usage\" is \"Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit\" and states: \"When Francis Grose defined Welsh rabbit in \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" in 1785, he mistakenly indicated that rabbit was a corruption of \"rarebit\". It is not certain that this erroneous idea originated with Grose...\"\n\nIn his 1926 edition of the \"Dictionary of Modern English Usage\", the grammarian H. W. Fowler states a forthright view: \"Welsh Rabbit is amusing and right. Welsh Rarebit is stupid and wrong.\"\n\nThe notion that toasted cheese was a favourite dish irresistible to the Welsh has existed since the Middle Ages. In \"A C Merie Talys\" (100 Merry Tales), a printed book of jokes of 1526 AD (of which William Shakespeare made some use), it is told that God became weary of all the Welshmen in heaven, 'which with their krakynge and babelynge trobelyd all the others', and asked the Porter of Heaven Gate, St Peter, to do something about it. So St Peter went outside the gates and called in a loud voice ' \"Cause bobe\", yt is as moche to say as \"rostyd chese\" ': at which all the Welshmen ran out, and when St Peter saw they were all outside, he went in and locked the gates, which is why there are no Welshmen in heaven. The 1526 compiler says he found this story 'Wryten amonge olde gestys'.\n\nA legend mentioned in \"Betty Crocker's Cookbook\" claims that Welsh peasants were not allowed to eat rabbits caught in hunts on the estates of the nobility, so they used melted cheese as a substitute. The author also claims that Ben Jonson and Charles Dickens ate Welsh rarebit at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, a pub in London. There is no good evidence for any of this; what is more, Ben Jonson died almost a century before the term Welsh rabbit is first attested.\n\nAccording to the American satirist Ambrose Bierce, the continued use of \"rarebit\" was an attempt to rationalise the absence of rabbit, writing in his 1911 \"Devil's Dictionary\": \"RAREBIT n. A Welsh rabbit, in the speech of the humorless, who point out that it is not a rabbit. To whom it may be solemnly explained that the comestible known as toad in the hole is really not a toad, and that \"ris de veau à la financière\" is not the smile of a calf prepared after the recipe of a she-banker.\"\n\nIn H. G. Wells's 1898 short story \"The Man Who Could Work Miracles (story)\" Mr. Fotheringay helps himself to a couple of Welsh rarebits \"out of vacancy\".\n\nThe comic strip \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\", by Winsor McCay, featured the fantastic dreams that various characters had because they ate a Welsh rarebit before going to bed.\n\nIn \"Gomer, the Welsh Rarebit Fiend\", Season 3 Episode 24 of \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", indulging in Welsh rarebit causes Gomer (and later Sgt. Carter) to sleepwalk.\n\nIn the Neil Simon play Plaza Suite, Act I character Karen Nash offers Miss McCormack a Welsh rarebit, in an effort to disrupt an impromptu meeting between her and Sam Nash, Karen's husband. (Nancy Enterprises, 1969)\n\nIn the film \"Phantom Thread\" (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017), Reynolds Woodcock orders a Welsh rarebit for breakfast with a poached egg, bacon, scones, jam (not strawberry), and sausages.\n"}

It was nationalised after the Second World War. Grupa Żywiec S.A. consists of five main breweries: Żywiec Brewery, Elbrewery, Leżajsk, Warka Brewery and Cieszyn Brewery. Currently the Dutch Heineken Group (Heineken International Beheer B.V.), with a 61% shareholding, has control over major operations. The brewery has the capacity of producing 5 million hls a year, making it the largest brewery in Grupa Żywiec.\n\nThe brewery started operating in 1856. It was owned by the Habsburgs until it was confiscated by the post-WWII Communist government of Poland. At the beginning of the 1990s a court case was started by the descendants of the original owners, who sued the Polish government demanding $77 million compensation for the nationalisation and the use of the Habsburg family name and coat of arms for marketing purposes. The case was settled out of court on undisclosed terms in December 2005.\n\nŻywiec Brewery began distribution to other towns of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1913. In the 1990s, the brewery was acquired and modernized by Heineken International.\n\nThe brewery produces several brands of beer, usually pale lagers ranging from 5.6% to 9.5% abv, including \"Żywiec Jasne Pełne\" or \"Żywiec Beer\", a 5.6% abv pale lager, which has been brewed in the town of Żywiec, Poland for almost 150 years, and \"Żywiec Porter\", a dark porter brewed in Cieszyn Brewery.\n\n\"Żywiec Beer\" is sold by the 1pt. can, 1pt. bottles and by the keg. In the United States, it is sold by 12-pack and 6-pack bottles (330 ml / US 11.2 oz.) as well as 500ml cans. It is still brewed by means of traditional methods using all-natural ingredients and mountain spring water.\n\nThe Żywiec logo includes all of the most important historical symbols of the brewery and Poland itself. Żywiec Beer’s prominent front label displays a man and woman, who dance the Krakowiak, a traditional dance of the area of Kraków in historic Lesser Poland. This dancing couple is dressed in classic Polish folk dancing clothes. Kraków’s coat of arms is represented with the crown in the middle of the couple. The coat of arms is also represented by the three spruce trees displayed on the bottom of the label and the year 1856 on top underneath the crown. The name Żywiec is placed on the red sash across the middle of the label with the golden trimming. The Żywiec logo is the most famous mark and brand of beer in Poland and the trademark of the entire brewery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "367427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367427", "title": "Feri Tradition", "text": "Feri Tradition\n\nThe Feri Tradition is an initiatory tradition of modern Pagan Witchcraft. It was founded in California in the 1960s by the Americans Victor Henry Anderson and his wife Cora Anderson.\n\nPractitioners have described it as an ecstatic tradition rather than a fertility tradition. Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression. The Feri Tradition has very diverse influences, such as Huna, Vodou, Faery lore, Kabbalah, Hoodoo, Tantra, and Gnosticism.\n\nIn his study of Wicca, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White characterised Feri as a \"Wiccan\" tradition. He noted however that some practitioners of modern Pagan Witchcraft restrict the term \"Wicca\" to British Traditional Wicca, in which case Feri would not be classified as \"Wicca\"; he deemed this exclusionary definition of the term to be \"unsuitable for academic purposes\". Instead, he characterised Feri as one form of Wicca which is nevertheless distinct from others, such as British Traditional Wicca, Dianic Wicca, and Stregheria. White's characterisation has, however, been widely criticised by Feri practitioners, many of whom do not feel that his classification of Feri as a Wiccan tradition is accurate. Indeed, White's characterisation is unique in treatments of the Feri Tradition, and given the self-identification of Feri practitioners as non-Wiccan it may be most prudent to disregard it.\n\nAnderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, in 1944; they married three days later, on 3 May, claiming that they had encountered each other before in the astral realm. Born in Nyota, Alabama, in January 1915, Cora had been exposed to folk magical practices from childhood; reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a \"root doctor\" who was known among locals as the \"druid\". The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an altar. The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for oak; Cora claimed that she had received the name in a dream. After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess. In 1948, the family moved to Niles, California, later that year purchasing a home in San Leandro. There, Anderson became a member of the Alameda Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and he subsequently remained so for forty years. Victor earned his living as a musician, playing the accordion at events, while Cora worked as a hospital cook. It has been claimed that Anderson could speak Hawaiian, Spanish, Creole, Greek, Italian, and Gothic.\n\nIn the mid-1950s Victor and Cora read \"Witchcraft Today\", a 1954 book by English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, with Cora claiming that Victor corresponded with Gardner for a time. The Pagan studies scholar Chas S. Clifton has suggested that the Andersons used Gardner's work as a \"style guide\" for the development of their own tradition of modern Pagan witchcraft. Similarly, Kelly stated that the Andersons' tradition \"began to more and more resemble that of the Gardnerians\" as the couple learned more about the latter, adopting elements from it.\nAnderson was in correspondence with the Italian-American Wiccan Leo Martello, who encouraged Anderson to found his own coven. Circa 1960, the Andersons founded a coven, naming it Mahealani, after the Hawaiian word for the full moon. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Andersons initiated a number of individuals into the coven. One of these was Gwydion Pendderwen, a friend of their son who shared their interest in the esoteric. Pendderwen contributed to the development of what came to be known as the Feri tradition, with some members of the lineage viewing him as its co-founder. Pendderwen noted that he had first met the family when, aged thirteen, he got into a fight with Victor Elon, although the two later became friends. Pendderwen was particularly influenced by Welsh mythology, and on a visit to Britain he spent time with the Alexandrian Wiccans Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar, subsequently introducing various Alexandrian elements into Feri Wicca. In the early 1970s, the Andersons established a new coven with Pendderwen and his initiate, Alison Harlow. After Pendderwen married, his wife also joined this coven, although it disbanded in 1974.\n\nOver the next four decades, the Andersons would initiate between twenty-five and thirty people into their tradition.\nAnderson has been described as one of the \"founding teachers\" and the \"seminal voice\" of the Feri tradition, although – according to Feri initiate Storm Faerywolf – he preferred to refer to himself as \"Grand Master and a fairy chief\". The original word that the Andersons used for their tradition was \"Vicia\", which Cora claimed was Italian. She added that \"the name Fairy became accidentally attached to our tradition because Victor so often mentioned that word in speaking of nature spirits and Celtic magic\". Early initiates alternately spelled the name of the tradition as \"Fairy\", \"Faery\", or \"Faerie\", although Anderson began using the spelling \"Feri\" during the 1990s to differentiate it from other witchcraft traditions of the same name; not all practitioners followed his example. Cora claimed that \"Feri\" was the word's original spelling, adding that it meant \"the things of magic\". Anderson also referred to his form of Wicca as the \"Pictish\" tradition. In their writing, the Andersons mixed terminology adopted from Huna, Gardnerian Wicca, and Voodoo, believing that all reflected the same underlying magico-religious tradition. It drew heavily upon the huna system developed by Max Freedom Long. According to one Feri initiate, Corvia Blackthorn:\n\nAccording to Kelly:\n\nAccording to one initiate, Jim Schuette, Anderson was \"a taskmaster. He took pride in testing his students.\"\nOne of those initiated into the Anderson's Feri tradition was Starhawk, who incorporated ideas from the Feri tradition when creating Reclaiming. She also included aspects from it in her 1979 book, \"The Spiral Dance\", including mention of the Iron and Pearl Pentagram and the three souls, all of which originated within Feri Wicca.\nAnother prominent initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in the late 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally wrong to charge for teaching.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "367436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367436", "title": "Alexandrian Wicca", "text": "Alexandrian Wicca\n\nAlexandrian Wicca or Alexandrian Witchcraft is a tradition of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, founded by Alex Sanders (also known as \"King of the Witches\") who, with his wife Maxine Sanders, established the tradition in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Alexandrian Wicca is similar in many ways to Gardnerian Wicca, and receives regular mention in books on Wicca as one of the religion's most widely recognized traditions.\n\nThe tradition is based largely upon Gardnerian Wicca, in which Sanders was trained, and also contains elements of ceremonial magic and Qabalah, which Sanders had studied independently.\nMaxine Sanders recalls that the name was chosen when Stewart Farrar, a student of the Sanders', began to write \"What Witches Do\". \"Stewart asked what Witches who were initiated via our Covens should be called; after much discussion, he came up with \"Alexandrian\" which both Alex and I rather liked. Before this time we were very happy to be called Witches\". Conversely, the most recent edition of \"What Witches Do\" (2010) includes previously published interviews between Sanders and Farrar. \n\nAlexandrian Wicca is practiced outside of Britain, including Canada, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, the United States, Australia, Brazil and South Africa.\n\nAlexandrian Wicca, in similarity with other traditional Wiccan practices, emphasizes gender polarity. This emphasis can be seen in the Sabbat rituals, which focus on the relationship between the Wiccan Goddess and God.\n\nAs compared to Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca is \"somewhat more eclectic\", according to \"The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism\". Maxine Sanders notes that Alexandrians take the attitude \"If it works use it\". Tool use and deity and elemental names also differ from the Gardnerian tradition. Skyclad practice, or ritual nudity, is optional within the tradition, training is emphasized, and ceremonial magic practices, such as those derived from Hermetic Qabalah and Enochian magic may be part of ritual. Alex's work on his \"Book of Shadows\" continued up until his death resulting, like the Gardnerian in several different versions. Some of these derived from his teaching notes that his students received in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is not unusual to find that earlier initiates did not receive the same books as later ones although they obtained all the information in dictated form, Sander's preferred mode of teaching.\n\nAlexandrian covens meet on new moons, full moons and during Sabbat festivals.\n\nAlexandrian Wicca shares with other traditional Wicca systems the belief that \"only a witch can make another witch\". The process through which an individual is made a witch is called \"initiation\". As in Gardnerian Wicca, there are three levels, or \"degrees\", of initiation, commonly referred to as \"first\", \"second\", and \"third\" degree. Only a second or third degree witch can initiate another into witchcraft, and only a third degree witch can initiate another to third degree. A third degree initiate is referred to as a \"High Priestess\" or \"High Priest\". The Farrars published the rituals for the three ceremonies of initiation in \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\".\n\nSome Alexandrians have instituted a preliminary rank called \"neophyte\" or \"dedicant.\" In these Alexandrian covens, a neophyte is not bound by the oaths taken by initiates, and thus has an opportunity to examine the tradition before committing to it. Neophytes are not, however, considered to have actually joined the tradition until they do take first degree. As such they would not experience certain aspects of rituals that were considered oathbound.\n\nHistorian Ronald Hutton records comments from British practitioners of Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca that distinctions between the two traditions have blurred in the last couple of decades, and some initiates of both traditions have recognized initiation within one as qualification for the other. Author Vivianne Crowley often trains her students in both traditions. In the United States, Alexandrian priestess Mary Nesnick, an initiate of both traditions, created a deliberate fusion of the two, which she named the Algard Tradition.\n\nJanet and Stewart Farrar, both of whom were initiated into the Alexandrian tradition by the Sanderses, describe themselves as having left the tradition after the release of \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\". They were later referred to as \"Reformed Alexandrian\", a description that Janet Farrar does not use preferring just to refer to herself and her initiates as witches. Chthonioi Alexandrian Wicca and the \"Starkindler Line\" are derived from Alexandrian Wicca, and Alexandrian Wicca was a major influence on Blue Star Wicca and Odyssean Wicca.\n\nThe High Magical and Qabalistic strands of the Alexandrian tradition also informed the \"Ordine Della Luna in Constantinople\" which, from 1967 onwards, Sanders operated as a 'side-degree' or ancillary rite to Alexandrian Wicca, most notably in collaboration with Derek Taylor in the 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "367831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367831", "title": "Inferior good", "text": "Inferior good\n\nIn economics, an inferior good is a good whose demand decreases when consumer income rises (or demand increases when consumer income decreases), unlike normal goods, for which the opposite is observed. Normal goods are those goods for which the demand rises as consumer income rises.\nThis would be the opposite of a superior good, one that is often associated with wealth and the wealthy, whereas an inferior good is associated with lower socio-economic groups.\n\nInferiority, in this sense, is an observable fact relating to affordability rather than a statement about the quality of the good. As a rule, these goods are affordable and adequately fulfill their purpose, but as more costly substitutes that offer more pleasure (or at least variety) become available, the use of the inferior goods diminishes.\n\nDepending on consumer or market indifference curves, the amount of a good bought can either increase, decrease, or stay the same when income increases.\n\nThere are many examples of inferior goods. A number of economists have suggested that shopping at large discount chains such as Walmart and rent-to-own establishments vastly represent a large percentage of goods referred to as \"inferior\". Cheaper cars are examples of the inferior goods. Consumers will generally prefer cheaper cars when their income is constricted. As a consumer's income increases, the demand of the cheap cars will decrease, while demand of costly cars will increase, so cheap cars are inferior goods.\n\nInter-city bus service is also an example of an inferior good. This form of transportation is cheaper than air or rail travel, but is more time-consuming. When money is constricted, traveling by bus becomes more acceptable, but when money is more abundant than time, more rapid transport is preferred. In some countries with less developed or poorly maintained railways this is reversed: trains are slower and cheaper than buses, so rail travel is an inferior good.\n\nCertain financial services, including payday lending, are inferior goods. Such financial services are generally marketed to persons with low incomes. People with middle or higher incomes can typically use credit cards that have better terms of payment or bank loans for higher volumes and much lower rates of interest. \n\nInexpensive foods like instant noodles, bologna, pizza, hamburger, mass-market beer, frozen dinners, and canned goods are additional examples of inferior goods. As incomes rise, one tends to purchase more expensive, appealing or nutritious foods. Likewise, goods and services used by poor people for which richer people have alternatives exemplify inferior goods. As a rule, used and obsolete goods (but not antiques) marketed to persons of low income as closeouts are inferior goods at the time even if they had earlier been normal goods or even luxury goods.\n\nOthers are very inconsistent across geographic regions or cultures. The potato, for example, generally conforms to the demand function of an inferior good in the Andean region where the crop originated. People of higher incomes and/or those who have migrated to coastal areas are more likely to prefer other staples such as rice or wheat products as they can afford them. However, in several countries of Asia, such as Bangladesh, potatoes are not an inferior good, but rather a relatively expensive source of calories and a high-prestige food, especially when eaten in the form of “French fries” by urban elites.\n\nA special type of inferior good may exist known as the Giffen good, which would disobey the \"law of demand\". Quite simply, when the price of a Giffen good increases, the demand for that good increases. This would have to be a good that is such a large proportion of a person or market's consumption that the income effect of a price increase would produce, effectively, more demand. The observed demand curve would slope \"upward\", indicating positive elasticity.\n\nIt was noted by Sir Robert Giffen that in Ireland during the 19th century there was a rise in the price of potatoes. The poor people were forced to reduce their consumption of meat and expensive items such as eggs. Potatoes still being the cheapest food, in order to compensate they started consuming more even though its price was rising. This phenomenon is often described as \"Giffen's Paradox\".\n\n"}
{"id": "368393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368393", "title": "Hardtack", "text": "Hardtack\n\nHardtack (or hard tack) is a simple type of biscuit or cracker, made from flour, water, and sometimes salt. Hardtack is inexpensive and long-lasting. It is used for sustenance in the absence of perishable foods, commonly during long sea voyages, land migrations, and military campaigns.\n\nThe name is derived from \"tack\", the British sailor slang for food. It is known by other names such as brewis (possibly a cognate with \"brose\"), \"cabin bread\", \"pilot bread\", \"sea biscuit\", \"soda crackers\", \"sea bread\" (as rations for sailors), \"ship's biscuit\", or pejoratively as \"dog biscuits\", \"molar breakers\", \"sheet iron\", \"tooth dullers\", or \"worm castles.\" Australian and New Zealand military personnel knew them with some sarcasm as \"ANZAC wafers\" (not to be confused with Anzac biscuit).\n\nThe introduction of the baking of processed cereals, including the creation of flour, provided a more reliable source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat brittle loaf of millet bread called dhourra cake, while the Romans had a biscuit called bucellatum. King Richard I of England left for the Third Crusade (1189–92) with \"biskit of muslin\", which was a mixed grain compound of barley, bean flour, and rye.\n\nSome early physicians associated most medical problems with digestion. Hence, for sustenance and health, eating a biscuit daily was considered good for one's constitution. The bakers of the time made biscuits as hard as possible, as the biscuits would soften and become more palatable with time due to exposure to humidity and other weather elements. Because it is hard and dry, hardtack (when properly stored and transported) will survive rough handling and temperature extremes. The more refined captain's biscuit was made with finer flour.\n\nTo soften, hardtack was often dunked in brine, coffee, or some other liquid, or cooked into a skillet meal. Because it was baked hard, it would stay intact for years if kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two, and prepared six months before sailing.\n\nIn 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of hardtack, plus one gallon of small beer. In 1667, Samuel Pepys first regularized naval victualing with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualing Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which it was baked. When machinery was introduced into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about two yards long and one yard wide which were then stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal shaped biscuits. The hexagonal shape meant a saving in material and time and made them easier to pack than the traditional circular shaped biscuit. Hardtack remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's diet until the introduction of canned foods; canned meat was first marketed in 1814, and preserved beef in tins was officially introduced to the Royal Navy rations in 1847.\n\nHardtack, crumbled or pounded fine and used as a thickener, was a key ingredient in New England seafood chowders from the late 1700s.\n\nIn 1801, Josiah Bent began a baking operation in Milton, Massachusetts, selling \"water crackers\" or biscuits made of flour and water that would not deteriorate during long sea voyages from the port of Boston, which was also used extensively as a source of food by the gold prospectors who migrated to the gold mines of California in 1849. Since the journey took months, hardtack, which could be kept a long time, was stored in the wagon trains. Bent's company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the American Civil War. The G. H. Bent Company remains in Milton and continues to sell these items to Civil War re-enactors and others.\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–65), three-inch by three-inch (7.5 cm by 7.5 cm) hardtack was shipped from Union and Confederate storehouses. Some of this hardtack had been stored from the 1846–48 Mexican–American War. With insect infestation common in improperly stored provisions, soldiers would break up the hardtack and drop it into their morning coffee. This would not only soften the hardtack but the insects, mostly weevil larvae, would float to the top, and the soldiers could skim off the insects and resume consumption. Some men also turned hardtack into a mush by breaking it up with blows from their rifle butts, then adding water. If the men had a frying pan, they could cook the mush into a lumpy pancake; otherwise they dropped the mush directly on the coals of their campfire. They also mixed hardtack with brown sugar, hot water, and sometimes whiskey to create what they called a pudding, to serve as dessert.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War in 1898, some military hardtack was stamped with the phrase \"Remember the \"Maine\"\".\n\nCommercially available hardtack is a significant source of food energy in a small, durable package. A store-bought 24-gram cracker can contain 100 kilocalories (20 percent from fat), 2 grams of protein and practically no fiber.\n\nMa Bo mentioned hardtack as being a staple food of Chinese hard-labor workers in Inner Mongolia, during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHardtack was a staple of military servicemen in Japan and South Korea well into the late 20th century. It is known as \"Kanpan\" (乾パン) in Japan and \"geonbbang (geonppang, 건빵)\" in South Korea, meaning 'dry bread', and is still sold as a fairly popular snack food in both countries. (Canned kanpan is also distributed in Japan as emergency rations in case of earthquake, flood, or other disaster.) A harder hardtack than Kanpan, called \"Katapan\" (堅パン), is historically popular in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka, Japan as one of its regional specialty foods. In Korea, geonppang (hardtacks) mixed with konpeito as a medley is considered a popular snack.\nIn Genoa, hardtack was and still is a traditional addition to a fish and vegetable salad called cappon magro.\n\nHardtack, baked with or without the addition of fat, was and still is a staple in Russian military rations, especially in the Navy, as infantry traditionally preferred simple dried bread when long shelf life was needed. Called \"galeta\" (галета) in Russian, it is usually somewhat softer and more crumbly than traditional hardtack, as most varieties made in Russia include at least some fat or shortening, making them closer to saltine crackers. One such variety, \"khlyebtsy armyeyskiye\" (хлебцы армейские), or \"army crackers\", is included in Russian military rations. Other brands enjoy significant popularity among the civilian population as well, both among campers and the general populace.\n\nIn Germany, hardtack is included in every military ration and colloquially known as \"Panzerplatten\" (Armor plates). Due to conscription for many years, a large part of the male population knows about them from their service and thus, became very popular even in civilian use. The company that makes them also sells them unaltered to the civilian market. They are said to have many properties, some jokingly assigned, such as the ability to combine them with standard issue shoe polish to create a flamable device, or to glue them onto vehicles to increase their armor protection. One quality, liked by many soldiers, is its ability to hinder one's need to defecate, some claiming they didn't need to go for 3 days after consuming large quantities of them.\n\nIn Poland hardtacks (known by official name: \"Suchary Specjalne SU-1\" or \"SU-2\" - Special Hardtacks) are still present in Polish Army military rations. In military slang they are called \"Pancerwafle\" (Armor wafers). They are very popular also amongst civilians.\n\nHardtack remains popular today in Papua New Guinea. The Lae Biscuit Company, which is the most commonly found and popular brand in that country, makes multiple lines of different varieties of hardtack.\n\nHardtack is a mainstay in parts of Canada. Canawa is one Canadian maker of traditional hardtack. They specialize in a high density, high caloric product that is well suited for use by expeditions.\n\nPurity Factories, located in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, currently bakes three varieties of hardtack: \n\nInterbake Foods of Richmond, Virginia, produces most, if not all, of the commercially available hardtack in the United States, under the \"Sailor Boy\" label. As of January 2015, 98 percent of its production goes to Alaska. Alaskans are among the last to still eat hardtack as a significant part of their normal diet. Originally imported as a food product that could endure the rigors of transportation throughout Alaska, hardtack has remained a favored food even as other, less robust foods have become more readily available. Alaskan law requires all light aircraft to carry \"survival gear\", including food. Therefore, the blue-and-white Sailor Boy Pilot Bread boxes are ubiquitous at Alaskan airstrips, in cabins, and in virtually every village. Unlike the traditional hardtack recipe, Sailor Boy Pilot Bread contains leavening and vegetable shortening.\n\nHardtack is also a common pantry item in Hawaii, and The Diamond Bakery's \"Saloon Pilot\" cracker is available there in grocery and convenience stores. The round hardtack crackers are available in large- and small-diameter sizes.\n\nThose who buy commercially baked hardtack in the continental US are often those who stock up on long-lasting foods for disaster survival rations. Hardtack can comprise the bulk of dry food storage for some campers.\n\nMany other people who currently buy or bake hardtack in the US are Civil War re-enactors. One of the units that continually bakes hardtack for living history is the USS \"Tahoma\" Marine Guard Infantry of the Washington State Civil War Association.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "369832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369832", "title": "Frozen yogurt", "text": "Frozen yogurt\n\nFrozen yogurt (also spelled frozen yoghurt; also known as frogurt or by the tradename Froyo ) is a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy products and non-dairy products. It is usually more tart than ice cream, as well as lower in fat (due to the use of milk instead of cream). It is different from ice milk (more recently termed low-fat or light ice cream) and conventional soft serve. Unlike yogurt, frozen yogurt is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but is regulated by some U.S. states. Frozen yogurt may or may not contain live and active bacteria cultures.\n\nPeople have been eating plain yogurt for over four millennia, particularly in the Middle East and India. Yogurt was brought to the U.S. in the early 1900s and steadily increased in popularity as a health food item over the next several decades. In the 1930s Dannon began selling prepackaged yogurt for the first time in the U.S. By the 1970s, with the popularity of ice cream surging, freezing and production technology was transferred to the production of frozen yogurt. Many consumers, however, complained about the yogurt taste.\nCapitalizing on consumer demand for a sweet product that tasted like ice cream but was healthier, TCBY opened its first store in 1981. Unlike previous pre-packaged versions introduced earlier, TCBY's yogurt was soft-serve dispensed at the point of sale through a machine. TCBY became the largest frozen yogurt franchise in the world at that time. As others saw the success of TCBY, frozen yogurt took off in the 1980s, reaching sales of $25 million in 1986. Brands such as Colombo, Nanci's, and Miss Karen's came to prominence around that time in the United States and frozen yogurt was 10% of the frozen dessert market accounting for over $300 million in sales by the mid 1990s. Demand for frozen yogurt slowed considerably in the late 1990s as Americans turned their attention to high-protein, high-fat diets. Low-fat foods such as frozen yogurt fell out of favor as food trends favored higher fat and lower cost ice cream at the turn of the millennium.\n\nTrends changed back to frozen yogurt in the mid 2000s with the advent of live probiotic powder-based mixes invented by John Wudel, pioneer of alternative sweeteners in the frozen dessert industry. Dry base mix made frozen yogurt accessible in many countries outside the United States for the first time. Consumer demand for tart frozen yogurt reached unprecedented levels by 2013 all over the United States and many other countries marking a stark contrast to tart frozen yogurt's initial reception in the 1970s.\n\nFrozen yogurt usually consists of milk solids, some kind of sweetener, milk fat, yogurt culture (\"Lactobacillus bulgaricus\" and \"Streptococcus thermophilus\" are common cultures), natural or artificial flavorings, and sometimes natural or artificial coloring.\n\nMilk fat comprises about 0.55–6% of the yogurt. Added in quantities inversely proportional to the amount of milk solids, the milk fat lends richness to the yogurt. Milk solids account for 8–14% of the yogurt's volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting. Cane or beet sugar provides 15–17% of the yogurt's ingredients. In addition to adding sweetness, the sugar increases the volume of solid ingredients in the yogurt, improving body and texture. Animal gelatin and/or vegetable additives (guar gum, carrageenan, etc.) stabilize the yogurt, reducing crystallization and increasing the temperature at which the yogurt will melt. This stabilization ensures that the frozen yogurt maintains a smooth consistency regardless of handling or temperature change.\n\nMajor companies often use assembly lines specifically dedicated to frozen yogurt production. The milk products and stabilizing agent(s) are combined and homogenized. At 32 °C, the yogurt culture is added. The mix remains at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling. After that, the mix is cooled at a temperature of 0 to 4 °C. Once it has reached the desired temperature and viscosity, the yogurt is allowed to sit in aging tanks for up to four hours. Sweeteners, flavorings, and colorings are then mixed in, and the yogurt mixture is cooled at a temperature of −6 to −2 °C. To create extra volume and smooth consistency, air is incorporated into the yogurt as the mixture is agitated. When a sufficient amount of air has been incorporated into the product, the yogurt is rapidly frozen to prevent the formation of large ice crystals, and stored in a cold place to be shipped.\n\nFrozen yogurt can be made in a soft serve freezer in much the same way as soft ice cream. Frozen yogurt mix is sold in powder form that needs to be mixed with water or liquid form ready to pour into a soft serve machine. A mix with high fat or low fat content can be chosen, and the amount of air introduced into the soft serve frozen yogurt is variable. The higher the level of fat, the more air the yogurt can absorb; and the more air that is introduced into the mix as it freezes, the creamier the product will taste.\n\nFrozen yogurt is served in a large variety of flavors and styles. Since it is considered healthier, frozen yogurt also has sugar-free alternatives. Frozen yogurt shops usually offer a multitude of toppings, from fruit to nuts, popular cookie brands and candies. Some frozen yogurt companies offer a more tart version considered closer to the original recipe. Whereas others focus on making their frozen yogurt taste more like ice cream.\n\nIn May 2010, Google released their operating system, Android 2.2, codenamed Froyo. Each major release of Android is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat.\n\n"}
{"id": "370309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370309", "title": "Absence seizure", "text": "Absence seizure\n\nAbsence seizures are one of several kinds of generalized seizures. These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures (from the French for \"little illness\", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absence seizures are characterized by a brief loss and return of consciousness, generally not followed by a period of lethargy (i.e. without a notable postictal state).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of absence seizures vary significantly among patients. Impairment of consciousness is the essential symptom, and may be the only clinical symptom, but this can be combined with other manifestations. The hallmark of the absence seizures is abrupt and sudden-onset impairment of consciousness, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward rotation of the eyes. If the patient is speaking, speech is slowed or interrupted; if walking, they stand transfixed; if eating, the food will stop on its way to the mouth. Usually, the patient will be unresponsive when addressed. In some cases, attacks are aborted when the patient is called. The attack lasts from a few seconds to half a minute, and evaporates as rapidly as it commenced. Absence seizures generally are not followed by a period of disorientation or lethargy (post-ictal state), in contrast to the majority of seizure disorders.\nMixed forms of absence frequently occur.\nThese seizures can happen a few times a day or in some cases hundreds of times a day, to the point that the person cannot concentrate in school or in other situations requiring sustained, concentrated attention.\n\nTypical absences are easily induced by hyperventilation in more than 90% of people with typical absences. This is a reliable test for the diagnosis of absence seizures: a patient suspected of typical absences should be asked to overbreathe for 3 minutes, counting their breaths. Intermittent photic stimulation may precipitate or facilitate absence seizures; eyelid myoclonia is a common clinical feature. \n\nA specific mechanism difference exists in absence seizures in that T-type Ca++ channels are believed to be involved. Ethosuximide is specific for these channels and thus it is not effective for treating other types of seizure. Valproate and gabapentin (among others) have multiple mechanisms of action including blockade of T-type Ca++ channels and are useful in treating multiple seizure types. Gabapentin can aggravate absence seizures.\n\nThe primary diagnostic test for absence seizures is EEG. However, brain scans such as by an MRI can help rule out other diseases, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.\n\nDuring electroencephalography, hyperventilation can be used to provoke these seizures. Ambulatory EEG monitoring over 24 hours can quantify the number of seizures per day and their most likely times of occurrence.\n\nAbsence seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds) generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. When someone experiences an absence seizure they are often unaware of their episode. Those most susceptible to this are children, and the first episode usually occurs between 4–12 years old. It is very rare that someone older will experience their first absence seizure. Episodes of absence seizures can often be mistaken for inattentiveness when misdiagnosed, and can occur 50-100 times a day. They can be so difficult to detect that some people may go months or years before being given a proper diagnosis. There are no known before or after effects of absence seizures.\n\nAbsence seizures have two essential components:\n\nAbsence seizures are broadly divided into typical and atypical types: \n\nThese syndromes are childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with myoclonic absences, juvenile absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Other proposed syndromes are Jeavons syndrome (eyelid myoclonia with absences), and genetic generalised epilepsy with phantom absences.\n\nThese types of seizures are also known to occur to patients suffering with porphyria and can be triggered by stress or other porphyrin-inducing factors.\n\nTreatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with valproic acid or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective, with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free. This view has been recently confirmed by Glauser et al. (2010), who studied the effects of ethosuximide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy. Drug dosages were incrementally increased until the child was free of seizures, the maximal allowable dose was reached, or a criterion indicating treatment failure was met. The primary outcome was freedom from treatment failure after 16 weeks of therapy; the secondary outcome was attentional dysfunction. After 16 weeks of therapy, the freedom-from-failure rates for ethosuximide and valproic acid were similar and were higher than the rate for lamotrigine. There were no significant differences between the three drugs with regard to discontinuation because of adverse events. Attentional dysfunction was more common with valproic acid than with ethosuximide.\nIf monotherapy fails or unacceptable adverse reactions appear, replacement of one by another of the three antiepileptic drugs is the alternative. Adding small doses of lamotrigine to sodium valproate may be the best combination in resistant cases.\n\nWhile ethosuximide is effective in treating only absence seizures, valproic acid is effective in treating multiple seizure types including tonic-clonic seizure and partial seizure, as such it may be a better choice if a patient is exhibiting multiple types of seizures.\nSimilarly, lamotrigine treats multiple seizure types including partial seizures and generalized seizures, therefore it is also an option for patients with multiple seizure types. Clonazepam (Klonopin, Rivotril) is effective in the short term but is not generally recommended for treatment of absence seizure because of the rapid development of tolerance and high frequency of side effects.\n\nCarbamazepine, vigabatrin, and tiagabine are contraindicated in the treatment of absence seizures, irrespective of cause and severity. This is based on clinical and experimental evidence. In particular, the GABA agonists vigabatrin and tiagabine are used to induce, not to treat, absence seizures and absence status epilepticus. Similarly, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, gabapentin, and pregabalin should not be used in the treatment of absence seizures because these medications may worsen absence seizures.\n\nIn the treatment of absence seizures there is often insufficient evidence for which of the available medications has the best combination of safety and efficacy for a particular patient. Nor is it easily known how long a medication must be continued before an off-medication trial should be conducted to determine whether the patient has outgrown the absence seizures, as is often the case in children.\nTo date there have been no published results of any large, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies comparing the efficacy and safety of these or any other medications for absence seizures. The studies that exist have been small and not produced clear conclusions.\n\n"}

It is known traditionally, by various other names, in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and from the 19th century became popular as \"shashlik\" across much of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe word \"shish\" means skewer. The word \"shishlik\" is literally translated from Turkic languages as \"skewerable\". Even though the word \"shashlyk\" was borrowed from the Crimean Tatars by the Cossacks as early as the 16th century, shashlik did not reach Moscow until the late 19th century. From then on, its popularity spread rapidly; by the 1910s it was a staple in St Petersburg restaurants and by the 1920s it was already a pervasive street food all over urban Russia.\n\nShashlik was originally made of lamb. Nowadays it is also made of pork or beef depending on local preferences and religious observances. The skewers are either threaded with meat only, or with alternating pieces of meat, fat, and vegetables, such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato. In Iranian cuisine, meat for shashlik (as opposed to other forms of \"shish kebab\") is usually in form of large chunks of meat, while elsewhere the form of medium-size meat cubes is maintained making it similar to brochette. The meat is marinated overnight in a high-acidity marinade like vinegar, dry wine or sour fruit/vegetable juice with the addition of onions, herbs and spices.\n\nWhile it is not unusual to see shashlik today listed on the menu of restaurants, it is more commonly sold in the form of fast-food by street vendors who roast the skewers over wood, charcoal, or coal. It is also cooked in outdoor environments during social gatherings, similarly to barbecue in English-speaking countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "371575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371575", "title": "Lebkuchen", "text": "Lebkuchen\n\nLebkuchen (), or Pfefferkuchen, is a traditional German baked Christmas treat, somewhat resembling gingerbread.\n\nThe etymology of \"Leb-\" in the term \"Lebkuchen\" is uncertain. Proposed derivations include: from the Latin \"libum\" (flat bread), from the Germanic word \"Laib\" (loaf), and from the Germanic word \"lebbe\" (very sweet). Another likely possibility is that it comes from the old term \"Leb-Honig\", the rather solid crystallized honey taken from the hive, that cannot be used for much beside baking. Folk etymology often associates the name with \"Leben\" (life), \"Leib\" (body), or \"Leibspeise\" (favorite food). \"Kuchen\" means 'cake'.\n\nThe forerunner of today's \"Lebkuchen\" was called the \"honey cake\", and its history can be traced back to the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. They believed that honey, the only sweetener widely available to them, was a gift of the deities and had magical and healing powers. Honey cakes were also worn as a talisman in battle or as protection against evil spirits.\n\nLebkuchen was invented by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. \"Lebkuchen\" bakers were recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm, and 1395 in Nürnberg (Nuremberg). The latter is the most famous exporter today of the product known as \"Nürnberger Lebkuchen\" (Nuremberg Lebkuchen).\n\nLocal history in Nuremberg relates that emperor Friedrich III held a Reichstag there in 1487 and he invited the children of the city to a special event where he presented Lebkuchen bearing his printed portrait to almost four thousand children. Historically, and due to differences in the ingredients, \"Lebkuchen\" is also known as \"honey cake\" () or \"pepper cake\" (). Traditionally, the cookies are usually quite large and may be in diameter if round, and larger if rectangular.\n\nSince 1808, a variety of Nürnberg Lebkuchen made without flour has been called \"Elisenlebkuchen\". It is uncertain whether Elise was the daughter of a gingerbread baker or the wife of a margrave. Her name is associated with some of the Lebkuchen produced by members of the guild. Since 1996, \"\" is a protected designation of origin, meaning that it must be produced within the boundaries of the city.\n\n\"Lebkuchen\" range in taste from spicy to sweet and come in a variety of shapes with round being the most common. The ingredients usually include honey, spices such as aniseed, coriander, cloves, ginger, cardamom, and allspice, nuts including almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, or candied fruit.\n\nIn Germany, types of \"Lebkuchen\" are distinguished by the kind of nuts used and their proportions. Salt of Hartshorn and potash are often used for raising the dough. \"Lebkuchen\" dough is usually placed on a thin wafer base called \"Oblate\". This was an idea of the monks, who used unleavened communion wafer ingredients to prevent the dough from sticking. Typically, they are glazed or covered with very dark chocolate, but some are left uncoated.\n\n\"Lebkuchen\" is usually soft, but a harder type of \"Lebkuchen\" is used to produce \"Lebkuchenherzen\" (\"\"Lebkuchen\" hearts\"), usually inscribed with icing, which are available at many German regional fairs and Christmas fairs. They are also sold as souvenirs at the Oktoberfest and are inscribed with affectionate, sarcastic or obscene messages.\n\nAnother form is the \"witch's house\" (\"\" or \"Hexenhäuschen\"), made popular because of the fairy tales about Hansel and Gretel.\n\nThe closest German equivalent of the gingerbread man is the \"\" (\"honey cake horse\").\n\nThe Nuremberg type of \"Lebkuchen\" is also known as \"Elisenlebkuchen\" and must contain no less than 25 percent nuts and less than 10 percent wheat flour. The finest artisian lebkuchen bakeries in Nuremberg boast close to 40% nut content. \"Lebkuchen\" is sometimes packaged in richly decorated tins, chests, and boxes, which have become nostalgic collector items.\n\n\n"}

This mix may be combined with one or more liquids like milk, almond milk, other plant milks, yogurt, or fruit juice and left for a time to soften the oats before being consumed. The cereal is served cold.\n\nDeveloped around 1900 by Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital, muesli is available ready-made in prepackaged dry form, or it can be made from scratch. In Switzerland and Germany, it is also eaten as a light evening dish called \"Birchermüesli complet\": muesli with bread (\"butterbrot)\" and coffee with milk (\"café au lait\").\nOriginally known in Swiss German as \"Birchermüesli\" or simply \"Müesli\", the word is an Alemannic diminutive of \"Mues\" which means \"puree\" or \"mash-up.\"\n\nMuesli was not originally intended as a breakfast food, but an appetizer similar to bread and butter. It was consumed as \"Schweizer Znacht\" (supper), but not as a breakfast cereal. It was introduced around 1900 by the Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital, where a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables was an essential part of therapy. It was inspired by a similar \"strange dish\" that he and his wife had been served on a hike in the Swiss Alps.\n\nBircher-Benner himself referred to the dish simply as \"d'Spys\" (Swiss German for \"the dish\", in German \"die Speise\"); it was commonly known as \"Apfeldiätspeise\" (Apple Diet Meal). Bircher opened a chalet style \"health sanitorium\" in Zürichberg called Lebendige Kraft. These facilities had risen in popularity during the era of \"lebensreform\" which valued trends of freedom, hippy ideals and vegetarianism.\n\nThe original Bircher-Benner recipe consists of the following ingredients:\n\n\nThe dish was prepared by mixing the cream and honey or condensed milk with the soaked oats and lemon juice and, while stirring, grating the whole apple into the mixture. This method prevented the apple pulp from browning. The intent was to serve the dish fresh, immediately before any other dishes in the meal.\n\nMuesli usually and traditionally is freshly prepared using either dry rolled oats or whole grain oats that have been soaked in water or fruit juice. Other common ingredients are additional grated or chopped fresh fruit (e.g., bananas, apples, berries, grapes, mango), dried fruit, milk products (e.g., fresh milk, yogurt, cream, condensed milk, fromage frais, quark, cottage cheese, or nondairy milk substitutes), lemon juice, ground nuts, seeds, spices (especially cinnamon), honey and muesli mix.\n\nThe preparation of homemade muesli varies according to the tastes and preferences of the cook, but the basic proportions are around 80% grain, 10% nuts and seeds and 10% dried fruits.\n\nPackaged muesli is a loose mixture of mainly rolled oats or cornflakes together with various dried fruit pieces, nuts, and seeds – the main ingredients of any muesli. It commonly contains other rolled cereal grains such as wheat or rye flakes.\n\nThere are many varieties, which may also contain honey, spices, or chocolate. This dry packaged muesli can be stored for many months and served quickly after mixing with milk, filmjölk, yogurt, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juice, or water. If desired, pieces of fresh fruit may be added. Alternatively, the mix may be soaked overnight in milk and then served with fresh fruit or compote to taste.\n\n"}
{"id": "371698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371698", "title": "Meatloaf", "text": "Meatloaf\n\nMeatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been mixed with other ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed on a flat pan or created by cooking it in a loaf pan. It is usually made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry and seafood are also used.\n\nThe cooked loaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. Because the dish can become dry, various techniques aim to keep the dish moist by either covering it with sauce or wrapping it, using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, or filling it with meats, cheese, or other vegetables.\n\nMeatloaf of minced meat was mentioned in the Roman cookery collection \"Apicius\" as early as the 5th century. Meatloaf is a traditional German, Scandinavian and Belgian dish, and it is a cousin to the Dutch meatball. American meatloaf has its origins in scrapple, a mixture of ground pork and cornmeal served by German-Americans in Pennsylvania since colonial times. Meatloaf in the contemporary American sense did not appear in cookbooks until the late 19th century.\n\nIn Argentina it is usually called \"Pan de carne\". It is typically filled with ham, cheese, and carrots (or some other vegetable).\n\nThe Austrian meatloaf version is called \"Faschierter Braten\". Most of the time it is not filled (e.g., in Germany), but it is wrapped in ham before baking it. Often it is served with mashed potatoes (when warm) or with sauce cumberland (when cold).\n\nThe Belgian version of meatloaf is called \"vleesbrood\" (meatbread) in Dutch and \"pain de viande\" in French. It is usually served warm and can then be served with various sauces, but can also be eaten cold with a loaf of bread.\n\n\"Rulo Stefani\" (). The Bulgarian \"rulo Stefani\" meatloaf is similar to the Hungarian \"Stefánia\" meatloaf, with hard-boiled eggs in the middle.\n\nChilean meatloaf, known as \"Asado Aleman\" (German roasted meat) is a staple of southern Chile cuisine, especially in areas known for having been influenced by the arrival of German settlers during the 18th and 19th century. The most common recipe nowadays consists of ground beef, carrots, sausages, boiled eggs and breadcrumbs, cooked on the oven and normally served with a side-dish of mashed potatoes or rice.\n\nThe Cuban meatloaf is called \"pulpeta\". It is made with ground beef and ground ham, and stuffed with hard boiled eggs, and it is cooked on the stovetop. The dish was brought to public attention, mistakenly referred to as a sausage, in the second episode of the third season of \"The Cosby Show\" entitled \"Food for Thought\".\n\nIn the Czech Republic, meatloaf is referred to as \"sekaná\" ('chopped'). It is optional to put hard boiled eggs, gherkins, or wienerwurst inside.\n\nDanish meatloaf is called \"forloren hare\" 'mock hare' or \"farsbrød\" 'ground-meat bread' and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef with strips of bacon or cubed bacon on top. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes and brown sauce sweetened with red currant jam.\n\nFinnish meatloaf is called \"lihamureke\". It is completely based on the basic meatball recipe. The only spices used are salt and pepper. It is not customary to stuff \"lihamureke\" with anything. The usual side dish is mashed potatoes, and \"lihamureke\" is usually served with brown sauce.\n\nIn Germany, meatloaf is referred to as \"Hackbraten\", \"Faschierter Braten\" or \"Falscher Hase\" 'mock hare'. In some regions it often has boiled eggs inside.\n\nIn Greece, meatloaf is referred to as \"rolo\" (Ρολό) and it is usually filled with hard boiled eggs, although several other variations exist.\n\nStefania meatloaf () or Stefania slices are a type of Hungarian long meatloaf baked in a loaf pan, with 3 hard boiled eggs in the middle, making decorative white and yellow rings in the middle of the slices.\n\nIn Italy, meatloaf is called \"polpettone\" and can be filled with eggs, ham and cheese and other ingredients.\n\nIn Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, meatloaf is called \"Klops\" () and can be served cold or hot. It is sometimes filled with whole boiled eggs. The name presumably comes from German \"Klops\" 'meatball'.\n\nIn Lebanon, \"kibbeh\" (ground beef or lamb mixed with burgul) can sometimes be formed in a loaf and baked. It is sometimes made from raw meat.\n\n\"Rolat\" is a similar dish to the chiefly Arab, though also Persian and South-Asian, kofta. Ground beef is rolled and cooked until brown. It can be cooked with vegetables and various sauces.\n\nIt is known as \"albondigón\" and has a small size.\n\nхучмал (khoochmal) is served with mashed potatoes cooked over the ground meat.\n\nThe Dutch version of meatloaf is called \"gehaktbrood\" and can be eaten warm or cold. A mini-version of meatloaf called \"slavink\" is also served in the Netherlands.\n\n\"Embutido\" (not to be confused with the Spanish \"embutido\") is made of well-seasoned ground pork, raisins, minced carrots, sausages, and whole boiled eggs. The meat is molded into a roll with the sausages and hard boiled eggs set in the middle. Another variation of the dish involves wrapping the meatloaf with pork crow or mesentery. It is then wrapped in aluminum foil (historically, banana leaves) and steamed for an hour. The cooked \"embutido\" may be stored in freezers. It is usually served fried and sliced for breakfast.\n\n\"Embutido\" is sometimes confused with \"morcón\" (also not to be confused with Spanish \"morcón\"), due to their similarity in appearance. However \"morcón\" is a beef roulade, not a meatloaf.\n\n\"Hardinera\" is a Filipino meatloaf made with diced or ground pork topped with sliced hard-boiled eggs, pineapples, carrots, bell peppers, peas, tomatoes, and raisins, among others.\n\nCalled \"pieczeń rzymska\" (\"Roman roast\") or \"klops\" is made of ground pork and/or beef, onions and garlic, with obligatory hard boiled egg inside.\n\nIn Puerto Rican cuisine, meatloaf is known as \"albondigón\". Puerto Rican style meatloaf is made with ground pork, beef, turkey, adobo, worcestershire sauce, milk, ketchup, potatoes, red beans, breadcrumb, parsley, with a hard-boiled egg in the middle.\n\nIn Romanian cuisine, there is a meatloaf dish called \"drob\", similar to other minced meat dishes in the region like the Bulgarian \"Rulo Stefani\" or the Hungarian \"Stefánia\" meatloaf, the major difference being that it is always made with lamb organs (or a mixture of lamb organs and pork or veal) and the hard boiled eggs in the centre of the \"drob\" are optional.\n\nOne of South Africa's most popular dishes is a form of meatloaf called bobotie. Food in South Africa varies by region, and bobotie is considered a Cape Town or Western Cape dish, but is so popular throughout the country that it is sometimes considered one of South Africa's signature dishes. It is a slightly sweet meatloaf flavored with curry spices, dried apricots and almonds, and is topped with whipped egg and milk topping which when baked on top of the meat filling creates an egg \"topping\". It arrived in South Africa several hundred years ago from the East Indies and became one of the signature dishes of Cape Town's Cape Malay community.\n\nSwedish meatloaf is called \"köttfärslimpa\" and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes, brown sauce and lingonberry jam.\n\nIn the Turkish cuisine there is a meatloaf with vegetables dish called \"dalyan köfte\".\n\nIn the UK there are regional pork meatloaf dishes known as Haslet, which can be eaten cold or hot.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, cooking meatloaf was a way for families to stretch the food budget by using an inexpensive type of meat and leftover ingredients. Along with spices, it was popular to add cereal grains, bread or saltines to the meatloaf to add bulk and stretch the meat. This tradition of additions still lives on, but with new goals: primarily, producing a lower-fat dish with superior binding and consistency.\n\nAmerican-style meatloaf is typically eaten with some kind of sauce or relish, often applied before cooking. Many recipes call for a pasta sauce or tomato sauce to be poured over the loaf, to form a crust during baking. One of these tomato-based sauces may be substituted with a simple brown or onion gravy, or a can of cream of mushroom soup, but the meatloaf is prepared in a similar manner. Barbecue sauce, tomato ketchup, or a mixture of ketchup and prepared mustard may also be used. This style of meatloaf may be topped with a \"meatloaf sauce\" consisting of ketchup and brown sugar. Another variety of meatloaf, in the same style, is prepared by \"frosting\" the loaf with mashed potatoes, drizzling a small amount of butter over the top, and then browning it in the oven.\n\nAmerican-style meatloaf is normally served warm, as part of the main course, but it can also be sliced as a cold cut (and then used in sandwiches). This dish can be considered a typical comfort food in the US, and so it is served in many diners and restaurants. In a 2007 poll by \"Good Housekeeping\", meatloaf was the seventh-favorite dish of Americans.\n\nThe Vietnamese meatloaf version is called \"giò\". It is boiled rather than baked or smoked. There are many versions of \"giò\" that differ by the ingredients used.\n\n"}

{"id": "373096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373096", "title": "Shastra", "text": "Shastra\n\nShastra (, IAST: , ) is a Sanskrit word that means \"precept, rules, manual, compendium, book or treatise\" in a general sense. The word is generally used as a suffix in the Indian literature context, for technical or specialized knowledge in a defined area of practice.\n\n\"Shastra\" has a similar meaning to English \"-logy\", e.g. ecology, psychology, meaning scientific and basic knowledge on particular subject. Examples in terms of modern neologisms include \"bhautikashastra\" \"physics\", \"rasayanashastra\" \"chemistry\", \"jīvashāstra\" \"biology\", \"vastushastra\" \"architectural science\", \"shilpashastra\" \"science of mechanical arts and sculpture\", \"arthashastra\" \"science of politics, economics\" and \"nitishastra\" \"compendium of ethics or right policy\".\n\nIn Western literature, \"Shastra\" is sometimes spelled as Sastra, reflecting a misunderstanding of the IPA symbol ‘ś’, which corresponds to the English ‘sh’.\n\n\"Shastra\" commonly refers to a treatise or text on a specific field of knowledge. In early Vedic literature, the word referred to any precept, rule, teaching, ritual instruction or direction. In late and post Vedic literature of Hinduism, \"Shastra\" referred to any treatise, book or instrument of teaching, any manual or compendium on any subject in any field of knowledge, including religious. It is often a suffix, added to the subject of the treatise, such as Yoga-Shastra, Nyaya-Shastra, Dharma-Shastra, Koka- or Kama-Shastra, Moksha-Shastra, Artha-Shastra, Alamkara-Shastra (rhetoric), Kavya-Shastra (poetics), Sangita-Shastra (music), Natya-Shastra (theatre & dance) and others.\n\nIn Buddhism, a \"shastra\" is often a commentary written at a later date to explain an earlier scripture or sutra. For example, Yutang Lin says that a text written by him and not given by Buddha, cannot be called a \"Sutra\"; it is called a \"Sastra\". In Buddhism, Buddhists are allowed to offer their theses as long as they are consistent with the Sutras, and those are called \"Sastras.\"\n\nIn Jainism, the term means the same as in Hinduism. An example of Jaina Shastra is the 12th-century \"Yoga Shastra of Hemchandracharya\".\n\nShastra is sometimes the root of compounded Sanskrit words. A custodian of \"Shastra\", for example, is called \"Shashtradhari\" (Sanskrit: शास्त्रधारी).\n\nThe term is found in several passages of the Rigveda (2nd millennium BCE), such as in hymn VIII.33.16.\n\nIn this Rigvedic verse, the term means rule or instruction. The Maitri Upanishad (mid to late 1st millennium BCE), similarly, mentions the materialist Charvakas and Brihaspati who disagreed that the Vedas are a treatise of knowledge, proposing relativism instead, in the following passage:\n\nThe term is found in other Upanishads as well as in Bhagavad Gita such as in verses 15.20, 16.23-16.24, and 17.1.\n\nThe ' (11.36; 14.30) uses the term \"Shastra\" to refer to the ' tradition. , and 's ' use the term. Similarly, the ' uses the term to refer to astronomical treatises. The term ', refers to the ' of the \"\"s.\n\nThe term \"'\" is found in Yaska's \"Nirukta\" (1.2, 14), where the reference is to \"Nirukta\" (etymology). An early use of the term ' with reference to the literature on \"dharma\" is found in the ' of , who uses the expression '\n\nShastras are predominantly post-Vedic literature, that is after about 500 BCE. However, it is unclear when various Shastras were composed and completed. The authenticity of the manuscripts is also unclear, as many versions of the same text exist, some with major differences. Patrick Olivelle, credited with a 2005 translation of Manu Dharma-sastra, published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of manuscripts as follows (abridged):\n\nThe literature of late 1st millennium BCE such as Arthashastra, and Shastras of various fields of knowledge from the early 1st millennium period is of great interest as it helped the emergence of diverse schools and the spread of Indian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism in and outside South Asia.\n\nThe shastras are both descriptive and prescriptive. Among the various Shastras, Manu's code of law has been among the most studied as the colonial British government attempted to establish different laws in British India based on Sharia for Muslims and Manu's code of law for all non-Muslims.\n\nThe shastras are not consistent or a single consensus documents. Dharma-sastras, for example, contain opposing views and contradictory theories. This is in part because they represent an ideal of human behaviour, while at the same time recognising the need to account for likely failings. The shastras do not present life as it was lived. Rather they reveal an idea of what life should be, seen from a Brahmin perspective. The shastra texts constitute one of the great bodies of literature of the ancient world.\n\nSutras are another genre of Indian texts that emerged in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly after the 600 BCE. \"Sutra\" (literally \"binding thread\") denotes a distinct type of literary composition from Shastra. In Sanskrit, \"sutra\" typically referred to one or more aphorisms; hence sutras use short, aphoristic, evocative statements. In contrast, a Shastra is typically longer, with more detail and explanations. An example of a Sutra is Patanjali's Yogasutras (considered a classic Hindu treatise), while an example of Shastra is Hemachandra's Yogasastra (considered a classic Svetambara Jain treatise), both on yoga.\n\nShastras and Sutras are among the numerous other genres of literature that has survived from ancient and medieval India. Other genres include Vedas, Upanishads, Vedangas, Itihasa, Puranas, Bhasyas, and Subhashitas.\n"}

The beverages produced by the company, branded as Faygo or Faygo Pop, are distributed in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Southern regions of the United States, as well as southern Canada. Faygo is imported in Europe by American Fizz, an official distributor of Faygo. Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Beverage Corporation and started in Detroit, Michigan, in 1907 as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works.\n\nBen and Perry Feigenson, who developed Faygo, were originally bakers from Russia. Faygo first became available in 1907 in bottles with only three flavors: grape, strawberry, and fruit punch. These flavors were based on the Feigenson brothers' cake-frosting recipes. They charged three cents for one bottle, and five cents for two bottles. The brothers bought their first delivery truck in 1922, and started home deliveries the following year. They also introduced a low-calorie version in the 1960s called Ohana. In the 1980s, they introduced flavored carbonated water.\n\nIn the 1920s as the company expanded, they thought the brand name \"Feigenson Brothers\" was too long and changed it to Faygo. The brothers ran the company until the mid-1960s, when they turned it over to their sons. In 1969, the company created a series of radio and television advertisements featuring a fictional cowboy called the Faygo Kid, who was portrayed in animation for television commercials for Faygo Old-Fashioned Root Beer.\n\nBecause the drink had a limited shelf life, the company only sold its products in Michigan until the late 1950s. Company chemists later resolved this issue by installing a filtration system to remove impurities from the manufacturing plant's water system. In the 1960s, the soda's regional popularity expanded when the company began advertising during broadcasts of Detroit Tigers games. Commercials produced in the 1970s featured \"everyday people\" on a Mexican ferry widely but wrongly thought to be the Boblo Boat singing the \"Faygo Boat Song\". Tree Sweet Products Corp. sold the company to National Beverage Corp. in 1987. In 2007, Faygo celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nFaygo brands were praised in the September 2009 issue of \"Bon Appétit\", ranking Faygo Root Beer as the best-tasting American root beer, describing it as \"dry and crisp, with a frothy head, a good bite and a long finish\".\n\nDetroit-based hip hop group Insane Clown Posse include references to Faygo in several of their songs. Positive audience reaction to an early concert performance in which Violent J threw an open bottle at a row of hecklers resulted in the group continuing to spray their audiences with the drink. They repeated this practice which developed into the Juggalo culture's \"Faygo Showers\". This in turn was referenced in the webcomic \"Homestuck\", in which a character loosely based on Juggalo subculture (Gamzee Makara) is shown drinking it multiple times.\n\nRapper 6 Dogs references Faygo in his song \"Faygo Dreams.\"\n\nRapper Lil Xan makes a reference to Faygo in Diplo's 2018 release \"Color Blind\"\n\nRapper J. Cole sits on a pack of Faygo in the music video for his 2019 release of \"Middle Child.\"\n"}
{"id": "375321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375321", "title": "Nattō", "text": "Nattō\n\nSources differ about the earliest origin of \"nattō\". One theory is that nattō was codeveloped in multiple locations in the distant past, since it is simple to make with ingredients and tools commonly available in Japan since ancient times. There is also the story about Minamoto no Yoshiie, who was on a campaign in northeastern Japan between 1086 AD and 1088 AD, when one day, they were attacked while boiling soybeans for their horses. They hurriedly packed up the beans, and did not open the straw bags until a few days later, by which time the beans had fermented. The soldiers ate it anyway, and liked the taste, so they offered some to Yoshiie, who also liked the taste.\n\nA change in the production of \"nattō\" occurred in the Taishō period (1912–1926), when researchers discovered a way to produce a \"nattō\" starter culture containing \"Bacillus subtilis\" without the need for straw, thereby simplifying the commercial production of \"nattō\" and enabling more consistent results.\n\n\"Nattō\" has a distinctive smell, somewhat akin to a pungent cheese. Stirring \"nattō\" produces lots of sticky strings.\n\n\"Nattō\" is occasionally used in other foods, such as \"nattō\" sushi, \"nattō\" toast, in miso soup, tamagoyaki, salad, as an ingredient in okonomiyaki, or even with spaghetti.\nSometimes soybeans are crushed and fermented. This is called \"hikiwari nattō\".\n\nMany find the taste unpleasant and smelly while others relish it as a delicacy. Nattō is more popular in some areas of Japan than in others. \"Nattō\" is known to be popular in the eastern Kantō region, but less popular in Kansai. A 2009 Internet survey in Japan indicated 70.2% of respondents like \"nattō\" and 29.8% do not, but out of 29.8% who dislike \"nattō\", about half of them eat \"nattō\" for its health benefits.\n\n\"Nattō\" is made from soybeans, typically \"nattō\" soybeans. Smaller beans are preferred, as the fermentation process will be able to reach the center of the bean more easily. The beans are washed and soaked in water for 12 to 20 hours to increase their size. Next, the soybeans are steamed for 6 hours, although a pressure cooker may be used to reduce the time. The beans are mixed with the bacterium \"Bacillus subtilis\", known as \"nattō-kin\" in Japanese. From this point on, care must be taken to keep the ingredients away from impurities and other bacteria. The mixture is fermented at for up to 24 hours. Afterward, the \"nattō\" is cooled, then aged in a refrigerator for up to one week to allow the development of stringiness.\n\nIn \"nattō\"-making facilities, these processing steps have to be done while avoiding incidents in which soybeans are touched by workers. Even though workers use \"B. subtilis natto\" as the starting culture, which can suppress some undesired bacterial growth, workers pay extra-close attention not to introduce skin flora on to soy beans.\n\nTo make \"nattō\" at home, a bacterial culture of \"B. subtilis\" is needed. \"B. subtilis natto\" is weak in lactic acid, so it is important to prevent lactic acid bacteria from breeding. Some \"B. subtilis natto\" varieties that are closer to odorless are usually less active, raising the possibility that minor germs will breed. Bacteriophages are dangerous to \"B. subtilis\".\n\nHistorically, \"nattō\" was made by storing the steamed soybeans in rice straw, which naturally contains \"B. subtilis natto\". The soybeans were packed in straw and left to ferment.\n\nToday's mass-produced \"nattō\" is sold in small polystyrene containers. A typical package contains two, three, or occasionally four containers, each 40 to 50 g. One container typically complements a small bowl of rice.\n\n\"Nattō\" has a different nutritional makeup from raw soy beans, losing Vitamin A and several other vitamins and minerals. The calorie content of \"nattō\" is lower than that of raw soy beans, however. While soy beans are highly nutritious, the nutrition is packed in the bean's hard fiber. \"Nattō\" includes the benefits of nutritious soy and softer dietary fiber without the high sodium content present in many other soy products, notably in miso. \"Nattō\" contains no cholesterol and is a significant source of iron, calcium, magnesium, protein, potassium, vitamins B6, B2, E, K2, and more. When \"nattō\" is mixed with egg and eaten with rice, Japanese call the dish a perfectly nutritious meal, covering all nutritional needs. \"Nattō\" is the richest food source of natural K2. Consumption of it is strongly associated with bone health.\n\nWhen \"B. subtilis natto\" breaks up soy protein, the bacteria create chains of polyglutamic acid, gamma polyglutamic acid. This polypeptide chain is unusual in that the peptide bond is found between the nitrogen and the R-group's carboxyl acid. \"Nattō\" gets its stringiness from the gamma polyglutamic acid. Its odor comes from diacetyl and pyrazines, but if it is allowed to ferment too long, then ammonia is released.\n\nBy mass, \"nattō\" is 55% water, 18% protein, 11% fats, 5% fiber, and 5% sugars.\n\nA serving of \"nattō\" (100g) provides 29% of the Daily value (DV) of Vitamin K2, 22% of the DV for Vitamin C, 76% of the DV for manganese, 48% of the DV for iron, and 22% of the DV for dietary fiber.\n\nMany countries produce similar traditional soybean foods fermented with \"Bacillus subtilis\", such as \"shuǐdòuchǐ\" (水豆豉) of China, \"cheonggukjang\" (청국장) of Korea, \"thuanao\" (ถั่วเน่า) of Thailand, \"kinema\" of Nepal and the Himalayan regions of West Bengal and Sikkim, \"tungrymbai\" of Meghalaya, \"hawaijaar\" of Manipur, \"bekang um\" of Mizoram, \"akhuni\" of Nagaland, and \"piak\" of Arunachal Pradesh, India.\n\nIn addition, certain West African bean products are fermented with the bacillus, including \"dawadawa\", \"sumbala\", and \"iru\", made from néré seeds or soybeans, and \"ogiri\", made from sesame or melon seeds.\n\n"}

Wooton obtained patents for his design and established a company in 1870. Production continued until about 1884. The Wooton desk is their better known secretary desk; the Wooton desk company also produced a so-called rotary desk, which is in fact a pedestal desk whose pedestals have segments which turn on themselves to expose more drawers and nooks.\n\nThe Wooton desk was introduced at the end of the 19th century, at a time when office work was changing in a drastic fashion with an increase in paperwork that led to the introduction of filing cabinets, among other things. The white-collar worker invaded the office in huge numbers. The new reservoir-based fountain pen and the typewriter were used to produce greater quantities of office documents than ever before. In this context desks which required users to fold and title each letter or document and place it in a pigeon hole, or small nook, were simply not efficient. It was faster to place an unfolded piece of paper in a folder and place the folder in a file cabinet or file drawer.\nWooton desks in good condition are sometimes sold in auctions for the same price as a top-of-the-line luxury automobile.\n\nWooton desks were probably not the costliest desks in series production, but they were possibly the ones with the most drawers, nooks and crannies imaginable. Only a few examples of the cupboard desk had more divisions, but they were of a very utilitarian different style, and were often produced by the very families or communities which used them, such as the Shakers. The armoire desk is the closest modern relative to the Wooton desk in its size and form. But the armoire desk is even bigger and larger than the Wooton, and despite the use of rich veneers by some makers, it is a much more practical piece of furniture.\n\nThe Wooton secretary desk usually rests on a four-legged quadruped support equipped with casters. The main body of the desk is filled with a dozen or several dozens (depending on the model) of small drawers and nooks for papers and small objects.\n\nAs in a \"secretaire a abattant\" or in a fall front desk the main working surface or desktop is hinged and lifted completely from the horizontal to the vertical in order to lock up the desk, forcing the user to gather up and store all papers and implements beforehand. Unlike the secretaire a abattant however, the Wooton desktop hides only a few of the small drawers and nooks. The real lockup is done by closing two massive hinged panels which are themselves as deep as the desk and are like it filled with small drawers and nooks of all sizes.\n\n\n"}

Rising to the front of orthodox medical practice in the \"Age of Heroic Medicine\" (1780–1850), it fell out of favor in the mid-19th century as more gentle, palliative treatments became the norm.\n\nPockets of medical methodology that can be classified as \"heroic\" appear in the early 17th century with Parisian physician Guy Patin and French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger. Patin, nicknamed \"Le Grand Saigneur\" (the Grand Bloodletter), was infamous for his rigorous procedure plans, which included intensive courses of bloodletting and application of senna. Because heroic medicine used popular techniques, it is difficult to absolutely classify a healer's therapeutic epistemology as heroic. Intensive bloodletting treatments can be identified throughout American history, with William Douglass in Massachusetts advocating for a heroic treatment plan in the early 18th century. While there were practitioners here and there who were particularly eager to perform aggressive treatment, heroic medicine did not become a concentrated school of thought until later in the 18th century.\n\nMany associate Benjamin Rush with an abrupt acceptance of heroic techniques into the realm of mainstream medicine, especially in America. Founding father, creator of University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, and known as the \"American Hippocrates,\" Rush was well respected and revered in the medical field. The Philadelphia Yellow Fever outbreak in 1793 is looked upon as a major event in the merging of heroic medicine into the course of best practices in the medical profession. Much of the city was left incapacitated by the rampant epidemic. As healers fled the city, Rush bravely remained to treat people, and ultimately himself, with drastic regimens of intensive bloodlettings and purgatives. He taught many students who then carried the tradition to other parts of the United States. Varied in its influence, heroic medicine was particularly concentrated around Pennsylvania and spread into other locations. The term \"heroic medicine\" was coined later in the mid-19th century to describe extreme treatment.\n\nHeroic medicine was used to treat George Washington on his deathbed in 1799. He was bled repeatedly and given Mercury(I) chloride (calomel) and several blisters of cantharidin to induce sweating. Washington died shortly after receiving this rigorous heroic treatment.\n\nHeroic medicine was very much in the hands of the professional, as the invasive interventions involved were beyond the capabilities of rustic practitioners. Symptoms were not regarded as the body's attempt to fight the disease, but were considered a complication that would exacerbate the patient's condition and do further harm. Practitioners believed that a fever should be suppressed and any drugs used should be powerful and given in large dosages. Under this onslaught, domestic medicine dwindled in importance; even treatments that had been found effective in the past were relegated to the realms of old-fashioned folk medicine.\n\nHeroic medicine does not have a definitive start date, as its treatments themselves were not new to the field of medicine. Bloodletting, purging, and sweating are cemented firmly in medical tradition back to the advent of humoral theory in the time of Hippocrates and Galen. With hopes of rebalancing the body's delicate homeostasis of four humors – black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood – the careful manipulation of bodily discharge, like bleeding and evacuation, was believed to nudge the body back to its healthy, natural state. The physician's role was always to monitor the path of the body's humoral levels back to normal.\n\nHeroic medicine takes this methodology to the extreme, draining significant volumes of blood and ordering intensive regimens of evacuation. It was not uncommon for physicians to strive to drain up to 80 percent of a patient's blood volume. Likewise, dramatic evacuations, both by pharmacological emetics and laxatives, induced the forceful removal of bodily fluid. Commonly used emetics include senna and tartar emetic. General intestinal cleansing was instigated by massive doses of calomel, to the point of acute mercury poisoning. Sweating was also induced using blisters of cantharidin and diaphoretic.\n\nHeroic medicine became less favoured with the rise of safer placebos such as hydrotherapy and homeopathy. Even during its heyday, heroic medicine faced criticism from physicians and alternative medicine healers, who pushed for more natural cures.\n\nWhile it is easy to discuss and question the ethical implications of such a severe course of treatment, it is important to remember that in that time period physicians were operating under their best understanding of the body and its physiology. There were dissenting voices at the time, but heroic medicine remained an important, legitimate part of the medical tradition in that era.\n\n"}

To prepare dishes similar to those they had back home in the old country the pioneers were very inventive. Colonial goose is now a recognised classic, with some restaurants featuring it as a main attraction at midwinter festivities (21 June in New Zealand). \n\nIt involves the careful boning out of a leg of lamb, stuffing it with honey and dried apricots, in addition to traditional stuffing based on breadcrumbs, onion, parsley and thyme or sage, and then marinating it in a red wine-based marinade which gives it the appearance of goose when cooked.\n\n"}
{"id": "382599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382599", "title": "Convenience food", "text": "Convenience food\n\nConvenience food, or tertiary processed food, is food that is commercially prepared (often through processing) to optimise ease of consumption. Such food is usually ready to eat without further preparation. It may also be easily portable, have a long shelf life, or offer a combination of such convenient traits. Although restaurant meals meet this definition, the term is seldom applied to them. Convenience foods include ready-to-eat dry products, frozen foods such as TV dinners, shelf-stable foods, prepared mixes such as cake mix, and snack foods.\n\nBread, cheese, salted food and other prepared foods have been sold for thousands of years. Other kinds were developed with improvements in food technology. Types of convenience foods can vary by country and geographic region. Some convenience foods have received criticism due to concerns about nutritional content and how their packaging may increase solid waste in landfills. Various methods are used to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight childhood obesity.\n\nConvenience food is commercially prepared for ease of consumption. Products designated as convenience food are often sold as hot, ready-to-eat dishes; as room-temperature, shelf-stable products; or as refrigerated or frozen food products that require minimal preparation (typically just heating) Convenience foods have also been described as foods that have been created to \"make them more appealing to the consumer.\" Convenience foods and restaurants are similar in that they save time. They differ in that restaurant food is ready to eat, whilst convenience food usually requires rudimentary preparation. Both typically cost more money and less time compared to home cooking from scratch.\n\nThroughout history, people have bought food from bakeries, creameries, butcher shops and other commercial processors to save time and effort. The Aztec people of Central Mexico utilized several convenience foods that required only adding water for preparation, which were used by travelers. Cornmeal that was ground and dried, referred to as \"pinolli\", was used by travelers as a convenience food in this manner.\n\nCanned food was developed in the 19th century, primarily for military use, and became more popular during World War I. The expansion of canning depended significantly upon the development of a machine for producing large quantities of cans very cheaply. Before the 1850s, making a can for food required a skilled tinsmith; afterwards, an unskilled laborer, operating a can-making machine, could produce 15 times as many cans each day.\n\nOne of the earliest industrial-scale processed foods was meatpacking. After the invention of a system of refrigerator cars in 1878, meat could be raised, slaughtered, and butchered hundreds (later thousands) of miles or kilometers away from the consumer.\n\nExperience in World War II contributed to the development of frozen foods and the frozen food industry. Modern convenience food saw its beginnings in the United States during the period that began after World War II. Many of these products had their origins in military-developed foods designed for storage longevity and ease of preparation in the battle field. Following the war, several commercial food companies had leftover manufacturing facilities, and some of these companies created new freeze-dried and canned foods for home use. Like many product introductions, not all were successful—convenience food staples such as fish sticks and canned peaches were counterbalanced by failures such as ham sticks and cheeseburgers-in-a-can. However, this new focus on convenience foods and the use of technology in the kitchen alleviated labor that was traditionally carried out by women, and therefore meals that could be prepared quickly enabled women to exercise more control over their time.\nAs of the 2010s due to increased preference for fresh, \"natural\", whole, and organic food and health concerns the acceptability of processed food to consumers in the United States was dropping and the reputation of major packaged food brands had been damaged. Firms responded by offering \"healthier\" formulations and acquisition of brands with better reputations.\n\nConvenience foods can include products such as candy; beverages such as soft drinks, juices and milk; nuts, fruits and vegetables in fresh or preserved states; processed meats and cheeses; and canned products such as soups and pasta dishes. Additional convenience foods include frozen pizza, chips such as potato chips, pretzels, and cookies.\n\nThese products are often sold in portion-controlled, single-serving packaging designed for portability.\n\nGristmills have produced flour for baking for thousands of years. In more recent times flour has been sold with other ingredients mixed in, as have other products ready to cook. Packaged mixes are convenience foods which typically require some preparation and cooking either in the oven or on the stove top.\n\nPackaged baked goods mixes typically use chemical leaveners (commonly referred to as baking powder), for a quick, reliable result, avoiding the requirement for time-consuming skilled labor and the climate control needed for traditional yeast breads. These packaged mixes produce a type of quickbread.\n\nExamples include cake mixes, macaroni and cheese, brownie mixes, and gravy mixes. Some packaged mixes may have a high saturated fat content.\n\nIn 2007 it was noted in the book \"Australia's food & nutrition 2012\" that a distinct increase in convenience food consumption had been occurring in Australia.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, breakfast rolls eaten by busy workers became a symbol of the Celtic Tiger economic boom.\n\nIn Japan, onigiri (rice balls) are a popular convenience food that dates for millennia — by the Heian period these were established enough to be mentioned in literature. Additional Japanese convenience foods include prepared tofu (bean curd), prepared packages of seafood and instant ramen noodles.\n\nCanned tuna packed in oil is a convenience food in the Solomon Islands.\n\nIn Russia, frozen pelmeni, a type of meat dumplings, adopted from the Finno-Ugric Uralian peoples such as Komi, Mansi and Udmurts, are known from at least the 18th century, and industrially produced and prepacked pelmeni are a staple of the supermarket freezer sections.\n\nIn Western Africa, processed cassava flour that has been grated and dried is a popular convenience food.\n\nIn some instances, retail sales of convenience foods may provide higher profit margins for food retailers compared to the profits attained from sales of the individual ingredients that are present in the convenience foods.\n\nA survey in 1984 attributed over one-third of funds spent by consumers for food in Great Britain to be for convenience food purchases.\n\nSeveral groups have cited the environmental harm of single serve packaging due to the increased usage of plastics that contributes to solid waste in landfills. Due to concerns about obesity and other health problems, some health organizations have criticized the high fat, sugar, salt, food preservatives and food additives that are present in some convenience foods.\n\nIn most developed countries, 80% of consumed salt comes from industry-prepared food (5% come from natural salt; 15% comes from salt added during cooking or eating). Health effects of salt concentrate on sodium and depend in part on how much is consumed. A single serving of many convenience foods contains a significant portion of the recommended daily allowance of sodium. Manufacturers are concerned that if the taste of their product is not optimized with salt, it will not sell as well as competing products. Tests have shown that some popular packaged foods depend on significant amounts of salt for their palatability.\n\nIn response to the issues surrounding the healthfulness of convenience and restaurant foods, an initiative in the United States, spearheaded by Michelle Obama and her \"Let's Move!\" campaign, to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight childhood obesity, was unveiled by the White House in February 2010. Mrs. Obama has pushed the industry to cut back on sugars and salts found in many convenience foods, encouraging self-regulation over government intervention through laws and regulations. Despite Mrs. Obama's stated preference on self-regulation, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it was looking into quantifying the guidelines into law while other groups and municipalities are seeking to add other preventative measures such as target taxes and levies onto these products.\n\nIn response to the attention, in April 2010 a coalition of sixteen manufactures all agreed to reduce salt levels in foods sold in the United States under a program based on a similar effort in the United Kingdom. However, the initiative has met with resistance from some manufacturers, who claim that processed foods require the current high levels of salt to remain appetizing and to mask undesirable effects of food processing such as \"warmed-over flavor\". The coalition expanded its mission in May 2010 by announcing that it intends to reduce the amount of calories in foods. By introducing lower calorie foods, changing product recipes and reducing portion sizes, the coalition stated that it expected to reduce the caloric content of foods by more than 1.5 trillion calories in total by 2012.\n\nAs previously stated, convenience foods cover a variety of food groups and come in numerous forms. Thus, there are a variety of healthy and unhealthy convenience foods. Research such as the 2002 study by Kimberly Morland et al., have correlated inequalities between low-income communities and increased access to unhealthy convenience foods. Comparing low-income communities to more affluent communities, there are four times more supermarkets located in white communities than the black communities (commonly found in food deserts). As a result, the 2002 study concluded that with limited access to healthy food options in supermarkets, members with in the low-income and minority communities have unequal access. A 2010 study by Dharma E. Cortes et al. also found a connection between consumption of unhealthy convenience food and minority communities. Limited access to healthy food options have resulted in an increase in obesity amongst members in these communities.\n\nMany low-income families struggle with buying fresh fruits and vegetables and nutritional meals for their families because of the price of the products. These families are most often located in food deserts and fresh food is not readily available in their community. Thus, families resort to buying food that is high in fat, sugar, and salt because these highly processed options are inexpensive. These highly processed foods make up a significant portion of unhealthy convenience foods.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "383510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383510", "title": "Ovaltine", "text": "Ovaltine\n\nOvaltine (Ovomaltine) is a brand of milk flavoring product made with malt extract (except in the blue packaging in the United States), sugar (except in Switzerland), and whey. Some flavors also have cocoa. Ovaltine, a registered trademark of Associated British Foods, is made by Wander AG, a subsidiary of Twinings, which acquired the brand from Novartis in 2002, except in the United States, where Nestlé acquired the rights separately from Novartis later on.\n\nOvaltine was developed in Bern, Switzerland, where it is known by its original name, Ovomaltine (from \"ovum\", Latin for \"egg\", and \"malt,\" which were originally its main ingredients). Soon after its invention, the factory moved out to the village of Neuenegg, a few kilometres west of Bern, where it is still produced.\n\nOvomaltine was exported to Britain in 1909. A misspelling of the name on the trademark registration application led to the name being shortened to \"Ovaltine\" in English-speaking markets. A factory was built in Kings Langley, which exported it to the United States as well. By 1915, Ovaltine was being manufactured in Villa Park, Illinois, for the U.S. market. Ovaltine was later manufactured in Peterborough, Ontario, for distribution in Canada. Gerald Ethelbert Goldsmith was the president of the Ovaltine Foods at this time. \n\nOriginally advertised as consisting solely of \"malt, milk, eggs, flavoured with cocoa\", the formulation has changed over the decades, and today several formulations are sold in different parts of the world. In India and UK, it no longer contains eggs.\n\nThe popular chocolate malt version is a powder which is mixed with hot or cold milk as a beverage. \"Malt\" Ovaltine (a version without cocoa) and \"Rich Chocolate\" Ovaltine (a version without malt) are also available in some markets. Ovaltine has also been available in the form of chocolate bars, chocolate Easter eggs, parfait, cookies, and breakfast cereals.\n\nOvaltine also manufactured PDQ Chocolate Flavor Beads, PDQ Choco Chips, and Eggnog Flavored PDQ, which are no longer available. These drink mixes were very popular from the 1960s to the 1980s. Ovaltine discontinued the PDQ products around 1996.\n\nThe U.S. children's radio series \"Little Orphan Annie\" (1931–1940) and \"Captain Midnight\" (1938–1949), and the subsequent \"Captain Midnight\" TV series (1954–1956), were sponsored by Ovaltine. They had promotions in which listeners could save proofs-of-purchase from Ovaltine jars to obtain radio premiums, such as \"secret decoder ring\" badges, or pins that could be used to decode messages in the program. Children from the time may remember that \"Ovaltine\" is an anagram for \"Vital One\".\n\nJean Shepherd offered a humorous (and slightly satirical) look back at the \"Little Orphan Annie Secret Circle\", a club open only to children who had obtained the current Ovaltine decoder, in his story \"The Counterfeit Secret Circle Member Gets The Message, or The Asp Strikes Again.\" The story was dramatized as an episode in the movie A Christmas Story.\n\nAnother radio program aimed at five- to fourteen-year-olds, \"The League of Ovaltineys\", was broadcast to Great Britain by Radio Luxembourg on Sunday evenings at 5:30 PM. Beginning in February 1935, it was broadcast until September 1939, when the outbreak of World War II forced closure of the station, and again after the war from 1952. Like with the U.S. program, listeners could obtain badges, pins, and secret codes. The Ovaltineys' advertising jingle was regarded as one of the most successful jingles of the era, and featured the popular English singing trio The Beverley Sisters.\n\nVilla Park, Illinois, was home to the Ovaltine factory in the United States from 1917 until the company's purchase and withdrawal in 1988. The Villa Park Historical Society maintains a permanent exhibit of Ovaltine advertising and memorabilia. The old factory was converted to loft apartments keeping the original floors and wall exposed.\n\nIn 1992, Himmel Group obtained the right to make and sell Ovaltine in the U.S. from Sandoz Nutrition Corporation. In 2007, Himmel sold their rights to Novartis. As of 2007, Nestlé had acquired Novartis' medical nutrition division and has the rights to Ovaltine. With this purchase, Nestlé immediately ceased Ovaltine's previous television advertising campaign targeted to older and nostalgic audiences, where Ovaltine was presented as more nutritious than former competitor Nesquik, and though it is still sold widely in the United States, Ovaltine is currently not advertised on American television.\n\nOvaltine was very popular in Britain, and was manufactured at Kings Langley in Hertfordshire using a process that included GEA Wiegand falling film evaporators to concentrate liquid malt extract which was then dried under vacuum in steam heated band dryers. The art deco style Ovaltine factory in Kings Langley is a well-known local landmark. Production ceased in 2002 and the factory has now been redeveloped as luxury flats. Near the factory was a health farm run by the Ovaltine works which was set up as a model farm and a health resort for disadvantaged children, which operated until the 1960s. Later, the farm land was sold and is now largely occupied by the M25 motorway. The Ovaltine Egg Farm is now the site of Renewable Energy Systems Ltd. and the site of the first wind turbine visible from the M25.\n\nIn October 2002, the food and drinks division of Novartis, the maker of Ovaltine, was bought by Associated British Foods. ABF currently produces Ovaltine in Switzerland, China, Thailand and Australia. In the United States Nestlé manufactures Ovaltine.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Ovaltine, like Horlicks, is known as a café drink. It is served at \"cha chaan tengs\" as well as fast-food shops such as Café de Coral and Maxim's Express. It is served hot, or on ice as a cold drink. In Brazil, it is commonly mixed with vanilla ice cream. In the Asian market, it is a chocolate ice cream flavoured with Ovaltine powder. The Ovomaltine brand is highly recognizable in Switzerland, and the brand is associated with skiing and snowboarding. The McCafé in Hong Kong provides \"Ovaltine Crunchy Latte\" and other drinks and desserts.\n\nIn Malaysia, Ovaltine has lost its popularity to Nestlé Milo. Ovaltine is sold in Tetra Pak cartons for cold serving and widely available in shops and supermarkets, yet it has a low profile compared to similar beverages in the market. In Japan, Ovaltine was sold for a short period in the late 1970s by Calpis Industries (presently Calpis Co., Ltd.), but it was not a commercial success. In Australia, Ovalteenies are sold as round tablets of compressed Ovaltine, eaten as candy.\n\nBrazilian fast-food chain Bob's, the largest competitor to McDonald's in that country, offered, since 1959, milkshakes and sundaes made with Ovaltine, where it goes by the name of \"Ovomaltine\", which became a flagship product of the fast-food chain in Brazil. In 2016, McDonald's acquired exclusive rights to sell \"Ovomaltine\"-branded milkshakes. Brazil has the second largest Ovaltine factory, in São Paulo, and is the second largest consumer market for the product, after Thailand. The Brazilian Ovaltine is unlike any other in the world, originating from an assembly line malfunction that made the powder crispier that is still maintained today.\n\nIn 2011, Ovaltine was banned in Denmark under legislation forbidding the sale of food products with added vitamins unless claims are proven to the satisfaction of Denmark. In 2014 this was reversed.\n\n\n"}

There are English and continental European recipes dating to the late 15th or early 16th century, where it can be found in a Dutch recipe collection. It has been suggested that \"snow\" may be even older than that.\n\nThe common ingredients for early recipes are cream, rosewater and sugar, whipped until stiff. Other flavouring agents, e.g., cloves or ginger, are also known from various recipes. It is the process of whipping cream until stiff that is often likened to snow as can be seen in passages such as \"\"Beat your cream with a stick until the Snow rises ...\"\". It was often draped over another item to give the appearance of snow having fallen over the item.\n\nThe origins of the snow-based dessert by this name are hard to verify, but the technique of using snow as a main ingredient in a dessert is very old. Common ingredients for this variety are a dairy based ingredient, sugar and a flavouring agent. In adding a small amount of dairy-based liquid and a flavouring agent (similar to ice cream ingredients) into clean snow, the snow melts and congeals into a simple ice cream substitute.\n\nApple snow, with puréed apple added to the basic recipe, was popular served hot in the 17th century while a more modern version is eaten cold. Fruit juice contents were also used in lemon and orange snow. There is a Russian version that is called air pie, which is egg white, sugar, and fruit pureé, whipped and served hot.\n\nSummer snow is known as a version with fruit content, egg whites and alcohol.\n\nSnowballs can be a variety of desserts. They are usually not related to snow cream desserts. One of these, which is more commonly known as slush, and is based on ice and fruit syrup, can be seen as related to Snow Cream.\n\nA snow cone or sno cone is a frozen dessert made of crushed or shaved ice, flavored with brightly colored syrup, usually fruit-flavored, served in a paper cone or cup.\n\n"}

As they stepped outside of the sipapu, they changed from lizard-like beings into homo sapiens, or human form (See Waters, 1963, and later reprints; Courlander, 1971). It is from this point that the \"First Peoples\" of the Earth began to divide and separate, creating differing tribes along the first journeys of the first humans.

{"id": "384375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384375", "title": "Fanta", "text": "Fanta\n\nFanta is a brand of fruit-flavored carbonated drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company and marketed globally. There are more than 100 flavours worldwide. The Fanta drink originated as a cola substitute in Nazi Germany under a World War II trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.\n\nDuring WWII, a trade embargo was established against Nazi Germany—making the import of Coca-Cola syrup difficult. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace—the \"\"leftovers of leftovers\"\", as Keith later recalled. The name was the result of a brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to \"use their imagination\" (\"Fantasie\" in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, retorted \"Fanta!\"\n\nThe plant was cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, The Coca-Cola Company regained control of the plant, formula, and the trademarks to the new Fanta product—as well as the plant profits made during the war.\n\nDuring the war the Dutch Coca-Cola plant in Amsterdam (N.V. Nederlandsche Coca-Cola Maatschappij) suffered the same difficulties as the German Coca-Cola plant. Max Keith put the Fanta brand at the disposal of the Dutch Coca-Cola plant, of which he had been appointed the official caretaker. Dutch Fanta had a different recipe from German Fanta, elderberries being one of the main ingredients.\n\nFanta production was discontinued when the German and Dutch Coca-Cola branches were reunited with their parent company. Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola relaunched Fanta in 1955. The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.\n\nThe orange Fanta that we know today was produced for the first time in Italy, in Naples, in 1955, when a local bottling plant started producing it using locally sourced oranges.\n\nFanta is known for its upbeat colorful advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris created the tagline \"\"Wanta Fanta!\"\" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from mid-2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign.\n\nIn February 2015, a 75th-anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original wartime flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as \"less sweet\" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back \"the feeling of the Good Old Times\" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.\n\nThere are more than 90 flavors worldwide. In Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Turkey, Sweden and some other countries, there is \"\"Fanta Shokata\"\" (a wordplay between \"\"soc\"\" -elderberry in Romanian- and \"\"shock\"\") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socată), Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.\n\nOrange Fanta is also available in Canada; the formula differs from its American counterpart in that it contains orange juice and the American version contains none. The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with grape juice.\n\nPrimary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Sunkist, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Faygo, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.\n\nIn New Zealand, unlike the rest of Australasia, Fanta is visually branded with the original logo used since 2008. The New Zealand market includes the Fanta variants Fanta Blueberry, Fanta Sour Watermelon and Fanta Strawberry Sherbet.\n\n\n"}

The London department store Fortnum & Mason claims to have invented Scotch eggs in 1851 but the name for the snack was supposedly derived from a nickname used by Londoners who lived around Wellington Barracks after Officers of the Scots Guards stationed there developed a taste for the snack. According to \"Culinary Delights of Yorkshire\", they originated in Whitby, Yorkshire, England, in the 19th century, and were originally covered in fish paste rather than sausage meat. They were supposedly named after William J. Scott & Sons, a well-known eatery which sold them. It has also been suggested that they were originally called \"scorch\" eggs, as they were cooked over an open flame. Other writers have noted similarities to a Mughlai dish called \"nargisi kofta\" (\"Narcissus meatballs\") and an Algerian dish.\n\nThe earliest printed recipe appears in the 1809 edition of Maria Rundell's \"A New System of Domestic Cookery.\" Rundell, as well as other 19th-century authors, served them hot with gravy.\n\nScotch eggs are a common picnic food. In the United Kingdom packaged Scotch eggs are available in supermarkets, corner shops and motorway service stations. Miniature versions are also widely available, sold as \"mini scotch eggs\" \"savoury eggs\", \"picnic eggs\", \"party eggs\", \"snack eggs\", \"egg bites\" or similar. These contain chopped egg or a quail's egg, rather than a whole chicken egg, and sometimes contain mayonnaise or chopped bacon.\n\nIn the United States, many \"British-style\" pubs and eateries serve Scotch eggs, usually served hot with dipping sauces such as ranch dressing, hot sauce, or hot mustard sauce. At the Minnesota State Fair Scotch eggs are served on a stick. Scotch eggs are available at most Renaissance Festivals across the US.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, Scotch eggs may also be called \"vogelnestje\" (\"little bird's nest\"), because they contain an egg, or \"eierbal\" (\"eggball\").\n\nSeveral local variations exist. The Manchester Egg uses a pickled egg wrapped in a mixture of pork meat and Lancashire black pudding, and the Worcester Egg uses an egg pickled in Worcestershire sauce and clad in a mixture of local sausage meat and white pudding.\n\n"}

Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers.\n\nThe gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American cowboy (\"vaquero\" in Spanish), the Chilean \"huaso\", the Peruvian \"chalan\" or \"morochuco\", the Venezuelan or Colombian \"llanero\", the Hawaiian \"paniolo\", the Mexican \"charro\" or the Portuguese \"campino\".\n\nAccording to the \"Diccionario de la lengua española\", in its historical sense a gaucho was \"a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay, and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work\" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply \"A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming\". \nBecause historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean \"Noble, brave and generous\", but also \"One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty\". In Portuguese the word \"gaúcho\" (note the accent) means \"An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses\"; and in Brazil \"gaúcho\" has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. In its purest sense, \"gaucho\" referred to the nomadic, often outlaw inhabitants of the great plains of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. In current usage, \"gaucho\" usually designates the rural working class in general.\"\n\nThere are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the term. It may derive from the Spanish term , in turn derived from a Turkish low-rank military term Chiaus (), through Arabic which became broadly applied to any guard/watcher or aide. The first recorded use of the term dates to Argentine independence in 1816. Another scenario indicates the word may derive from the Portuguese , which was designated to the inhabitants of the vast regions of and in the 18th century or the Portuguese that points to an instrument used by the gauchos to trap and hamstring cattle. The 18th century chronicler speaks of when it mentions the gauchos or as poorly dressed men.\n\nAnother plausible origin is from a South American indigenous language, such as Mapudungun (\"vagrant\", \"wanderer\"), (\"friend\"), or Quechua (\"vagabond\", \"poor person\"). It could also derive from Arabic , which means the state of being lonely in the wilderness.\n\nAn essential attribute of a gaucho was that he was a skilled horseman. \"He has taken his first lessons in riding before he is well able to walk\". Without a horse the gaucho felt himself unmanned. The naturalist William Henry Hudson (who was born on the pampas of Buenos Aires province) recorded that the gauchos of his childhood used to say that a man without a horse was a man without legs. He described meeting a blind gaucho who was obliged to beg for his food yet behaved with dignity and went about on horseback. Richard W. Slatta, the author of a scholarly work about gauchos, notes that the gaucho used horses to collect, mark, drive or tame cattle, to draw fishing nets, to hunt ostriches, to snare partridges, to draw well water, and even − with the help of his friends − to ride to his own burial.\n\nBy reputation the quintessential gaucho caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas could throw his hat on the ground and scoop it up while galloping his horse, without touching the saddle with his hand. For the gaucho, the horse was absolutely essential to his survival for, said Hudson: \"he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils\".\n\nA popular \"copla\" was:\nIt was the gaucho's passion to own all his steeds in matching colours. Hudson recalled: The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla — his own half a dozen or a dozen or more saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds.\n\nThe caudillo El Chacho Peñalosa described the low point of his life as \"In Chile − and on foot!\" (\"En Chile y a pie\".)\n\nThe gaucho plays an important symbolic role in the nationalist feelings of this region, especially that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The epic poem \"Martín Fierro\" by José Hernández (considered by some the national epic of Argentina) used the gaucho as a symbol against corruption and of Argentine national tradition, pitted against Europeanising tendencies. Martín Fierro, the hero of the poem, is drafted into the Argentine military for a border war, deserts, and becomes an outlaw and fugitive. The image of the free gaucho is often contrasted to the slaves who worked the northern Brazilian lands. Further literary descriptions are found in Ricardo Güiraldes' \"Don Segundo Sombra\".\nLike the North American cowboys, as discussed in Richard W. Slatta, \"Cowboys of the Americas\", gauchos were generally reputed to be strong, honest, silent types, but proud and capable of violence when provoked. The gaucho tendency to violence over petty matters is also recognized as a typical trait. Gauchos' use of the famous \"facón\" (large knife generally tucked into the rear of the gaucho sash) is legendary, often associated with considerable bloodletting. Historically, the facón was typically the only eating instrument that a gaucho carried.\n\nAlso like the cowboy, as shown in Richard W. Slatta, \"Cowboys of the Americas\", gauchos were and remain proud and great horseriders. Typically, a gaucho's horse constituted most of what he owned in the world. During the wars of the 19th century in the Southern Cone, the cavalries on all sides were composed almost entirely of gauchos. In Argentina, gaucho armies such as that of Martín Miguel de Güemes, slowed Spanish advances. Furthermore, many caudillos relied on gaucho armies to control the Argentine provinces.\n\nThe gaucho diet was composed almost entirely of beef while on the range, supplemented by \"yerba mate\" (\"erva-mate\" in Portuguese), an herbal infusion made from the leaves of a South American tree, a type of holly rich in caffeine and nutrients.\n\nGauchos dressed quite distinctly from North American cowboys, and used \"bolas\" or \"boleadoras\" - in Portuguese \"boleadeiras\" - (three leather bound rocks tied together with approximately three feet long leather straps) in addition to the familiar \"North American\" lariat or riata. The typical gaucho outfit would include a \"poncho\" (which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear), a \"facón\" (large knife), a \"rebenque\" (leather whip), and loose-fitting trousers called \"bombachas\", belted with a \"tirador\", or a \"chiripá\", a loincloth. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.\n\nTheir tasks were basically to move the cattle between grazing fields, or to market sites such as the port of Buenos Aires. The \"yerra\" consists of branding the animal with the owner’s sign. The taming of animals was another of their usual activities. Taming was a trade especially appreciated throughout Argentina and competitions to domesticate wild foal remained in force at festivals. The majority of Gauchos were illiterate and considered as countrymen.\n\nGauchos also drank a typical drink called mate, traditionally prepared in a hollowed-out gourd and sipped through a mate metal straw called a bombilla. The water for mate was heated (without boiling) on a stove in a kettle. With mate in hand, Gauchos enjoyed the quiet peace of the countryside with only the birds as company. \nGaúcho is also the common denomination of the current inhabitants of the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\n\"Gauchito\" (a boy in the Argentine colors and a gaucho hat) was the mascot for the 1978 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A small amount of grain alcohol (traditionally rectified spirit) is added to the dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough. \"Pączki\" are commonly thought of as fluffy but somewhat collapsed, with a bright stripe around them; these features are seen as evidence that the dough was fried in fresh oil.\n\nAlthough they look like German berliners, North American bismarcks or jelly doughnuts, \"pączki\" are made from especially rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast and sometimes milk. They feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed, or covered with granulated or powdered sugar. \"Powidła\" (stewed plum jam) and wild rose hip jam are traditional fillings, but many others are used as well, including strawberry, Bavarian cream, blueberry, custard, raspberry, and apple.\n\nThe Polish word (plural: ) is a diminutive of the Polish word \"bud\". The latter derives from Proto-Slavic , which may have referred to anything that is round, bulging and about to burst (compare Proto-Slavic \"to swell, burst\"), possibly of ultimately onomatopoeic origin. From Polish the word has been borrowed into several other Slavic languages, where the respective loanwords (, or ) refer to a similar ball-shaped pastry.\n\nEnglish speakers typically use the plural form of the Polish word in both singular and plural. They pronounce it as (the last being closest to the Polish pronunciation) and often write it as \"paczki\", i.e., without the ogonek (hook-shaped diacritic). This should not be confused with the unrelated Polish word , which is the plural form of \"package\".\n\nIn Poland, are eaten especially on Fat Thursday (), the last Thursday prior to Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent. The traditional reason for making \"pączki\" was to use up all the lard, sugar, eggs and fruit in the house, because their consumption was forbidden by Christian fasting practices during the season of Lent.\n\nIn North America, particularly the large Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit, and other large cities across the Midwest and Northeast, Paczki Day is celebrated annually by immigrants and locals alike. The date of this observance merges with that of pre-Lenten traditions of other immigrants (\"e.g.\", Pancake Day, \"Mardi Gras\") on Fat Tuesday. With its sizable Polish population, Chicago celebrates the festival on both Fat Thursday and Fat Tuesday; \"pączki\" are also often eaten on Casimir Pulaski Day. In Buffalo, Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, South Bend, and Windsor, Pączki Day is celebrated on Fat Tuesday.\n\nThe Pączki Day celebrations in some areas are even larger than many celebrations for St. Patrick's Day. In Hamtramck, Michigan, an enclave of Detroit, there is an annual Pączki Day (Shrove Tuesday) Parade, which has gained a devoted following. Throughout the Metro Detroit area, it is so widespread that many bakeries attract lines of customers for \"pączki\" on Pączki Day.\n\nIn some areas, Pączki Day is celebrated with \"pączki\"-eating contests. The contest in Evanston, Illinois, started in 2010, and is held on the weekend before Fat Tuesday, while Hamtramck's contest is held on the holiday.\n\nThese pastries have become popular in the United States as a result of Polish immigrants and marketing by the bakery industry. Sold in bakeries mainly on both Fat Tuesday and Fat Thursday throughout Chicago, they are particularly popular in areas where there is a large concentration of Polish immigrants: Milwaukee Northcentral and Southeastern Wisconsin, Chicago and Northern Illinois, Northwest Indiana, the Greater Detroit and Mid Michigan areas, Toledo, Greater Cincinnati, Greater Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Northern and Central New Jersey, Central Connecticut, Western Massachusetts and greater Chicopee.

Additional items such as ham, green salad, hard boiled eggs and apple can be added. As its name suggests, it is most commonly eaten at lunchtime, is particularly associated with pubs, and often accompanied with beer.\n\nBeer, bread, and cheese have been combined in the English diet since antiquity, and have been served together in inns for centuries. However, the specific term \"ploughman's lunch\" is believed to date from the 1950s, when the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body, began promoting it in pubs as a way to increase the sales of cheese, which had recently ceased to be rationed. Its popularity increased as the Milk Marketing Board promoted the meal nationally throughout the 1960s.\n\nPierce the Ploughman's Crede (c.1394) mentions the traditional ploughman's meal of bread, cheese and beer. Bread and cheese formed the basis of the diet of English rural labourers for centuries, with skimmed-milk cheese, supplemented with a little lard and butter, forming the main source of fats and protein; onions and leeks, in the absence of expensive seasoning, were the \"favoured condiment\". The reliance on cheese rather than meat protein was especially strong in the south of the country. As late as the 1870s, farmworkers in Devon were said to eat \"bread and hard cheese at 2d. a pound, with cider very washy and sour\" for their midday meal. While this diet was associated with rural poverty, it also gained associations with more idealised images of rural life. Anthony Trollope in \"The Duke's Children\" has a character comment that \"A rural labourer who sits on the ditch-side with his bread and cheese and an onion has more enjoyment out of it than any Lucullus\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes the first recorded use of the phrase \"ploughman's luncheon\" as 1837, from the \"Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott\" by John G. Lockhart, but this stray early use may have meant merely the sum of its parts, \"a lunch for a ploughman\".\n\nWhile farm labourers usually carried their food with them to eat in the fields, similar food was for a long time served in public houses as a simple, cheap meal. In 1815 William Cobbett recalled how farmers going to market in Farnham, forty years earlier, would often add \"2d. worth of bread and cheese\" to the pint of beer they drank at the inn stabling their horses. The \"OED\"'s next reference is from the July 1956 \"Monthly Bulletin\" of the Brewers' Society, which describes the activities of the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body affiliated with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. It describes how the Bureau\n\nThis implies that a \"traditional combination\" of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before rationing in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II). Indeed, many pubs served little else: in 1932 Martin Armstrong described stopping at village inns for a lunch of bread, cheese and beer, noting that \"On these occasions in country inns when bread, cheese and beer seem so extraordinarily good, the alternative is generally nothing; and compared with nothing bread, cheese, and beer are beyond compare\".\n\nBy the 1950s the meal was certainly being referred to by forms of the name later used to promote it. In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: \"There's a pub quite close to where I live where ... all you need say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And in a matter of minutes a tray is handed across the counter to you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer\". Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the \"Monthly Bulletin\" of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of \"cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer\". The Glasgow newspaper \"The Bulletin\" from 15 April 1958 and \"The Times\" from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.\n\nThe meal's rise in popularity during the 1970s has been argued to be at least partially based on a British cultural \"revulsion from technology and modernity and a renewed love-affair with an idealised national past\". The meal was, however, primarily favoured by caterers because it was simple to prepare, required no cooking, was not labour-intensive and involved no meat, meaning there was the potential of high profit margins.\n\nThe 1983 film \"The Ploughman's Lunch\", from a screenplay by Ian McEwan, has a subtext that is \"the way countries and people re-write their own history to suit the needs of the present\". The title is a reference to the way the supposed traditional meal was apparently used as a way to get people to eat meals in pubs.\n\n"}

Lemon rind is also commonly used as a garnish, with the citrus oils subtly complementing the flavour.\n\nPink gin is widely thought to have been created by members of the Royal Navy. Plymouth gin is a 'sweet' gin, as opposed to London gin which is 'dry', and was added to Angostura bitters to make the consumption of Angostura bitters more enjoyable as they were used as a treatment for sea sickness in 1824 by Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert.\n\nThe British Royal Navy then brought the idea for the drink to bars in England, where this method of serving was first noted on the mainland. By the 1870s, gin was becoming increasingly popular and many of the finer establishments in England were serving pink gins.\n\nA typical pink gin is one part gin and one dash of angostura bitters.\n\nThough there are no major variations of pink gin, many bartenders vary the amount of angostura bitters used. Typically the drink is topped up with iced water, rarely without water.\n\nA bartender may ask customers whether they want it \"in or out\", upon which the bartender swirls the angostura bitters around the glass before either leaving it in, or pouring it out (leaving only a residue), and then adding the gin.\n\nIt is also common for pink gin to be served as 'pink gin and tonic', typically consisting of 4 dashes of angostura bitters and 2 shots of gin, which is then topped up with tonic water. This is served in a highball glass over ice, and then can be garnished with lemon.\n\nCedric Charles Dickens (great-grandson of Charles Dickens) records in \"Drinking With Dickens\" that a 'Burnt Pink Gin' consists of 1 tsp Angostura burnt by heating over a flame and then poured into \"a large tot dry gin\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lemon meringue pie is prepared with a bottom pie crust, with the meringue directly on top of the lemon filling. No upper crust is used, as in a cherry pie.\n\nLemon flavoured custards, puddings and pies have been made since Medieval times, but meringue was perfected in the 17th century. Lemon meringue pie, as it is known today, is a 19th-century product. The earliest recorded recipe was attributed to Alexander Frehse, a Swiss baker from Romandy. There is some evidence to suggest that the botanist Emile Campbell-Browne (1830-1925) had a very similar recipe concocted by his cooking staff in Wigbeth, Dorset, in 1875 and served to Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury at a hunting ball, in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset.\n\nThe lemon custard is usually prepared with egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and, optionally, starch. This gives it a texture similar to that of a sturdy pudding. The meringue, which includes well beaten egg whites and sugar, is cooked on top of the pie filling. As the meringue bakes, air bubbles trapped inside the protein of the egg white will expand and swell. However, if the egg whites are beaten too much, or if a tiny amount of fat is allowed to contaminate the mixture, then the proteins will not be able to form the correct molecular structure when cooked, and the meringue may collapse when cooked. The meringue can be beaten into either soft or stiff peaks. The temperature the pie is baked at and the method by which sugar is added also determines the texture and durability of the meringue. \n\n\n\n"}

Many variants are popular throughout Asia, and around the world.\n\nIn most English-speaking countries, a \"kebab\" is commonly the internationally-known \"shish kebab\" or \"shashlik\", though outside of North America a \"kebab\" may be the ubiquitous fast-food \"doner kebab\" or its variants. In contrast, in Indian English and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a \"kebab\" is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese \"chuanr\".\n\nAlthough kebabs are often cooked on a skewer, many types of kebab are not. Kebab dishes can consist of cut up or ground meat or seafood, sometimes with fruits and vegetables; cooked on a skewer over a fire, or like a hamburger on a grill, baked in a pan in an oven, or as a stew; and served with various accompaniments according to each recipe. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often mutton or lamb, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or more rarely due to religious prohibitions, pork.\n\nEvidence of hominin use of fire and cooking in the Middle East dates back as far as 790,000 years, and prehistoric hearths, earth ovens, and burnt animal bones were spread across Europe and the Middle East by at least 250,000 years ago. Excavations of the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri unearthed stone supports for skewers used before the 17th century BC. In ancient times, Homer in the Iliad (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (), and the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian text, also mentions large pieces of meat roasted on spits.\n\nIn Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook \"Kitab al-Tabikh\", a compendium of much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisine, there are descriptions of \"kabāb\" as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire. The method of cooking smaller chunks or slices of meat on skewers has a long history in the region, where it would be practical in cities where small cuts of meat were available in butchers' shops, and where fuel for cooking was relatively scarce, compared to Europe, where extensive forests enabled farmers to roast large cuts of meat whole. Indeed, many cultures have dishes consisting of chunks of meat cooked over a fire on skewers, such as the anticucho that has been prepared in South America since long before contact with Europe and Asia.\n\nHowever, while the word \"kebab\" or \"shish kebab\" may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer, \"kebab\" is mainly associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in the medieval kitchens of Persia and Turkey. Though the word has ancient origins, it was popularized by Turks to refer to this range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on skewers, but also as stews, meatballs, and other forms. This cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim influence. According to Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller, kebab was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan. Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe word \"\" likely came to English in the late 17th century from the Arabic \"kabāb\", partly through Urdu, Persian and Turkish. According to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word \"kebap\" is also derived from the Arabic word \"kabāb\", meaning roasted meat. It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in \"Kyssa-i Yusuf\" (the story of Joseph), though still in the Arabic form. Nişanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of \"frying/burning\" with \"kabābu\" in the old Akkadian language, and \"kbabā/כבבא\" in Aramaic. In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian \"kabab\", which probably derived from the Aramaic.\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of \"burn\", \"char\", or \"roast\", from the Aramaic and Akkadian. The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not be \"kabbaba\" (burned). These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: \"*kab-\", to burn or roast.\n\n\"Suya\" is a spicy kebab which is a popular food item in West Africa. It is traditionally prepared by the Hausa people of northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Ghana and some parts of Sudan (where it is called \"agashe\").\n\n\"Kyinkyinga\" is common and popular in West Africa. It is a Ghanian dish, very similar to or synonymous with the Hausa \"suya\" kebab, also known as \"sooya, tsinga, chichinga, tsire agashi, chachanga\" or \"tankora\".\n\n\"Sosatie\" (pl \"sosaties\") is a traditional South African dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term derives from \"sate\" (\"skewered meat\") and \"saus\" (spicy sauce). It is of Cape Malay origin. Sosatie recipes vary, but commonly the ingredients can include cubes of lamb, beef, chicken, dried apricots, red onions and mixed peppers.\n\nAfghan kebab (Pashto/Dari: کباب) is most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant. Afghan kebab is served with naan, rarely rice, and customers have the option to sprinkle sumac or \"ghora\", dried ground sour grapes, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor.\n\nOther popular kebabs include the lamb chop, ribs, beef, buffalo, and chicken, all of which are found in better restaurants.\n\nChapli kebab, a specialty of Eastern Afghanistan, is a patty made from beef mince. It is a popular barbecue meal in Afghanistan. The word Chapli comes from the Pashto word Chaprikh, which means flat. It is prepared flat and round, and served with naan. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste and less expensive.\n\n\"Khorovats\" () is a dish of pieces of meat grilled on flat skewers known as \"shish\" or \"shampoor\". It is very popular, especially on festive occasions. In contrast to shish kebab, the meat pieces are typically larger, and left on the bone. While sometimes coated in salt, pepper, onions, and herbs shortly before cooking, vinegar-based marinades are not used. Various kinds of meat are used, the most common is pork, with ribs being the most popular cut. Vegetables are not cooked on the same skewer.\n\nSeasoned oblong meatballs cooked on skewers, known in other regions as \"lule kebab\" or \"kufte\", are called \"kyabab\", with the emphasis on the first syllable. \"Karsi khorovats\" is the Armenian name for doner kebab, which the city of Kars became known for during the time of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the Republic of Azerbaijan, the main varieties include tika kebab, lyulya kebab (doyma kebab in some places), tas kebaby and tava kebab. The meat for tika kebab is sometimes prepared in basdirma (an onion gravy and thyme) and then goes onto the skewers. It may be served, wrapped in lavash, with sauce-like pomegranate addon (narsharab) and other condiments.\n\nIn Bangladesh there are various types of kebabs (Bengali কাবাব or \"Kabab\"). In the old Mughal province of Bengal Subah's capital of Dhaka, various Perso- and Arab-influenced dishes started to be made. Amongst these were kebabs. In Bangladesh most kebabs are made using beef whereas its Indian Bengali neighbours use chicken or mutton to make it. Amongst the popular kebabs are:\nIn Bulgaria, the word \"кебап\" (kebap) is a generic term for meat stews with few or no vegetables. The döner kebab is widespread as fast food and is called (dyuner). Shish kebap / shashlik is also common, and is called (shishche - \"small skewer\").\n\nChuanr (), often referred to as \"chua'r\" throughout the north, or kawap (كاۋاپ) in Uyghur, is a variation of kebab originating from the Uyghur people in the western province of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine. The dish has since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street food.\n\nAlthough the most traditional form of chuanr uses lamb or mutton, other types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as well. Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or deep-fried. Common spices and condiments include cumin called \"ziran\", pepper, sesame, and sesame oil.\n\nWhile the history of street foods in Greece goes back to ancient times, the iconic Greek \"gyros\" and \"souvlaki\" as it is known today arose only following the Second World War. Introduced to Athens in the 1950s by immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East, gyros was originally known simply as \"döner kebab\". It is typically served as a sandwich rolled in pita bread, or on a plate, with french fries and various salads and sauces such as tzatziki. Later in the 1960s, vendors also began selling dishes in the same style made with souvlaki, which resembles Turkish shish kebab, but is usually made with pork.\n\nAround the same time, the Greek word \"gyros\" replaced \"döner kebab\", and the Greek style of the dish spread to become popular, particularly in North America, and various other parts of the world.\n\nIn contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, both types of sandwich may be called \"souvlaki\", with the skewered meat being called \"kalamaki\".\n\nAlthough gyros is unquestionably of Middle Eastern origin, the issue of whether modern-day souvlaki came to Greece via Turkish cuisine, and should be considered a Greek styling of shish kebab, or is a contemporary revival of Greek tradition dating as far back as 17th century BC Minoan civilization, is a topic of sometimes heated debate, at least between Greeks and Turks. While English speakers may refer to souvlaki skewers as kebabs, they are not properly called that in Greece.\n\nThough spit- or skewer-cooked meat dishes are noted in an ancient Indian text, the \"Mahabaratha\", and a Medieval Indian text, the \"Manasollasa\", modern-day kebabs in India mostly trace their origin to the influence of Mughlai cuisine. Some varieties of kebab in India are more or less similar to kebab preparations elsewhere but with a distinctive taste, which can be credited to the use of Indian spices. Other varieties are entirely distinct versions native to India. such as \"Tunde ke kabab\", \"Tikka kebab\", \"Shami kebab\", \"Soovar ki Saanth\" (pork belly kebabs from Rajasthan) and \"Rajpooti soolah\". The prevalence of vegetarianism in much of India also means that there are many local vegetarian varieties made from Paneer or potato.\n\nVarieties such as sheesh, doner (known as shawarma), shammi, tikka, and other forms of roasted and grilled meats are found in India. Some popular kebabs are:\nKebab in Indonesia are the same as other kebab. Indonesian kebab are served as dinner.\n\nThere are several distinct Persian varieties of kebab (). Kebab may be served with either steamed, saffroned basmati or Persian rice and called \"chelow kabab\" (), which is considered the national dish of Iran. It may also be served with the various types of bread that are the most commonly eaten in Iran, such as lavash.\n\nIt is served with the basic Iranian meal accompaniments, in addition to grilled tomatoes on the side of the rice and butter on top of the rice. It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in Tehran) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. \"Somagh\", powdered sumac, is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.\n\nAt Persian restaurants, the combination of one kabab barg and one kabab koobideh is typically called \"Soltani\", meaning \"sultan's feast\". The traditional beverage of choice to accompany kebab is doogh, a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt.\n\nIn the old bazaar tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kebabs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kebabs, barg and koobideh, two skewers are always served. In general, bazaar kebab restaurants only serve these two varieties, though there are exceptions.\n\nIn Iranian Azerbaijan, \"Binab (also Bonab) Kebabi\" is very famous in Azerbaijani cuisine for its large size. It is named after the city of Binab in East Azerbaijan province. This kebab and other types (e.g., Shishlik, kubide, Berge, Gelin, etc.) can be served alone or with rice and fresh salad on the side. In this region Kebabs come usually with yogurt, hot bread, tomato, onion, parsley and paprika-salt, and tarragon.\nKabab koobideh () it kūbide () is an Iranian minced meat kabab which is made from ground lamb, beef, or chicken, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions.\n\nKabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric, and seasoning. These ingredients are mixed together until the mixture becomes smooth and sticky. One egg is added to help the mix stick together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab is typically long.\n\nKabāb-e barg () is a Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef kebab dish. The main ingredients of \"Kabab Barg\" – a short form of this name – are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank or chicken breast, onions and olive oil.\n\nMarinade is prepared by the mixture of half a cup of olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4–5 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5–10 minutes on each side. Kabab-e Barg\n\nJūje-kabāb () consists of pieces of chicken first marinated in minced onion and lemon juice with saffron then grilled over a fire. It is sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper. Jujeh kabab is one of the most popular Persian dishes.\n\nKabab Bakhtiari is a combination of Jujeh kabab (chicken kabab) and Kabab barg (beef or lamb meat) on the same skewer. Its name comes from the Bakhtiari region of Iran.\n\nKabab Kenjeh, also known as Chenjeh () is a kabab traditionally made with chunks of marinated lamb meat. It is typically served with grilled tomatoes and rice or bread.\n\nSeveral types of kebab are popular in Iraq, although the word kebab in local use is reserved for skewers of spiced ground lamb, traditionally grilled on natural wood charcoal to give the kebab its special flavor. Skewers of grilled marinated meat chunks are called tikka, the most popular of which is the chicken tikka.\n\nKebabs in Iraq are consumed any time of the day, including for breakfast.\n\nMizrahi Jews brought various types of grilled meat from their native Middle Eastern countries to Israel, where they are an essential part of the cuisine. Among the most popular are skewers of elongated spiced ground meat, called kabab (, \"qabab\"), which have become a staple dish of meat restaurants and the main dish of the traditional holiday barbecues, alongside the shishlik. They are commonly made of beef, though lamb is also occasionally used, and are almost always served with the local pita bread.\n\nSeveral varieties of kebabs can be found at most restaurants representing this region. Among the most common are shish taouk, which are grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and spices, and \"lahem meshwi\", charcoal-grilled skewers of prime lamb cubes lightly seasoned with herbs.\n\nShawarma, although not considered a kebab in most countries of the Levant and Egypt, is another very popular type of grilled meat preparation that characterizes this region.\n\nIn Nepal it is a popular dish in Nepalese cuisine as well as Newa cuisine and known as Sekuwa. It is a meat roasted in a natural wood/log fire in a real traditional Nepalese country style. At first while the meat is still in its raw stage is mixed with homemade natural herbs and spices and other necessary ingredients. Sekuwa could be of pork, lamb, goat or chicken, or a mixture. Sekuwa is very popular in Nepal, especially in the Eastern Nepal and Kathmandu. Tarahara, a small town in Sunsari District of Koshi State in the Eastern Nepal could be called as the sekuwa capital of Nepal.\n\nKebabs in Pakistan trace their origin to the influence of the Mughlai cuisine.\n\nPakistani cuisine has different kebabs. Meat including beef/buff, chicken, lamb and fish is used in kebabs. Some popular kebabs are:\n\n\n\"Satay\" is a kebab of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, served with a sauce. It is a dish of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n\nSatay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, lamb, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu. Traditionally skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond are used, although bamboo skewers are often used instead. It is grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire with spicy seasonings. It may be served with various sauces, though most often a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.\n\nSatay was developed by Javanese street vendors as a unique adaptation of Indian kebab. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as \"tongseng\" and \"gulai kambing\" based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century. It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.\n\nBeyti kebab is a style of kebab named for Beyti Güler that originated in his eponymous kebab shop Beyti. It is a minced lamb kebab with garlicky yogurt and pepper wrapped in lavash or yufka breads.\nShish kebab is a dish consisting of small cubes of meat or fish threaded on a skewer and grilled. \"Şiş\", pronounced , is a Turkish word meaning \"sword\" or \"skewer\". Tradition has it that the dish was invented by medieval soldiers who used their swords to grill meat over open-field fires.\n\nIn Turkey, shish kebab does not normally contain vegetables, though they may be cooked on a separate skewer. It can be prepared with lamb, beef, chicken, or fish, but pork is not used.\nCağ kebabı is similar to doner kebab, but cooked on a horizontal spit rather than vertical. It is associated with the Eastern Turkish province of Erzurum.\nDöner kebab, literally \"rotating kebab\" in Turkish, is sliced lamb, beef, or chicken, slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit. The Middle Eastern shawarma, Mexican tacos al pastor, and Greek gyros are all derived from the Turkish döner kebab, which was invented in Bursa in the 19th century.\n\nThe German-style döner kebab sandwich, sometimes called simply \"a kebab\" in English, was introduced by Turkish immigrants in Berlin in the 1970s, and has become one of the most popular take-away foods in Germany and much of Europe. It is commonly sold by Turks, and considered a Turkish-German specialty, in Germany.\nİskender kebap is a dish made with doner kebab meat, served with tomato sauce, melted butter, and yogurt, on pita bread. It is named after a cook from Bursa who is often credited with the invention of the doner kebab.\n\nAdana kebabı (or kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled over charcoal. It is generally \"hot\" or piquant. The traditional Adana Kebab is made using lamb, with a high fatty content cooked over hot coals. Only three ingredients are used in a proper Adana Kebab, minced lamb, red capsicum (pepper) and salt.\n\nSteam kebab (Turkish: Buğu kebabı) is a Turkish stew which is cooked in a pan or an earthenware casserole. The casserole's lid is sealed in order to cook the meat in its own juices. The dish is prepared with pearl onions, garlic, thyme, and other spices. In Tekirdağ, it is served with cumin; in Izmir, it is served with mastic.\n\nTesti kebab is a dish from Central Anatolia and the Mid-Western Black Sea region, consisting of a mixture of meat and vegetables cooked in a clay pot or jug over fire (\"testi\" means \"jug\" in Turkish). The pot is sealed with bread dough or foil and is broken when serving.\n\nBurrah kebab is another kebab from India. This is usually made of goat or lamb meat, liberally marinated with spices and charcoal grilled. It uses cuts of chops and not other meat cuts\n\n\"Ćevapi\" () or \"ćevapčići\" (formal diminutive, , ), which comes from the word \"kebab\", is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of skinless sausage, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania. Ćevapi has its origins in the Balkans during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the kofte kebab. A dish with similar origins is in Romania called mititei.\n\nChapli kebab is a patty made from beef mince, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, salt, black pepper, lemon juice or promegranate seeds, eggs, cornstarch and coriander leaves. Chapli kebab is a common dish in Pashtun cuisine and popular in Afghanistan, Pakistan. The kebab originates in Afghanistan. Mardan is famous for chapli kabab not only locally but also internationally.\n\nChapli kebab is prepared flat and round and generally served with naan.\n\nThe word \"Chapli\" comes from the Pashto word \"Chaprikh\", which means \"flat\".\n\nThe Galouti kebab is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, made of minced goat and green papaya. It was supposedly made for a Nawab in Lucknow who could not eat the regular Kebabs due to weak teeth. Like Lucknowi biryani and Kakori kebab, it is a hallmark of Awadhi cuisine.\n\nMany leading Indian hotel chains have taken to popularising the Awadhi food tradition, with the Galouti kebab being a \"pièce de résistance\". The home of this kebab is Lucknow. It is most famously had at the almost iconic eatery \"Tundey Miyan\" at Old Lucknow.\n\nKakori kebab is an Indian kebab attributed to the city of Kakori in Uttar Pradesh, India. The kebab is made of finely ground mince goat meat with spices and then charcoal grilled on a skewer. It is commonly served with Roomali Roti (a very thin bread), onion and a mint chutney (sauce). The meat is ground to a fine paste and kept moist so the texture is soft. There is a legend that it was first prepared for old and toothless pilgrims.\n\nKalmi kebab a popular snack in Indian cuisine. The dish is made by marinating chicken drumsticks and placing them in a tandoor. Various kinds of freshly ground Indian spices are added to the yogurt used for the marination of the chicken. When prepared, the drumsticks are usually garnished with mint leaves and served with onions and Indian bread.\n\nA kind of kebab served with a spicy tomato sauce and Aleppo pepper, very common in Syria and Lebanon, named after the city of Aleppo (\"Halab\"). Kebab Halabi has around 26 variants including:\n\n\"Pinchitos\" or \"Pinchos Morunos\" is a Moorish-derived kebab dish in Spanish cuisine. The name \"pinchitos\" is used in the southern Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer () which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years.\n\n\"Shashlik\" is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab. It is popular in many countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Baltics. In non-Muslim-majority countries, shashlik and equivalent dishes like Romanian \"frigărui\" may sometimes be prepared with pork.\n\nKebab cuisine has spread around the world together with Muslim influence. Although non-Muslim Westerners may be increasingly familiar with some of the many other international kebab dishes, only two have become an established and widely popular part of the culture in many Western countries. In English, the word \"kebab\" commonly refers to \"shish kebab\" and, outside of North America, to \"döner kebab\" or related fast-food dishes. These dishes are also served in many other countries, where they may have different names.\n\nIn English, \"kebab\", or in North America also \"kabob\", often occurring as \"shish kebab\", is now a culinary term for small pieces of meat cooked on a skewer. The word \"kebab\", most likely derived from Arabic, has been used with various spellings in this sense since at least the 17th century, while the Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known publication of the term \"shish kebab\", derived from , in 1914.\n\nIn many English-speaking countries, it refers to the now well-known dish prepared with marinated meat or seafood together with vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers threaded onto the skewer, also sometimes known as \"shashlik\". This preparation is different from the typical Turkish shish kebab style, where vegetables are usually cooked on a separate skewer. Shish kebabs are customarily prepared in homes and restaurants, and are usually cooked on a grill or barbecue, or roasted in an oven.\n\nThe word \"kebab\" may also be used as a general term in English to describe any similar-looking skewered food, such as brochette, satay, souvlaki, yakitori, or numerous small chunks of any type of food served on a stick. This is different from its use in the Middle East, where \"shish\" (Persian/Mazandarani: شیش, ) is the word for skewer, while \"kebab\" comes from the word for grilling.\n\nEnglish speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word \"kebab\" generally to mean the popular fast food version of the Turkish döner kebab, or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from kebab shops as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.\n\nThe döner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with pita or other flatbreads. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a \"Döner\", though Arab shops there serve \"shawarma\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "390774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390774", "title": "Pound cake", "text": "Pound cake\n\nPound cake refers to a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. Pound cakes are generally baked in either a loaf pan or a Bundt mold, and served either dusted with powdered sugar, lightly glazed, or sometimes with a coat of icing.\n\nIt is believed that the pound cake is of northern European origin that dates back to the early 1700s. A recipe for pound cake is in the first American cookbook, \"American Cookery\", which was published in 1796.\n\nOver time the ingredients for pound cake changed. Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of Direction for Cookery, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges. This changed the flavor and texture of the cake. In the 2008 issue of \"Saveur\", James Villas wrote that cake flour would not work in place of all-purpose flour because it lacks the strength to support the heavy batter.\n\nAn early variation on this cake replaced some of the flour with cornmeal made from dried corn (maize), which was then called \"Indian meal\". A recipe for Indian pound cake was first published in 1828 by Eliza Leslie and later included in \"The Indian Meal Book\", which was published in London in 1846, when people in Ireland were looking for alternatives to expensive wheat flour.\n\nThere are numerous variations on the traditional pound cake, with certain countries and regions having distinctive styles. These can include the addition of flavouring agents (such as vanilla extract or almond extract) or dried fruit (such as currants or dried cranberries), as well as alterations to the original recipe to change the characteristics of the resulting pound cake. For instance, baking soda or baking powder may be incorporated to induce leavening during baking, resulting in a less dense pound cake. A cooking oil (typically a vegetable oil) is sometimes substituted for some or all of the butter, which is intended to produce a moister cake. Sour cream pound cake is a popular variation in the United States, which involves the substitution of sour cream for some of the butter, which also is intended to produce a moister cake with a tangy flavor. Some of these variations may drastically change the texture and flavor of the pound cake, but the name pound cake is often still used. Some of the variations are described below.\n\nA traditional American pound cake would contain one pound each of flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. This recipe is quite popular in the cuisine of the Southern United States.\n\nIn France, the pound cake is well known. The name of the pound cake \"\"quatre-quarts\"\", means four quarters. There are equal weights in each of the four quarters. In tradition, the popular cake of the French region of Brittany, as its name implies, uses the same quantity of the four ingredients, but with no added fruit of any kind. However, the Caribbean parts of the world that speak French traditionally add rum to the ingredients for Christmas Eve or even mashed bananas for extra moisture. In some cases the French might have beaten egg whites instead of whole eggs to lighten the batter. Other variants include adding chocolate or lemon juice for flavour.\n\nIn Mexico, the pound cake is called \"panqué\". The basic recipe of Mexican \"panqué\" is much like the traditional U.S. recipe. Most common variants are \"panqué con nueces\" (pound cake with walnuts) and \"panqué con pasas\" (pound cake with raisins).\n\n\"Ponqué\" is the Venezuelan and Colombian version of the pound cake: the term \"ponqué\" is itself a Spanish phonetic approximation of \"pound-cake\". The \"ponqué\" is essentially a wine-drenched cake with a cream or sugar coating, and it is very popular at birthdays, weddings and other social celebrations.\n\nThe German \"Eischwerteig mit Fett\" (roughly \"egg-weight dough with fat\") is a recipe very similar to the pound cake, but thought of in multiples of the weight of the average egg used. For example, in a German cooks vocational school book from the 1980's the basic recipe for such a cake baked in a 26 cm spring form tin is given as four eggs, 3 egg-weights of butter, 4 egg-weights of sugar, three egg weights of flour and one egg-weight of starch. If you add it all up, it is close to the English pound of each and the French four equal quarters. \n\nThinking of the dough in terms of base egg-weight makes it a very versatile base recipe which can be easily scaled to different sized tins by increasing or decreasing the number of eggs and the dependent ingredient weights. And so, with the simple addition of nuts, chocolate, dried fruits and alcohols, and the use of different shapes and sizes of tins, a wide variety of traditional German cakes are made. For example, this dough or a minor variation of it is often used to make cakes made in a loaf tin (\"Orangenkuchen\" - orange cake; \"Nußkuchen\"- hazelnut cake), marbled cakes in a bundt tin (\"Marmorkuchen\" ) and other flavor combinations in shaped tins \"(Falscher\" \"Rehrücken\" - fake venison saddle with bitter chocolate and almonds , \"Osterlamm\" - Easter Lamb with vanilla and rum).\n\n"}
{"id": "390827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390827", "title": "Wedding cake", "text": "Wedding cake\n\nA wedding cake is the traditional cake served at wedding receptions following dinner. In some parts of England, the wedding cake is served at a wedding breakfast; the 'wedding breakfast' does not mean the meal will be held in the morning, but at a time following the ceremony on the same day. In modern Western culture, the cake is usually on display and served to guests at the reception. Traditionally, wedding cakes were made to bring good luck to all guests and the couple. Modernly however, they are more of a centerpiece to the wedding and are not always even served to the guests. Some cakes are built with only a single edible tier for the bride and groom to share, but this is rare since the cost difference between fake and real tiers is minimal.\n\nWedding cakes come in a variety of sizes, depending on the number of guests the cake will serve. Modern pastry chefs and cake designers use various ingredients and tools to create a cake that usually reflects the personalities of the couple. Marzipan, fondant, gum paste, buttercream, and chocolate are among the popular ingredients used. Cakes range in price along with size and components. Cakes are usually priced on a per-person, or per-slice, basis. Prices can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per-person or slice, depending on the pastry chef who is hired to make the cake. Wedding cakes and cake decorating in general have become a certain pop culture symbol in western society. In the United States, reality television shows such as \"Cake Boss\" and \"Amazing Wedding Cakes\" have become popular and are trending in today’s popular culture.\n\nThe contemporary wedding cake has grown out of several different ethnic traditions. One of the first traditions began in Ancient Rome, where a cake of wheat or barley was broken over the bride’s head to bring good fortune to the couple.\n\nDuring the 16th century to the 17th century, the “bride's pie” was served at most weddings. Different from the modern sweet wedding cake, bride pie is savoury. Bride pie is a pie with pastry crust and filled an assortment of oysters, lamb testicles, pine kernels, cocks' combs from Robert May's 1685 recipe. For May's recipe, there is a compartment of bride pie which filled with live birds or a snake for the guests to pass way the time in a wedding when they cut up the pie at the table. Guests were expected to have a piece out of politeness. It was considered very rude and bad luck not to eat the bride’s pie. One tradition of bride’s pie was to place a glass ring in the middle of the dessert and the maiden who found it would be the next to marry, similar to the modern tradition of catching the Flower bouquet. \n\nIn the 17th century, two cakes were made, one for the bride and one for the groom. The groom's cake would die out and the bride's cake become the main cake for the event. When the two cakes were served together, the groom's cake was typically the darker colored, rich fruit cake and generally much smaller than the bride's cake. The bride’s cake was usually a simple pound cake with white icing because white was a sign of virginity and purity. \n\nWedding cake was originally a luxury item, and a sign of celebration and social status. The bigger the cake, the higher the social standing. Wedding cakes in England and early America were traditionally fruit cakes, often topped with marzipan and icing with tiers, Cutting the cake was an important part of the reception. White icing was also a symbol of money and social importance in Victorian times, so a white cake was highly desired. Today, many flavors and configurations are available in addition to the traditional all-white tiered cake.\n\nIn Medieval England cakes were stacked as high as possible for the bride and groom to kiss over. A successful kiss meant they were guaranteed a prosperous life together. From this the Croquembouche was created. The myth behind this cake tells of a Pastry chef, visiting Medieval England who witnessed their tradition of piling sweet rolls between the bride and groom, which they attempted to kiss over without knocking them all down. The pastry chef then went back to France and piled sweet rolls up into a tower to make the first Croquembouche. The modern croquembouche is still very popular in France, where it is now common to place the croquembouche tower on a bed of cake and make it a top tier. This traditional French wedding cake is built from Profiteroles and given a halo of spun sugar.\n\nIn 1703, Thomas Rich, a baker's apprentice from Ludgate Hill, fell in love with his employer's daughter and asked her to marry him. He wanted to make an extravagant cake, so he drew on St Bride's Church, on Fleet Street in London for inspiration.\n\nTraditionally the bride would place a ring inside the couple's portion of the cake to symbolise acceptance of the proposal. Bride’s pie would evolve into the bride’s cake. At this point the dessert was no longer in the form of a pie and was sweeter than its predecessor. The bride cake was traditionally a plum or fruit cake. In mid 18th century, double icing, which means covering the cake first with almond icing and then with the kind of white icing, was used in bride cake. White-iced upper surface of the bride cake was used as a platform on which all sorts of scenes and emblems could be mounted. The decoration was appeared, they were often at least partially three-dimensional, were colourful. However, since some decoration were made in a variety of substances, sometimes the decoration or even parts of wedding cake were inedible. In The myth that eating the pie would bring good luck was still common but the glass ring slowly died out and the flower bouquet toss replaced it.\n\nFruit cakes were a sign of fertility and prosperity, which helped them gain popularity because married men wanted to have plenty of children. The bride’s cake would transform into the modern wedding cake we know today. In the early 19th century, sugar became easier to obtain during the time when the bride’s cakes became popular. The more refined and whiter sugars were still very expensive. so only wealthy families could afford to have a very pure white frosting. This display would show the wealth and social status of the family. When Queen Victoria used white icing on her cake it gained a new title, royal icing.\n\nThe modern wedding cake as we know it now would originate at the 1882 wedding of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany; his wedding cake was the first to actually be completely edible. Pillars between cake tiers did not begin to appear until about 20 years later. The pillars were very poorly made from broomsticks covered in icing. The tiers represented prosperity and were a status symbol because only wealthy families could afford to include them in the cake. Prince Leopold’s wedding cake was created in separate layers with very dense icing. When the icing would harden the tiers could be stacked, a groundbreaking innovation for wedding cakes at the time. Modern wedding cakes still use this method, with an added form of support with dowels imbedded in the cake to help carry the load especially of larger cakes.\n\nWedding cakes have been present at wedding ceremonies for centuries. They were not always the focus of the event and often came in different forms, like pies or bread. There has always been a lot of symbolism associated with the wedding cake. The earliest known sweet wedding cake is known as a Banbury cake, which became popular in 1655. The white color has been attached to wedding ceremonies since the Victorian era when Queen Victoria chose to wear a white wedding dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. Queen Victoria accentuated an existing symbol, the color white is frequently associated with virginity and purity. The wedding cake was originally known as the brides cake therefore the color white became common because the cake needed to reflect the bride.\n\nThe cutting of the cake is a task full of symbolism. The cake was originally intended to be distributed among the guests by only the bride because consuming the cake would ensure fertility. As weddings grew and the number of guests increased this task became a joint venture, the groom needed to help cut the growing cake and distribute it among their guests. Layers of cakes began to pile up and the icing would need to support the weight of the cake making is very difficult for one person to cut. The groom would assist the bride in this process. Once this tradition began the bride and groom would share a piece of cake before distributing it to the guests to symbolize their union and their promise to forever provide for each other.\n\nThe wedding cake is surrounded by superstitions. In a traditional American wedding, maidens would be invited to pull ribbons that are attached to the bottom layer of the wedding cake. Out of all the ribbons, only one contains a charm or a ring, and whoever gets the charm will be the next person to marry. In other countries, the wedding cake is broken over the bride’s head to ensure fertility and bring good fortune to the couple. Also, some people today think that eating the crumbs of the wedding cake would give them good luck because the wedding cake symbolizes happiness and good life to the newlywed couple.\n\nThere are also myths that most bridesmaids have on dreaming their future husbands. Hopeful bridesmaids would take a piece of cake home and place it under the pillow. Some bridesmaids would sleep with the pieces of cake in their left stocking and the rest are under their pillows after passing the pieces of cake through the bride's wedding ring.\n\nIn the medieval era, wedding cakes were constructed in rolls and buns that were laid on top of each other. The groom and bride would attempt to share a passionate kiss on top of the stack of rolls to ensure fertility and have good fortune. In the 18th century, newlywed couples would try to keep the cake until their first anniversary to prevent them from marriage problems in the future. This is one of the reasons why cakes in the 18th century were made of fruits and blended with wine.\n\nWedding cakes come in several types, such as traditional wedding cakes, wedding cakes based on flavor, smaller cakes or individual cakes, frosted cakes, and cupcakes. Traditional wedding cakes are white, including decoration and icing varieties such as buttercream, almond. etc. Wedding cakes based on flavor include chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. Smaller cakes or individual cakes can be more efficient in terms of price. Frosted cakes are popular due to the large amount of cream.\n\nIn modern society, the most popular wedding cake is called \"traditional stack cake\". This consists of layers of tiers - which can be a different flavors – positioned directly on top of the last\". The traditional stack wedding cake is similar to the tiered cake. Often they are filled with flowers or columns to add visual impact and height. Separators can include jewels, shells, flowers and the like or can be completely separated by using traditional chrome stands.\n\nWhite cake is currently the most traditional wedding cake flavor, but different flavors of filling can be added between layers. Chocolate, carrot, Italian Rum and Italian Cream are also popular choices. Frosting can be a classic smooth surface or combined with drizzle, swirls, or chips.\n\nFondant is a form of frosting style that is rolled out and draped over tiers. Its smooth, firm sugar icing is often embellished with appliqués, Fondant can be cut into designs, formed into shapes, flavored or tinted. Poured fondant is used to glaze petits fours and other detailed confections.\n\nFlowerpaste or Gumpaste is a pliable dough made from egg whites, unflavored gelatine, powdered sugar, Carboximetil Cellulose(CMC) TYLOSE, or GUM tragacamthum. There are an array of methods and ingredients around the world on how to make flowerpaste/gumpaste. The purpose of this dough is to create flowers and decorations for a cake. Due to the use of gum as one of the ingredients; it can be rolled very thin.\n\nRoyal icing is made with sugar and egg white or meringue powder. It hardens to a firm finish that can be piped or thinned for \"flood work\". It hardens fast and is ideal for making detailed shapes ahead of time. It can also be piped directly onto cake tiers and works beautifully for delicate work. a few things to consider when working with royal icing: You must use grease free utensils. Humidity also affects the consistency of royal icing. a well known British cake decorator uses royal icing as a medium, Joseph Lambeth developed a style by creating layered scrolls with Royal Icing.\n\nIn some areas, particularly South America, two cakes are presented at weddings. The more traditional tiered cake is the bride's cake, and a second flavor choice is called the \"groom's cake\". This tradition was brought over from England by early American colonists, who considered the white-iced \"Bride's Cake\" too light for masculinity. The groom's cake was usually a dark, liquor-soaked fruitcake, particularly in Virginia. Today groom's cakes are usually chocolate, although the groom often choose another of his favorite flavors. The groom's cake is usually decorated or shaped as something significant to him, such as a hobby item, sports team or symbol of his occupation. The movie \"Steel Magnolias\" features a red velvet groom's cake in the shape of a giant armadillo. The groom's cake is served at the reception as a second flavor choice for the guests, although in some regions it is served at the rehearsal dinner.\n\nWedding cake toppers are models or art pieces that sit atop the cake. The most common type of cake topper features a representation of a bride and groom in wedding attire. This custom was dominant in US weddings in the 1950s, where it represented togetherness. Wedding toppers today are often figures that indicate shared hobbies or other passions, if they are used at all. Some are humorous, or may represent the couple's hobby or occupation. Some couples use a piece of art which will be displayed in their home later, such as a statuette or Christmas ornament. Some couples skip the topper altogether or decorate the top tier with flowers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the traditional wedding cake is made from a rich fruitcake whose ingredients last without degrading. This allowed the top tier to be stored after the wedding, to be eaten at the christening of the first child. Many modern cakes now consist of flavors such as vanilla sponge, chocolate sponge or carrot cake.\n\nMost cakes are between three and five tiers in height. Royal wedding cakes are among the more elaborate cakes seen in the United Kingdom. Most recently in 2011, Prince William and his bride Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, had a wedding cake that was eight tiers.\n\n"}

For instance, one could say, \"X has a vast hinterland\", or \"Y has no hinterland\". The spread of this usage is usually credited to Denis Healey (British Defence Secretary 1964–1970, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1974–1979) and his wife Edna Healey, initially in the context of the supposed lack of hinterland of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\n"}

Many people now use crouton for croute, so the usage has changed. Historically, however, a croute was a slice of a baguette lightly brushed with oil or clarified butter and baked. In French cooking, \"croûte\" is not only a noun but also has a verb form which describes the cooking process that transforms the bread into the crust.\n\nThe preparation of croutons is relatively simple. Typically the cubes of bread are lightly coated in oil or butter (which may be seasoned or flavored for variety) and then baked. Some commercial preparations use machinery to sprinkle various seasonings on them. Alternatively, they may be fried lightly in butter or vegetable oil, until crisp and brown, to give them a buttery flavor and crunchy texture. Some croutons are prepared with the addition of cheese.\n\nNearly any type of bread—in a loaf or pre-sliced, with or without crust—may be used to make croutons. Dry or stale bread or leftover bread is usually used instead of fresh bread. Once prepared, the croutons will remain fresh far longer than unprepared bread.\n\nA dish prepared \"à la Grenobloise\" (in the Grenoble manner) has a garnish of small croutons along with brown butter, capers, parsley, and lemon.\n\nDried and cubed bread is commonly sold in large bags in North America to make Thanksgiving holiday stuffing or dressing, although these are generally different from salad croutons, being only dry bread instead of buttered or oiled and with different seasonings, if any.\n"}
{"id": "395365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=395365", "title": "Nasi lemak", "text": "Nasi lemak\n\nNasi lemak is a Malay fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish; it is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore; Brunei, and Southern Thailand. In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra; especially Malay realm of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan. \"Nasi lemak\" can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao prepared by Filipino Moro. It is considered one of the most famous dishes for a Malay-style breakfast. It is not to be confused with \"nasi dagang\", sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan (and its kindred region in Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand and Natuna in Indonesia), although both dishes are often served for breakfast. However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day.\n\n\"Nasi lemak\" was mentioned in a book \"The Circumstances of Malay Life\", written by Sir Richard Olof Winstedt in 1909.\nWith roots in Malay culture and Malay cuisine, its name in Malay literally means \"oily or fatty rice\", but is taken in this context to mean \"rich\" or \"creamy\". The name is derived from the cooking process whereby rice is soaked in coconut cream and then the mixture steamed. The rice is normally cooked with pandan leaves that gives it a distinctive flavour.\n\nTraditionally, nasi lemak is served with a hot spicy sauce (\"sambal\"), and usually includes various garnishes, including fresh cucumber slices, small fried anchovies (\"ikan bilis\"), roasted peanuts, and hard-boiled or fried egg. As a more substantial meal, \"nasi lemak\" may also be served with an additional protein dish such as \"ayam goreng\" (fried chicken), \"sambal sotong\" (cuttlefish in chili), small fried fish, cockles, and on special occasions rendang daging (beef) stewed in coconut milk and spices). Other accompaniments include stir fried water convolvulus (\"kangkong\"), and spicy pickled vegetables salad acar. Traditionally most of these accompaniments are spicy in nature.\n\nNasi lemak is widely eaten in Malaysia and Singapore. More commonly consumed as breakfast in both countries, it is commonly sold at hawker food centres and roadside stalls in Malaysia and Singapore. In Indonesia, nasi lemak is a favourite local breakfast fare; especially in Eastern Sumatra (Riau Islands, Riau and Jambi provinces). In Palembang, it is also a favourite local dish with the name \"nasi gemuk\". In palembangnese Malay, \"gemuk\" has the same meaning as \"lemak\". This unique dish often comes wrapped in banana leaves, newspaper or brown paper, or in some shops is served on a plate. However, owing to its popularity there are restaurants which serve it as a noon or evening meal, making it possible for the dish to be eaten all day. \"Nasi lemak kukus\" which means \"steamed nasi lemak\" is another name given to nasi lemak served with steamed rice. In Malaysia, nasi lemak can also be found in a \"pasar malam\" (night market) with a variety of dishes.\n\nOn 31 January 2019, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating nasi lemak.\n\nIn March 2016, \"nasi lemak\" was mentioned as one of the 10 healthy international breakfast foods by TIME magazine. This opinion however, might be misleading, since the writer might be referring to its relatively \"healthier\" and smaller version and in comparison to large American breakfast (fried bacon, eggs, pancakes/hash browns). A single, full size serving of \"nasi lemak\" with additional fried chicken, meat or fish, can be between 800 and well over 1,000 calories. The savoury coconut milk-infused rice also contains saturated fat, an ingredient connected to health problems, including diabetes.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, nasi lemak comes in many variations as they are prepared by different chefs from different cultures. The original nasi lemak in Malaysia is arguably a typical Southern and Central Peninsular Malaysia breakfast, and is considered of Malay origin. However, due to the popularity of the dish, it is regarded as a national dish.\n\nThe rice cooked in coconut milk is actually common in Southeast Asia. This is the same process used to make similar rice dishes from their neighbouring country Indonesia, which are \"nasi uduk\" from Jakarta, \"nasi gurih\" from Aceh and Javanese \"nasi liwet\". However, there are differences in taste because knotted leaves of Pandan screwpine are steamed with the rice to impart flavour and fragrance. Less often other spices such as ginger and occasionally herbs like lemon grass may be added for additional fragrance.\n\nNasi lemak in the Northern West Peninsular tends to include curry. The sambal tends to range from fiery hot to mildly hot with a sweet under taste. Nasi lemak is not as popular as the indigenous \"nasi berlauk\", \"nasi dagang\", and \"nasi kerabu\" in North East Peninsular Malaysia. It is regarded as a speciality imported dish in Sabah and Sarawak. Hotels often feature nasi lemak on their menu with elaborate dishes, such as beef rendang and the addition of other seafood. Hawker centres in Singapore and Malaysia usually wrap them in banana leaves to enhance the flavour. Roadside stalls sell them ready packed, known as \"nasi lemak bungkus\", with minimal additions that cost between RM 1.50 – 6.00 per pack. Seafood outlets often serve the basic nasi lemak to accompany barbecued seafood. There are Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian versions, and Singaporean Malay and Singaporean Chinese versions. Some people suggest that sambal is the most important part of a nasi lemak meal. If not prepared properly, it could ruin the dish, since Malaysians love food that is hot and spicy. A good deal of spirited and good-natured debate exists around this point.\n\nThis traditional favourite offers sambal, \"ikan bilis\" (anchovies), peanuts and boiled egg. This is the most traditional version. Nasi lemak stalls can be found serving them with fried egg, \"sambal kerang\" (cockles) - a local favourite, sambal squids, sambal fish, chicken or chicken/beef rendang, squid fritters or even fried chicken or fish. It can be consumed for breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea, dinner and even supper. (In Malaysia this meal is usually consumed during morning, nasi lemak hawkers can be seen anywhere nearby schools, offices etc..)\n\nThe special part about it is the rice. The rice can be cooked with fresh coconut milk, and sometimes with pandanus leaf (screwpine) thrown in. The rice is served on banana leaves, so it smells naturally fragrant when eaten. This traditional serving style has been inherited for many generations -- from a little stall at road side to commercials, it seems like a simple way fulfill the crave towards this traditional food in cities.\n\nThe Malaysian Indian variation is similar to the original version. However, many Malaysian Indians are Hindus, and thus do not eat beef. Nasi lemak in the Malaysian Indian version is served with curry, such as chicken curry, fish curry or lamb curry. Moreover, Malaysian Indians also serve a rendition of the dish alongside their very own version of Rendang.\n\nAlthough it is not common to see Malaysian Chinese stalls and restaurants selling nasi lemak, there is a non-halal version that contains pork, sold in towns and cities such as Malacca and certain parts of Kuala Lumpur. Some Malaysian Chinese hawkers are known to make minced pork sambal.\n\nRight across the Malacca Strait, the Malay Indonesians of Sumatran east coast shares close kinship and common Malay cuisine heritage with their Malaysian counterpart. As the result, nasi lemak is also native cuisine to Riau Island and Riau province. In archipelagic region like Riau Islands province of Indonesia, usually seafood are used to accompany nasi lemak, such as \"ikan bilis\" (anchovy), \"ikan tamban\" (\"Sardinella longiceps\"), \"ikan selar kuning\" (\"Selaroides leptolepis\"), \"sotong\" or \"cumi-cumi\" (squid) or small prawns. The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (\"ikan bilis\"), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (\"sambal\"). The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as \"ikan tamban\", usually fried with \"sambal\" chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible. Prawns and squids are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as \"sambal udang\" or \"sambal cumi\". In Indonesia, nasi lemak is often sprinkled with \"bawang goreng\" (crispy fried shallot granules).\n\nIn Pekanbaru city in Sumatran province of Riau however, freshwater river fishes are commonly used as \"lauk\" to accompany nasi lemak. The freshwater fishes includes \"ikan selais\" (\"Kryptopterus cryptopterus\") and \"ikan patin\" (\"Pangasius\"). Other fish such as \"ikan lomek\" (\"Harpadon nehereus\") is also commonly used. These fishes are usually cooked in Minang style \"lado ijo\" (green chili pepper), minced and fried as \"perkedel ikan\", or just plainly fried.\n\nMedan \"Melayu Deli\" \"nasi lemak\" version usually served with choice of side dishes either \"rendang\" (beef or chicken) or \"balado\" (egg or shrimp in chili sauce). A set of complete Medan's \"nasi lemak\" includes sprinkle of crispy fried shallot, slices of omelette, \"kripik kentang balado\" (spicy potato chips), \"tempe orek\" (seasoned fried tempeh), \"perkedel\" (fried potato patties), \"sambal\" chili paste, slices of cucumber, and slightly bitter \"emping\" cracker. Some traditional restaurant chains have dedicated their business to serving \"nasi lemak Medan\". Next to \"rendang\" and \"balado\", vegetable dish \"sayur masak lemak\" (vegetables including long beans, cabbage, and long green chilies in coconut milk) is also offered. It is a popular street food in Medan sold in humble tarp tent \"warung\", and usually sold together with \"Lontong Medan\". Since Medan is located near Aceh border, and there are numbers of Aceh people resides in the city, the term \"nasi lemak\" and \"nasi gurih\" are often used interchangeably in the city, since the terms refer to a similar coconut rice dish.\n\nFor most of the Singaporean Malay variation, the sambal of the nasi lemak has more of a sweeter and less spicy taste when compared to other variations. As the sambal is a crucial portion of the nasi lemak, it is preferred to be less spicy so as not to overpower the taste of the coconut based rice and the other ingredients. The sides to this dish includes ikan bilis (anchovies), peanuts and an omelette or fried egg, which is rather similar to the Malaysian version, although the use of a boiled egg as with the Malaysian version is somewhat less common. Occasionally, a variant using the long grain basmati rice may also be found.\n\nRetaining the familiar aroma of pandan leaves, the Singaporean Chinese variation comes with a variety of sides that includes deep fried drumstick, chicken franks, fish cake, curried vegetables and tongsan luncheon meat. There is also the traditional way of serving it with just the ikan bilis (anchovies), peanuts and fried egg similar to the Malaysian version. Sometimes the rice is also coloured emerald green with the use of screwpine leaf extract or essence, commonly called pandan leaves, that perfumes the rice with a nice fragrance when added to the rice with the coconut milk as well as giving it its bright green colour. The use of the colour may have arisen as a gimmick to entice customers.\n\nIn certain parts of Malaysia, hawkers also offer vegetarian nasi lemak in which the dried anchovies are substituted with vegetarian mock anchovies.\n\nIn the Southern Thailand town of Betong, the nasi lemak is served with tom yam sauce.\n"}

This was originally a Spanish usage, but the dish is now best known in the United States in a Latin American context. Elsewhere, including in Britain, a flan is a type of tart somewhat like a quiche.\n\nThe Modern English word \"flan\" comes from French \"flan\", from Old French \"flaon\", in turn from Medieval Latin \"fladonem\", derived from the Old High German \"flado\", a sort of flat cake, probably from an Indo-European root for 'flat' or 'broad'. The North American sense of \"flan\" as \"crème caramel\" was borrowed from Latin American Spanish.\n\nCrème caramel is a variant of plain custard (crème) where sugar syrup cooked to caramel stage is poured into the mold before adding the custard base. It is usually cooked in a bain-marie on a stove top or in the oven in a water bath. It is turned and served with the caramel sauce on top, hence the alternate French name \"crème caramel renversée\".\n\nTurning out larger dishes requires care, as the custard easily splits. Larger dishes also require more care to avoid undercooking the interior or overcooking the exterior. Thus, crème caramel is often cooked and served in ramekins. The objective being to obtain a homogeneous and smooth cream on the surface of the \"crème caramel\", and that the base, being the caramel, remains liquid after being cooked in a bain-marie. Therefore, the importance of cooking it in a bain-marie to avoid that the caramel gets burned which would bring a taste of carbonization to the dessert.\n\nAn imitation of crème caramel may be prepared from \"instant flan powder\", which is thickened with agar or carrageenan rather than eggs. In some Latin American countries, the true custard version is known as \"milk flan\" (flan de leche) or even \"milk cheese\", and the substitute version is known as just \"flan\".\n\nCaramel custard is popular, especially in the larger coastal cities, and in former Portuguese colonies such as Goa, Daman and Diu. Sometimes, masala chai is added. It is a staple on restaurant menus in the beach resorts along India's coasts and also prepared regularly in the home kitchens of the Anglo-Indian Goan, Malayali, Mangalorean and Parsi communities.\n\nPackaged crème caramel is ubiquitous in Japanese convenience stores under the name (i.e., \"pudding\"), or \"custard pudding\". The same kind of dessert are sold in convenience stores in Taiwan.\n\nCaramel custard is a very popular dessert in Malaysia. First introduced by the Portuguese in the 1500s and sold year-round today, this dessert is popular served in restaurants, cafes, hotels and even Ramadan bazaars for breaking the fast.\n\nIn the Philippines, flan is known as \"leche\" flan (the local term for the originally Spanish \"flan de leche\", literally \"milk \"flan\"\"), which is a heavier version of the Spanish dish, made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. \"Leche\" flan is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top in an oval-shaped tin mold known as \"llanera\" (also spelled \"lyanera\"), although rarely it can also be baked. \"Leche\" flan is a staple dessert in celebratory feasts.\n\nAn even heavier version, called \"tocino de cielo\" or \"tocino del cielo\" (Spanish for \"heaven's bacon\"), is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar.\n\nCrème caramel was introduced by the French and is common in Vietnam. It is known as \"bánh caramel\", \"caramen\" or \"kem caramel\" in northern Vietnam or \"bánh flan\" or \"kem flan\" in southern Vietnam. Variations include serving with black coffee poured on top, or browning the caramel past typical caramelization point to make a darker, more bitter \"burnt caramel\".\n\nMost notably in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, crème caramel is usually eaten with \"dulce de leche\", whipped cream, or both (\"flan mixto\"). In Chile, it is often eaten with \"dulce de membrillo\" (quince jelly) or condensed milk. Also at most equatorial and Caribbean countries the inclusion of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk is widespread.\n\nIn Venezuela and Brazil, it is often made with condensed milk, milk, eggs and sugar caramelized on top. The Venezuelan version is known as \"quesillo\" (\"small cheese\") and in Brazil, it is known as \"pudim de leite condensado\" (\"condensed milk pudding\").\n\nFlan in Costa Rica often features coconut or coffee (flan de café).\n\nCuban flan \"Flan de Cuba\" is made with the addition of the whites of two eggs and a cinnamon stick. A similar Cuban dish is \"Copa Lolita\", a small caramel flan served with one or two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. Other variations include coconut or rum raisin topping.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, only egg yolks are used and mixed with vanilla, evaporated milk and condensed milk. Coconut flan is known as \"quesillo\".\n\nIn Mexico, a variation of flan called \"Flan Napolitano\" is made, where cream cheese is added to the recipe to create a creamier version.\n\nMost Puerto Rican flans are milk based. Some are coconut-based and called \"flan de coco\", made with both condensed milk and coconut milk or with cream of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk. Beaten egg white foam is used to lighten the mixture. Coconut flan is usually seasoned with cinnamon, rum and vanilla.\n\nAround the Thanksgiving holiday it is popular to add pumpkin, ñame purée, or breadfruit along with spices like ginger, vanilla, cinnamon to the flan. A combination of pumpkin, coconut, sweet potato, carrot and almond extract flan is unique and only served on Thanksgiving.\n\nAnother popular flan is \"flancocho\", flavored with a layer of cream cheese and Puerto Rican style sponge cake underneath. The flancocho can also be made with cream cheese and cake batter worked into the flan mix.\n\n\n"}

Unlike the writing table the trestle desk is supported by two legs instead of four, and the legs are designed to be dismantled easily in order to store or move the desk efficiently. More precisely, the two legs are two strong side supports which branch out in two feet each (for a total of four) at the bottom. \n\nSome antique trestle desks are fitted with small cubbyholes and nooks or small drawers at the extremity of the work surface, and thus resemble a bureau à gradin.\n\nAs with most antique desk forms, this trestle desk surface is usually 29 inches (73.7 cm) from the floor.\n\nThe modern trestle desk is not so much a desk form as a desk improvisation. In shape and manufacture it sometimes resembles certain variations of the antique field desk which was used by officers not too far from the battlefield. Basically, the modern trestle desk improv is a plank of wood set on two trestles.\n\nIt is eminently portable, and eminently practical, when care is taken to provide stable trestles. The advent of the cubicle desk created a market for independent desk elements of all kinds, such as short, rolling filing cabinets. These proved suitable for use under a trestle desk and encouraged improvisation.\n\nDuring the heyday of the dot-com boom, many companies liked to go to the extremes in office furnishings. Some would stock rooms with expensive Aeron chairs and the most lavish type of ergonomic desk available, while others would have their employees sit on boxes and work on desks made of used doors set on old trestles or crates. Others still mixed the costly and the cheap, sometimes to the advantage of the user, by doing things like picking good quality chairs and making cheap but sturdy trestle desk improvisations. These activities popularised the trestle desk as a desk form, and some of this survived after the dot-com burst in the year 2000.\n\nFor instance, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and top Amazon executives usually worked on doors set on trestle supports, as a visible example of a frugal company culture.\n\nIn the United States, a desk or a table set on X-shaped trestles is sometimes called a sawbuck table.\n\nSee also the list of desk forms and types.\n\n"}

It may contain other vegetables like bean sprouts, garlic chives, pickled radishes or turnips, and raw banana flowers. It may also contain fresh shrimp, crab, squid, chicken or other animal products. Many of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments such as the red chili pepper, lime wedges, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts and other miscellaneous fresh vegetables. Vegetarian versions may substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce and omit the shrimp.\n\nA dish of stir-fried rice noodles is thought by some to have been introduced to Ayutthaya during the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom by Chinese traders and subsequently altered to reflect Thai flavor profiles.\n\nDuring World War II, Thailand suffered a rice shortage due to the war and floods. To reduce domestic rice consumption, the Thai government under Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram promoted consumption of noodles instead. His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the identity of Thailand. As a result, a new noodle called \"sen chan\" (named after Chanthaburi Province) was created. Pad thai has since become one of Thailand's national dishes. Today, some food vendors add pork or chicken (although the original recipe did not contain pork because of the government's perception that pork was a Chinese meat).

{"id": "399059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399059", "title": "Nikāya", "text": "Nikāya\n\nNikāya is a Pāli word meaning \"volume\". It is often used like the Sanskrit word \"āgama\" to mean \"collection\", \"assemblage\", \"class\" or \"group\" in both Pāḷi and Sanskrit. It is most commonly used in reference to the Buddhist texts of the Sutta Piṭaka but can also refer to the monastic divisions of Theravāda Buddhism.\n\nIn addition, the term \"Nikāya\" is sometimes used in contemporary scholarship to refer to early Buddhist schools.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, particularly, the \"Discourse Basket\" or \"Sutta Piṭaka\", the meaning of \"nikāya\" is roughly equivalent to the English \"collection\" and is used to describe groupings of discourses according to theme, length, or other categories. For example, the \"Sutta Piṭaka\" is broken up into five nikāyas:\n\nIn the other early Buddhist schools the alternate term \"āgama\" was used instead of nikāya to describe their \"Sutra Piṭaka\"s. Thus the non-Mahāyāna portion of the Sanskrit-language \"Sutra Piṭaka\" is referred to as \"the Āgamas\" by Mahāyāna Buddhists. The Āgamas survive for the most part only in Classical Tibetan and Chinese translation. They correspond closely with the Pāḷi nikāyas.\n\nAmong the Theravāda nations of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka, \"nikāya\" is also used as the term for a monastic division or lineage; these groupings are also sometimes called \"monastic fraternities\" or \"frateries\". Nikāyas may emerge among monastic groupings as a result of royal or government patronage (such as the Dhammayuttika Nikāya of Thailand, due to the national origin of their ordination lineage (the Siam Nikāya of Sri Lanka), because of differences in the interpretation of the monastic code, or due to other factors (such as the Amarapura Nikāya in Sri Lanka, which emerged as a reaction to caste restrictions within the Siam Nikāya). These divisions do not rise to the level of forming separate sects within the Theravāda tradition, because they do not typically follow different doctrines or monastic codes, nor do these divisions extend to the laity.\n\nIn Burma, nikaya monastic orders have emerged in response to the relative conservativeness with which the Vinayas are interpreted, and the hierarchical structure within the nikaya. Since 1980, no new nikayas have been allowed, and there are a total of nine legally recognized monastic orders in Burma today under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. The largest of these is the Thudhamma Nikaya, which was founded in the 1800s during the Konbaung Dynasty.\n\n\n"}

Beginning with the First Sunday of Advent, the lighting of a candle can be accompanied by a Bible reading, devotional time and prayers. An additional candle is lit during each subsequent week until, by the last Sunday before Christmas, all four candles are lit. Many Advent wreaths include a fifth, Christ candle which is lit at Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The custom is observed both in family settings and at public church services.\n\nThe concept of the Advent wreath originated among German Lutherans in the 16th Century. However, it was not until three centuries later that the modern Advent wreath took shape.\nResearch by Prof. Haemig of Luther Seminary, St. Paul, points to Johann Hinrich Wichern (1808–1881), a Protestant pastor in Germany and a pioneer in urban mission work among the poor as the inventor of the modern Advent wreath in the 19th century. During Advent, children at the mission school \"Rauhes Haus\", founded by Wichern in Hamburg, would ask daily if Christmas had arrived. In 1839, he built a large wooden ring (made out of an old cartwheel) with 20 small red and 4 large white candles. A small candle was lit successively every weekday and Saturday during Advent. On Sundays, a large white candle was lit. The custom gained ground among Protestant churches in Germany and evolved into the smaller wreath with four or five candles known today. Roman Catholics in Germany began to adopt the custom in the 1920s, and in the 1930s it spread to North America. Professor Haemig's research also indicates that the custom did not reach the United States until the 1930s, even among German Lutheran immigrants.\n\nIn Medieval times Advent was a period of fasting during which people's thoughts were directed to the expected second coming of Christ; but in modern times many have forgotten this meaning and it has instead been primarily seen as the lead up to Christmas, and in that context Advent Wreath serves as a reminder of the approach of the feast.\n\nIn 1964, an Advent crown made at home from wire coathangers and tinsel, appeared on the bi-weekly children's TV program \"Blue Peter\". This 'make' became one of the program's most iconic, repeated each year, and was the introduction of this tradition to most of the broadly Anglican audience. In later years, the candles were replaced by baubles, out of concern over fire.\n\nMore recently, some Eastern Orthodox families have adopted an Advent wreath with six candles symbolizing the longer Christmas fast in Orthodox tradition, which corresponds to Advent in Western Christianity.\n\nAdvent wreaths are circular, representing God's infinite love, and are usually made of evergreen leaves, which \"represent the hope of eternal life brought by Jesus Christ.\" Within the Advent wreath are candles that generally represent the four weeks of the Advent season as well as \"the light of God coming into the world through the birth of Jesus Christ\" although each of the candles has its own significance as well; individually, the candles specifically symbolize the Christian concepts of hope (week one), peace (week two), joy (week three) and love (week four) in many traditions. Many Advent wreaths also have a white candle in the centre to symbolize the arrival of Christmastide, sometimes known as the \"Christ candle.\" It is lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The Christ candle is coloured white because this is the traditional festal colour in the Western Church.\n\nIn many Catholic and Protestant churches, the most popular colours for the four surrounding Advent candles are violet and rose, corresponding with the colors of the liturgical vestments for the Sundays of Advent. For denominations of the Western Christian Church, violet is the historic liturgical color for three of the four Sundays of Advent: Violet is the traditional color of penitential seasons. Blue is also a popular alternative color for both Advent vestments and Advent candles, especially in some Anglican and American Methodist churches, which use a blue shade associated with the Sarum rite, in addition to Lutheran churches that also implement this practice. One interpretation holds that blue means hope and waiting, which aligns with the seasonal meaning of Advent. Rose is the liturgical color for the Third Sunday of Advent, known as Gaudete Sunday from the Latin word meaning \"to rejoice\"—also from the first line of the traditional entrance prayer (called the Introit) for the Mass or Worship Service of the third Sunday of Advent; it is a pause from the penitential spirit of Advent. As such, the third candle, representing joy, is often a different color from the other three.\n\nIn other Protestant churches, especially in the United Kingdom, it is more common for Advent wreaths to have four red candles (reflecting their traditional use in Christmas decorations). An Advent wreath given to Pope Benedict XVI of the Catholic Church also had four red candles.\n\nIn the UK, the four red advent candles are often linked to the Sunday Revised Common Lectionary readings for Advent, each candle representing those looking forward to the coming of Christ: the hope of all God's people (week one), the Old Testament prophets (week two), John the Baptist (week three) and Mary the mother of Jesus (week four).\n\n\n"}

He is said to have created the first batch on July 3, 1916, in his small roadside restaurant, now Woodman's of Essex. One of his specialties was potato chips, so he had large vats for deep-frying. He used the clams, which he had collected himself from the mud flats of the Essex River located close to his home.\n\nLater, Thomas Soffron, of Soffron Brothers Clam Co., based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, created clam strips, which are made from the \"foot\" of hard-shelled sea clams.

{"id": "403936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403936", "title": "Christmas pudding", "text": "Christmas pudding\n\nChristmas pudding is a type of pudding traditionally served as part of the Christmas dinner in the UK, Ireland and in other countries where it has been brought by British immigrants. It has its origins in medieval England, and is sometimes known as plum pudding or just \"pud\", though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit. Despite the name \"plum pudding\", the pudding contains no actual plums due to the pre-Victorian use of the word \"plums\" as a term for raisins. The pudding is composed of many dried fruits held together by egg and suet, sometimes moistened by treacle or molasses and flavoured with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and other spices. The pudding is usually aged for a month or more, or even a year; the high alcohol content of the pudding prevents it from spoiling during this time.\n\nMany households have their own recipe for Christmas pudding, some handed down through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients — notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with suet. It is very dark in appearance — very nearly black — as a result of the dark sugars and black treacle in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, brandy and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark beers such as mild, stout or porter).\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth, and often represented as round. The new Victorian era fashion involved putting the batter into a basin and then steaming it, followed by unwrapping the pudding, placing it on a platter, and decorating the top with a sprig of holly.\n\nInitial cooking usually involves steaming for many hours. Most pre-twentieth century recipes assume that the pudding will then be served immediately, but in the second half of the twentieth century, it became more usual to reheat puddings on the day of serving, and recipes changed slightly to allow for maturing. To serve, the pudding is reheated by steaming once more, and dressed with warm brandy which is set alight. It can be eaten with hard sauce (usually brandy butter or rum butter), cream, lemon cream, ice cream, custard, or sweetened béchamel, and is sometimes sprinkled with caster sugar.\n\nAn example of a Great Depression era recipe for Christmas pudding can instead be made on Christmas Day rather than weeks before as with a traditional plum pudding, although it is still boiled or steamed. Given the scarce resources available to poorer households during the depression this recipe uses cold tea for flavouring instead of brandy and there are no eggs used in the mixture. This recipe is not as heavy as a traditional plum pudding and it is still being cooked by Australian families.\n\nMany families now buy their puddings ready-made from shops and they can be reheated in a microwave oven with a much shorter cooking time.\n\nThere is a popular myth that plum pudding's association with Christmas goes back to a custom in medieval England that the \"pudding should be made on the 25th Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the Magi and their journey in that direction\". However, recipes for plum puddings appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. The collect for the Sunday before Advent in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer begins with the words \"\"Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works...\"\". This led to the custom of preparing Christmas puddings on that day which became known as Stir-up Sunday.\nChristmas pudding's possible ancestors include savoury puddings such as those in Harleian MS 279, crustades, malaches whyte, creme boiled (a kind of stirred custard), and sippets. Various ingredients and methods of these older recipes appear in early plum puddings. An early example of a bag pudding (without fruit) is \"fraunche mele\" in the Liber Cure Cocorum. Pudding predecessors often contained meat, as well as sweet ingredients, and prior to being steamed in a cloth the ingredients may have been stuffed into the gut or stomach of an animal - like the Scottish haggis or sausages.\n\nOne of the earliest plum pudding recipes is given by Mary Kettilby in her 1714 book \"A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery\".\n\nThere is a popular and wholly unsubstantiated myth that in 1714, King George I (sometimes known as the Pudding King) requested that plum pudding be served as part of his royal feast in his first Christmas in England. As techniques for meat preserving improved in the 18th century, the savoury element of both the mince pie and the plum pottage diminished as the sweet content increased. People began adding dried fruit and sugar. The mince pie kept its name, though the pottage was increasingly referred to as \"plum pudding\". Although the latter was always a celebratory dish it was originally eaten at the Harvest festival, not Christmas. It was not until the 1830s that the cannonball of flour, fruits, suet, sugar and spices, all topped with holly, made a definite appearance, becoming more and more associated with Christmas. The East Sussex cook Eliza Acton was the first to refer to it as \"Christmas Pudding\" in her bestselling 1845 book \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\".\n\nThe pudding \"had the great merit\" of not needing to be cooked in an oven, something \"most lower class households did not have\".\n\nThroughout the colonial period, the pudding was a symbol of unity throughout the British Empire. In 1927, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB) wrote a letter to the Master of the Royal Household, requesting a copy of the recipe used to make the Christmas pudding for the royal family. The King and Queen granted Leo Amery, the head of the EMB, permission to use the recipe in a publication in the following November. The royal chef, Henry Cédard, provided the recipe.\n\nIn order to distribute the recipe, the EMB had to overcome two challenges: size and ingredients. First, the original recipe was measured to serve 40 people, including the entire royal family and their guests. The EMB was challenged to rework the recipe to serve only 8 people. Second, the ingredients used to make the pudding had to be changed to reflect the ideals of the Empire. The origins of each ingredient had to be carefully manipulated to represent each of the Empire's many colonies. Brandy from Cyprus and nutmeg from the West Indies, which had been inadvertently forgotten in previous recipes, made special appearances. Unfortunately, there were a number of colonies that produced the same foodstuffs.\n\nThe final recipe included Australian currants, South African stoned raisins, Canadian apples, Jamaican rum, and English Beer, among other ingredients all sourced from somewhere in the Empire.\n\nAfter finalizing the ingredients, the royal recipe was sent out to national newspapers and to popular women's magazines. Copies were also printed and handed out to the public for free. The recipe was a phenomenal success, as thousands of requests for the recipe flooded the EMB office.\n\nThe custom of eating Christmas pudding was carried to many parts of the world by British colonists. It is a common dish in the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, and [though it is often eaten in many other countries. In America, the traditions of the Christmas Pudding had already arrived in pre-revolutionary days. A book entitled 'The Williamsburg Art of Cookery' by Mrs Helen Bullock was published in the U.S. as early as 1742. Among the ingredients she includes a pound of each of a variety of dried fruits and sugar, plus 1/2lb each of candied peel (citron, orange and lemon). She also adds 1 pint of brandy & 12 eggs.\n\nIn the late Victorian period a tradition grew up that Christmas puddings should be made on or immediately after the Sunday \"next before Advent\", i.e. four to five weeks before Christmas. The collect for that Sunday in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, as it was used from the 16th century (and still is in traditional churches), reads:\n\nInitially probably a schoolchild joke, latterly the day became known as \"Stir-up Sunday\". By the 1920s the custom was established that everyone in the household, or at least every child (and sometimes the servants), gave the mixture a stir and made a wish while doing so.\n\nIt was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them. The usual choice was a silver threepence or a sixpence. The coin was believed to bring wealth in the coming year, and came from an earlier tradition, defunct by the twentieth century, wherein tokens were put in a cake (see Twelfth Cake).\n\nOther tokens are also known to have been included, such as a tiny wishbone (to bring good luck), a silver thimble (for thrift), or an anchor (to symbolise safe harbour).\n\nOnce turned out of its basin, decorated with holly, doused in brandy (or occasionally rum), and flamed (or \"fired\"), the pudding is traditionally brought to the table ceremoniously, and greeted with a round of applause. In 1843, Charles Dickens describes the scene in \"A Christmas Carol\":\n\n\"Mrs Cratchit left the room alone – too nervous to bear witnesses – to take the pudding up and bring it in... Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper which smells like a washing-day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that. That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered – flushed, but smiling proudly – with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\"\n\nChristmas puddings have very good keeping properties and many families keep one back from Christmas to be eaten at another celebration later in the year, often at Easter. Constance Spry records that it was not uncommon to go so far as to make each year's pudding the \"previous\" Christmas.\n\n"}

A formal language can be identified with the set of formulas in the language.\n\nA formula is a syntactic object that can be given a semantic meaning by means of an interpretation. Two key uses of formulas are in propositional logic and predicate logic.\n\nA key use of formulas is in propositional logic and predicate logic such as first-order logic. In those contexts, a formula is a string of symbols φ for which it makes sense to ask \"is φ true?\", once any free variables in φ have been instantiated. In formal logic, proofs can be represented by sequences of formulas with certain properties, and the final formula in the sequence is what is proven.\n\nAlthough the term \"formula\" may be used for written marks (for instance, on a piece of paper or chalkboard), it is more precisely understood as the sequence of symbols being expressed, with the marks being a token instance of formula. Thus the same formula may be written more than once, and a formula might in principle be so long that it cannot be written at all within the physical universe.\n\nFormulas themselves are syntactic objects. They are given meanings by interpretations. For example, in a propositional formula, each propositional variable may be interpreted as a concrete proposition, so that the overall formula expresses a relationship between these propositions. A formula need not be interpreted, however, to be considered solely as a formula.\n\nThe formulas of propositional calculus, also called propositional formulas, are expressions such as formula_1. Their definition begins with the arbitrary choice of a set \"V\" of propositional variables. The alphabet consists of the letters in \"V\" along with the symbols for the propositional connectives and parentheses \"(\" and \")\", all of which are assumed to not be in \"V\". The formulas will be certain expressions (that is, strings of symbols) over this alphabet.\n\nThe formulas are inductively defined as follows:\n\nThis definition can also be written as a formal grammar in Backus–Naur form, provided the set of variables is finite:\n\nUsing this grammar, the sequence of symbols\nis a formula, because it is grammatically correct. The sequence of symbols\nis not a formula, because it does not conform to the grammar.\n\nA complex formula may be difficult to read, owing to, for example, the proliferation of parentheses. To alleviate this last phenomenon, precedence rules (akin to the standard mathematical order of operations) are assumed among the operators, making some operators more binding than others. For example, assuming the precedence (from most binding to least binding) 1. ¬   2. →  3. ∧  4. ∨. Then the formula\nmay be abbreviated as\nThis is, however, only a convention used to simplify the written representation of a formula. If the precedence was assumed, for example, to be left-right associative, in following order: 1. ¬   2. ∧  3. ∨  4. →, then the same formula above (without parentheses) would be rewritten as\n\nThe definition of a formula in first-order logic formula_2 is relative to the signature of the theory at hand. This signature specifies the constant symbols, relation symbols, and function symbols of the theory at hand, along with the arities of the function and relation symbols.\n\nThe definition of a formula comes in several parts. First, the set of terms is defined recursively. Terms, informally, are expressions that represent objects from the domain of discourse.\n\nThe next step is to define the atomic formulas.\n\nFinally, the set of formulas is defined to be the smallest set containing the set of atomic formulas such that the following holds:\n\nIf a formula has no occurrences of formula_17 or formula_18, for any variable formula_10, then it is called \"quantifier-free\". An \"existential formula\" is a formula starting with a sequence of existential quantification followed by a quantifier-free formula.\n\nAn \"atomic formula\" is a formula that contains no logical connectives nor quantifiers, or equivalently a formula that has no strict subformulas.\nThe precise form of atomic formulas depends on the formal system under consideration; for propositional logic, for example, the atomic formulas are the propositional variables. For predicate logic, the atoms are predicate symbols together with their arguments, each argument being a term.\n\nAccording to some terminology, an \"open formula\" is formed by combining atomic formulas using only logical connectives, to the exclusion of quantifiers. This has not to be confused with a formula which is not closed.\n\nA \"closed formula\", also \"ground formula\" or \"sentence\", is a formula in which there are no free occurrences of any variable. If A is a formula of a first-order language in which the variables \"v\", ..., \"v\" have free occurrences, then A preceded by \"v\" ... \"v\" is a closure of A.\n\n\nIn earlier works on mathematical logic (e.g. by Church), formulas referred to any strings of symbols and among these strings, well-formed formulas were the strings that followed the formation rules of (correct) formulas.\n\nSeveral authors simply say formula. Modern usages (especially in the context of computer science with mathematical software such as model checkers, automated theorem provers, interactive theorem provers) tend to retain of the notion of formula only the algebraic concept and to leave the question of well-formedness, i.e. of the concrete string representation of formulas (using this or that symbol for connectives and quantifiers, using this or that parenthesizing convention, using Polish or infix notation, etc.) as a mere notational problem.\n\nWhile the expression \"well-formed formula\" is still in use, these authors do not necessarily use it in contradistinction to the old sense of \"formula\", which is no longer common in mathematical logic.\n\nThe expression \"well-formed formulas\" (WFF) also crept into popular culture. \"WFF\" is part of an esoteric pun used in the name of the academic game \"WFF 'N PROOF: The Game of Modern Logic,\" by Layman Allen, developed while he was at Yale Law School (he was later a professor at the University of Michigan). The suite of games is designed to teach the principles of symbolic logic to children (in Polish notation). Its name is an echo of \"whiffenpoof\", a nonsense word used as a cheer at Yale University made popular in \"The Whiffenpoof Song\" and The Whiffenpoofs.\n\n\n\n"}

These elementary particles mediate the weak interaction; the respective symbols are , , and . The W bosons have either a positive or negative electric charge of 1 elementary charge and are each other's antiparticles. The Z boson is electrically neutral and is its own antiparticle. The three particles have a spin of 1. The W bosons have a magnetic moment, but the Z has none. All three of these particles are very short-lived, with a half-life of about . Their experimental discovery was a triumph for what is now known as the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nThe W bosons are named after the weak force. The physicist Steven Weinberg named the additional particle the \"Z particle\", and later gave the explanation that it was the last additional particle needed by the model. The W bosons had already been named, and the Z bosons have zero electric charge.\n\nThe two W bosons are verified mediators of neutrino absorption and emission. During these processes, the W boson charge induces electron or positron emission or absorption, thus causing nuclear transmutation. The Z boson is not involved in the absorption or emission of electrons and positrons.\n\nThe Z boson mediates the transfer of momentum, spin and energy when neutrinos scatter \"elastically\" from matter (a process which conserves charge). Such behavior is almost as common as inelastic neutrino interactions and may be observed in bubble chambers upon irradiation with neutrino beams. Whenever an electron is observed as a new free particle suddenly moving with kinetic energy, it is inferred to be a result of a neutrino interacting directly with the electron, since this behavior happens more often when the neutrino beam is present. In this process, the neutrino simply strikes the electron and then scatters away from it, transferring some of the neutrino's momentum to the electron. \n\nBecause neutrinos are neither affected by the strong force nor the electromagnetic force, and because the gravitational force between subatomic particles is negligible, such an interaction can only happen via the weak force. Since such an electron is not created from a nucleon, and is unchanged except for the new force impulse imparted by the neutrino, this weak force interaction between the neutrino and the electron must be mediated by an electromagnetically neutral, weak-force boson particle. Thus, this interaction requires a Z boson.\n\nThese bosons are among the heavyweights of the elementary particles. With masses of and , respectively, the W and Z bosons are almost 80 times as massive as the proton – heavier, even, than entire iron atoms. Their high masses limit the range of the weak interaction. By way of contrast, the photon is the force carrier of the electromagnetic force and has zero mass, consistent with the infinite range of electromagnetism; the hypothetical graviton is also expected to have zero mass. (Although gluons are also presumed to have zero mass, the range of the color force is limited for different reasons; \"see color confinement\".)\n\nAll three bosons have particle spin \"s\" = 1. The emission of a or boson either raises or lowers the electric charge of the emitting particle by one unit, and also alters the spin by one unit. At the same time, the emission or absorption of a W boson can change the type of the particle – for example changing a strange quark into an up quark. The neutral Z boson cannot change the electric charge of any particle, nor can it change any other of the so-called \"charges\" (such as strangeness, baryon number, charm, etc.). The emission or absorption of a Z boson can only change the spin, momentum, and energy of the other particle. (See also \"weak neutral current\".)\n\nThe W and Z bosons are carrier particles that mediate the weak nuclear force, much as the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force.\n\nThe W bosons are best known for their role in nuclear decay. Consider, for example, the beta decay of cobalt-60.\n\nThis reaction does not involve the whole cobalt-60 nucleus, but affects only one of its 33 neutrons. The neutron is converted into a proton while also emitting an electron (called a beta particle in this context) and an electron antineutrino:\n\nAgain, the neutron is not an elementary particle but a composite of an up quark and two down quarks (udd). It is in fact one of the down quarks that interacts in beta decay, turning into an up quark to form a proton (uud). At the most fundamental level, then, the weak force changes the flavour of a single quark:\n\nwhich is immediately followed by decay of the itself:\n\nThe Z boson is its own antiparticle. Thus, all of its flavour quantum numbers and charges are zero. The exchange of a Z boson between particles, called a neutral current interaction, therefore leaves the interacting particles unaffected, except for a transfer of momentum. boson interactions involving neutrinos have distinctive signatures: They provide the only known mechanism for elastic scattering of neutrinos in matter; neutrinos are almost as likely to scatter elastically (via Z boson exchange) as inelastically (via W boson exchange). The first prediction of Z bosons was made by Brazilian physicist José Leite Lopes in 1958, by devising an equation which showed the analogy of the weak nuclear interactions with electromagnetism. Steve Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam later used these results to develop the electroweak unification, in 1973. Weak neutral currents via Z boson exchange were confirmed shortly thereafter (also in 1973), in a neutrino experiment in the Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN. \n\nFollowing the spectacular success of quantum electrodynamics in the 1950s, attempts were undertaken to formulate a similar theory of the weak nuclear force. This culminated around 1968 in a unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions by Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam, for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. Their electroweak theory postulated not only the W bosons necessary to explain beta decay, but also a new Z boson that had never been observed.\n\nThe fact that the W and Z bosons have mass while photons are massless was a major obstacle in developing electroweak theory. These particles are accurately described by an SU(2) gauge theory, but the bosons in a gauge theory must be massless. As a case in point, the photon is massless because electromagnetism is described by a U(1) gauge theory. Some mechanism is required to break the SU(2) symmetry, giving mass to the W and Z in the process. The Higgs mechanism, first put forward by the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers, fulfills this role. It requires the existence of another particle the Higgs boson, which since been found at the Large Hadron Collider. Of the four components of a Goldstone boson created by the Higgs field, three are \"eaten\" by the W, Z, and W bosons to form their longitudinal components, and the remainder appears as the spin 0 Higgs boson.\n\nThe combination of the SU(2) gauge theory of the weak interaction, the electromagnetic interaction, and the Higgs mechanism is known as the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model. Today it is widely accepted as one of the pillars of the Standard Model of particle physics, particularly given the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson by the CMS and ATLAS experiments.\n\nThe model predicts that W and Z bosons have the following masses:\n\nwhere g is the SU(2) gauge coupling, g' is U(1) gauge coupling, and v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value.\n\nUnlike beta decay, the observation of neutral current interactions that involve particles requires huge investments in particle accelerators and detectors, such as are available in only a few high-energy physics laboratories in the world (and then only after 1983). This is because Z-bosons behave in somewhat the same manner as photons, but do not become important until the energy of the interaction is comparable with the relatively huge mass of the Z boson.\n\nThe discovery of the W and Z bosons was considered a major success for CERN. First, in 1973, came the observation of neutral current interactions as predicted by electroweak theory. The huge Gargamelle bubble chamber photographed the tracks of a few electrons suddenly starting to move, seemingly of their own accord. This is interpreted as a neutrino interacting with the electron by the exchange of an unseen Z boson. The neutrino is otherwise undetectable, so the only observable effect is the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction.\n\nThe discovery of the W and Z bosons themselves had to wait for the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the Super Proton Synchrotron, where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The actual experiments were called UA1 (led by Rubbia) and UA2 (led by Pierre Darriulat), and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force on the accelerator end (stochastic cooling). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, a most unusual step for the conservative Nobel Foundation.\n\nThe , , and bosons, together with the photon (), comprise the four gauge bosons of the electroweak interaction.\n\nThe W and Z bosons decay to fermion–antifermion pairs but neither the W nor the Z bosons can decay into the higher-mass top quark. Neglecting phase space effects and higher order corrections, simple estimates of their branching fractions can be calculated from the coupling constants.\n\nW bosons can decay to a lepton and neutrino or to an up-type quark and a down-type quark. The decay width of the W boson to a quark–antiquark pair is proportional to the corresponding squared CKM matrix element and the number of quark colours, \"N\" = 3. The decay widths for the W bosons are then proportional to:\n\nHere, , , denote the three flavours of leptons (more exactly, the positive charged antileptons). , , denote the three flavours of neutrinos. The other particles, starting with and , all denote quarks and antiquarks (factor \"N\" is applied). The various \"V\" denote the corresponding CKM matrix coefficients.\n\nUnitarity of the CKM matrix implies that \n\nZ bosons decay into a fermion and its antiparticle. As the Z boson is a mixture of the pre-symmetry-breaking W and B bosons (see weak mixing angle), each vertex factor includes a factor \"T\" − \"Q\" sin\"θ\" where \"T\" is the third component of the weak isospin of the fermion, \"Q \"is the electric charge of the fermion (in units of the elementary charge), and \"θ\" is the weak mixing angle. Because the weak isospin is different for fermions of different chirality, either left-handed or right-handed, the coupling is different as well.\n\nThe relative strengths of each coupling can be estimated by considering that the decay rates include the square of these factors, and all possible diagrams (e.g. sum over quark families, and left and right contributions). This is just an estimate, as we are considering only tree-level diagrams in the Fermi theory.\n\nHere, L and R denote either the left- or right-handed chirality of the fermions, respectively. (The right-handed neutrinos do not exist in the standard model. However, in some extensions beyond the standard model they do.) The notation \"x\" = sin\"θ\" is used.\n\nIn 2018, the CMS collaboration observed the first exclusive decay of the Z boson to a ψ meson and two leptons .\n\n\n"}

The coffee is drunk through the cream. Originally straight cream was used; today whipped cream is most common.\n\nDifferent variations of coffee cocktails pre-date the now-classic Irish coffee by at least 100 years. \n\nFrom the mid 19th century, the \"Pharisäer\" and the \"Fiaker\" were served in Viennese coffee houses; both were coffee cocktails served in glass, topped with whipped cream. The former was also known in northern Germany and Denmark around that time. Around 1900, the coffee cocktail menu in the Viennese cafés also included \"Kaisermelange\", \"Maria Theresia\", \"Biedermeier-Kaffee\" and a handful of other variations on the theme.\n\nIn 19th-century France, a mixture of coffee and spirits was called a \"gloria\".\n\n\nSeveral places claim to have developed the modern recipe in the 1950s. One version is attributed to a Joe Sheridan, head chef at the restaurant and coffee shop in the Foynes Airbase Flying boat terminal building, County Limerick. In 1942 or 1943 he added whiskey to the coffee of some disembarking passengers.\n\nStanton Delaplane, a travel writer for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", maintains he brought Irish coffee to the United States after drinking it at Shannon Airport. His version is that he worked with the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco to start serving it on November 10, 1952., Sheridan later emigrated to work at the Buena Vista Cafe.\n\nIrish whiskey and at least one level teaspoon of sugar are poured over black coffee and stirred in until fully dissolved. Thick cream is carefully poured over the back of a spoon initially held just above the surface of the coffee and gradually raised a little until the entire layer is floated.\n\nIn 1988, the National Standards Authority of Ireland published Irish Standard I.S. 417: Irish Coffee.\n\nAlthough whiskey, coffee and cream are the basic ingredients in all Irish coffee, there are variations in preparation: the choice of coffee and the methods used for brewing it differ significantly. The use of espresso machines or fully automatic coffee brewers is now typical: the coffee is either a caffè americano (espresso diluted with hot water) or some kind of filter coffee, often made using a coffee capsule.\n\nThe cream used in some bars to make what is sold as \"Irish coffee\" is sometimes sprayed from a can. Some bartenders gently shake fresh cream to achieve a smooth layer on top of the coffee.\n\nIn Spain, Irish coffee (\"café irlandés\") is sometimes served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top; special devices are sold for making it.\n\nSome bars in Southeast Asia serve a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey, sometimes without cream, under the name \"Irish coffee\".\n\nMany drinks of hot coffee with a distilled spirit, and cream floated on top—liqueur coffees—are given names derived from Irish coffee, although the names are not standardised. Irish cream coffee (also known as Bailey's coffee) can be considered a variant of Irish coffee, but involves the use of Irish cream as a \"pre-mixed\" substitute for the whisky, cream and sugar. Jamaican coffee would be expected to be made with rum; Highland coffee, also called Gaelic coffee, with Scotch whisky; and so on.\n\n"}

It has a declared alcohol content of 17% by volume.\n\nBaileys Irish Cream was created by Tom Jago of Gilbeys of Ireland, a division of International Distillers & Vintners, as it searched for something to introduce to the international market. The process of finding a product began in 1971 and it was introduced in 1974 as the first Irish cream on the market. The Baileys name was granted permission by John Chesterman after Gilbeys asked to use the name from a restaurant that John Chesterman owned. The fictional \"R.A. Bailey\" signature was inspired by the Bailey's Hotel in London, though the registered trademark omits the apostrophe. Baileys is produced in Dublin and Mallusk (Northern Ireland).\n\nCream and Irish whiskey from various distilleries are homogenized to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier containing refined vegetable oil. The process prevents separation of the alcohol and cream during storage. Baileys contains a proprietary cocoa extract recipe giving Baileys its chocolate character and essence. The quantity of other ingredients is not known but they include herbs and sugar.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, no preservatives are required as the alcohol content preserves the cream. The cream used in the drink comes from Glanbia, an Irish dairy company. Glanbia's Virginia facility in County Cavan produces a range of fat-filled milk powders and fresh cream. It has been the principal cream supplier to Baileys Irish Cream Liqueurs for more than thirty years. At busier times of the year, Glanbia will also supply cream from its Ballyragget facility in Kilkenny.\n\nThe manufacturer claims Baileys Irish Cream has a shelf life of 24 months and guarantees its taste for two years from the day it was made—opened or unopened, stored in a refrigerator or not—when stored away from direct sunlight at temperatures between 0 and 25 °C (32 and 77 °F).\n\nDiageo provides nutritional information for Baileys.\n\nAs is the case with milk, cream will curdle whenever it comes into contact with a weak acid. Milk and cream contain casein, which coagulates, when mixed with weak acids such as lemon, tonic water, or traces of wine. While this outcome is undesirable in most situations, some cocktails (such as the cement mixer, which consists of a shot of Bailey's mixed with the squeezed juice from a slice of lime) specifically encourage coagulation.\n\nIn 2003, Bailey & Co. launched Baileys Glide, aimed at the alcopop market. It was discontinued in 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Baileys launched mint chocolate and crème caramel variants at 17% ABV. They were originally released in UK airports and were subsequently released in the mass markets of the UK, US, Australia and Canada in 2006. In 2008, Baileys, after the success of previous flavour variants, released a coffee variant, followed by a hazelnut flavoured variant in 2010. The company trialled a new premium variety, Baileys Gold, at several European airports in 2009. The Gold version also was marketed towards the Japanese consumer. The latest additions to the Baileys flavour family are Biscotti, launched in 2011, and a sub-brand premium product Baileys Chocolat Luxe, which combined Belgian chocolate with Baileys, in 2013. The company released a Vanilla-Cinnamon variety in the US market in 2013 with further flavours, Pumpkin Spice, Espresso and Salted Caramel launching the following year. In 2017, Baileys launched their Pumpkin Spice flavoured liqueur, also their Vegan Friendly Baileys Almande, and in 2018 Baileys Strawberries & Cream was made available.\n\n\n"}

The cosmopolitan is a relative of cranberry coolers like the Cape Codder. Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a likeness in composition to the kamikaze cocktail.\n\nThe origin of the cosmopolitan is disputed.\n\nWhile the cocktail is widely perceived to be a more modern creation, there is a strikingly similar recipe for a cosmopolitan which appears in \"Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903-1933\", published in 1934.\n\n<poem>\nJigger of Gordon's Gin ( Beefeater)\n2 dash Cointreau ( Cointreau)\nJuice of 1 Lemon ( Lemon Juice)\n1 tsp [.5 cl] Raspberry Syrup (homemade)\n\nShake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.\n</poem>\n\nMade with ingredients that would have been readily available during the period, this identically named cocktail aims for the same effect. If this drink is in fact the source of the modern cosmopolitan, then it would be an adaption of a Daisy rather than a Kamikaze.\n\nOne version of the creation of this popular drink credits the accomplishment to the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts.cosmopolitan\n\nBartender Neal Murray says he created the cosmopolitan in 1975 at the Cork & Cleaver steak house in Minneapolis. According to Murray, he added a splash of cranberry juice to a Kamikaze and the first taster declared, \"How cosmopolitan.\" This event supposedly led to the naming of the new beverage.\n\nJohn Caine is the owner of several popular bars in San Francisco and a cosmopolitan expert. He partially credits the upsurge in cocktails during the 1970s to the Cosmo being served at fern bars. Caine is credited with bringing the Cosmo west from Cleveland.\n\nThere are a number of other claims made as to the origin of the cosmopolitan. Cocktail historian Gary Regan credits bartender Cheryl Cook of the Strand Restaurant in South Beach, Florida with the original creation. Some people think that Cook is a mythical character, but in a letter to Regan, Cook related the story of how she created the drink in 1985 or 1986:\n\nCook's original recipes called for \"Absolut Citron, a splash of Triple sec, a drop of Rose's lime and just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in pink.\" Although Absolut Citron was not introduced anywhere officially until 1988, it was test marketed in Miami.\n\nNotable bartender Gaz Regan says that the internationally recognized version of the cocktail was created by Toby Cecchini in 1987 in Manhattan based on a poorly described version of Cheryl Cook's creation.\n\nCheryl Charming details the story of how in 1989 at The Odeon restaurant, the internationally recognized version of The Cosmopolitan was created by Melissa Huffsmith-Roth.\n\nAccording to Sally Ann Berk and Bob Sennett, the cosmopolitan appears in literature as early as 1993 and derives from New York City.\n\nThe cosmopolitan cocktail gained popularity quickly. It traveled from Provincetown, through New York, Cleveland, and Cincinnati, and on to San Francisco (Caine). It could also possibly have been from Miami to San Francisco, and on to New York (Cook).\n\nThe cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s. It was further popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program \"Sex and the City\", where Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. The film adaptation made a reference to its popularity when Miranda asks why they stopped drinking them, Carrie replies \"because everyone else started.\"\n\nThe cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a \"martini glass\". For this reason, the drink is sometimes mistakenly categorized as a type of martini.\n\nThe use of citrus flavored vodka as the basis for this cocktail appears to have been widely popularized in the mid 1990s by Dale DeGroff and is used in the IBA approved recipe. However, many bartenders continue to use a standard unflavored vodka and this alternative would undoubtedly be historically consistent with any of the supposed predecessors of this drink that were popular in Ohio, Provincetown, or Minneapolis during the 1970s, or in San Francisco during the 1980s. A lemon twist is sometimes used to garnish.\n\n\n"}

Originally called Best Select, and then Pabst Select, the current name comes from the blue ribbons tied around the bottle neck between 1882 and 1916.\n\nGottlieb and Frederika Pabst and their twelve-year-old son Frederick arrived in the United States in 1848 and settled in Chicago where Frederick eventually found work on the ships of Lake Michigan. In 1862, Frederick married Maria Best, daughter of the founder and owner of the Best Brewing Company, and in 1863 became a brewer at his father-in-law's brewery.\n\nWhen Philip Best retired to Germany in 1867, Pabst and Emil Schandein—his sister-in-law's husband and the vice-president of Best Brewery—worked to transform the company into one of the nation's largest brewers, capitalizing on, among other things, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 that destroyed nineteen Chicago breweries and helped position Milwaukee as the leading beer-producing city in the United States. In 1889, Schandein died, leaving Pabst as president and his widow, Lisette Schandein, as vice-president. In 1890, Pabst changed the \"Best\" letterhead to \"Pabst\" and the Pabst Brewing Company officially began.\n\nThe company has historically claimed that its flagship beer was renamed Pabst Blue Ribbon following its win as \"America's Best\" at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Whether the brand actually won an award in 1893 is unclear. Some contemporaneous accounts indicate that many vendors were frustrated by the fair's refusal to award such prizes. One account says that the only prizes awarded by the executive committee were bronze medals, in recognition of \"some independent and essential excellence in the article displayed\", rather than \"merely to indicate the relative merits of competing exhibits\". However, the beer had won many other awards at many other fairs – so many, in fact, that Captain Pabst had already started tying silk ribbons around every bottle. It was a time when beer bottles were more likely to be embossed than labeled and the ribbons were likely added at great cost to Pabst. But Pabst's display of pride was also a display of marketing savvy, as patrons started asking their bartenders for \"the blue-ribbon beer.\"\n\nSales of Pabst peaked at 18 million barrels in 1977. In 1980 and 1981, the company had four different CEOs, and by 1982 it was fifth in beer sales in the U.S., dropping from third in 1980.\n\nIn 1996, Pabst headquarters left Milwaukee, and the company ended beer production at its main complex there. By 2001, the brand's sales were below a million barrels. That year, the company got a new CEO, Brian Kovalchuk, formerly the CFO of Benetton, and major changes at the company's marketing department were made.\n\nIn 2010, food industry executive C. Dean Metropoulos bought the company for a reported $250 million. In 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission forced two advertising executives to cease efforts to raise $300 million to buy the Pabst Brewing Company. The two had raised over $200 million by crowdsourcing, collecting pledges via their website, Facebook, and Twitter. In November 2014, Eugene Kashper, an American beer entrepreneur, and TSG Consumer Partners acquired Pabst Brewing Company.

Although the Pabst website features user-submitted photography, much of which features twenty-something Pabst drinkers dressed in alternative fashions, the company has opted not to fully embrace the countercultural label in its marketing, fearing that doing so could jeopardize the very \"authenticity\" that made the brand popular (as was the case with the poorly received OK Soda). Pabst instead targets its desired market niche through the sponsorship of indie music, local businesses, facial hair clubs (RVA Beard League), post-collegiate sports teams, dive bars and radio programming like National Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\".

The festival is for lunar appreciation and moon watching, when mooncakes are regarded as an indispensable delicacy. Mooncakes are offered between friends or on family gatherings while celebrating the festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the four most important Chinese festivals.\n\nTypical mooncakes are round pastries, measuring about 10 cm in diameter and 3–4 cm thick, and are commonly eaten in the Southern Chinese regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Macau. A rich thick filling usually made from red bean or lotus seed paste is surrounded by a thin (2–3 mm) crust and may contain yolks from salted duck eggs. Mooncakes are usually eaten in small wedges accompanied by tea. Today, it is customary for businessmen and families to present them to their clients or relatives as presents, helping to fuel a demand for high-end mooncakes. \n\nDue to China's influence, mooncakes and Mid-Autumn Festival are also enjoyed and celebrated in other parts of Asia. Mooncakes have also appeared in western countries as a form of delicacy.\n\nMost mooncakes consist of a thick, tender pastry skin enveloping a sweet, dense filling, and may contain one or more whole salted egg yolks in their center as the symbol of the full moon. Very rarely, mooncakes are also served steamed or fried.\n\nTraditional mooncakes have an imprint on top consisting of the Chinese characters for \"longevity\" or \"harmony\", as well as the name of the bakery and the filling inside. Imprints of the moon, Lady Chang'e on the moon, flowers, vines, or a rabbit (symbol of the moon) may surround the characters for additional decoration.\n\nThe festival is intricately linked to legends of Chang E, the mythical Moon Goddess of Immortality.\nAccording to the \"Liji\", an ancient Chinese book recording customs and ceremonies, the Chinese Emperor should offer sacrifices to the sun in spring and the moon in autumn. The 15th day of the 8th lunar month is the day called \"Mid-Autumn\". The night on the 15th of the 8th lunar month is also called \"Night of the Moon\". Under the Song Dynasty (420), the day was officially declared the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nBecause of its central role in the Mid-Autumn festival, mooncakes remained popular even in recent years. For many, they form a central part of the Mid-Autumn festival experience such that it is now commonly known as 'Mooncake Festival'.\n\nThere is a folk tale about the overthrow of Mongol rule facilitated by messages smuggled in moon cakes.\n\nMooncakes were used by the Ming revolutionaries in their effort to overthrow the Mongolian rulers of China at the end of the Yuan dynasty. The idea is said to have been conceived by Zhu Yuanzhang and his advisor Liu Bowen, who circulated a rumor that a deadly plague of \"Hóuzi chuánwěi jíbìng de\" was spreading and that the only way to prevent it was to eat special mooncakes, which would instantly revive and give special powers to the user. This prompted the quick distribution of mooncakes. The mooncakes contained a secret message coordinating the Han Chinese revolt on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month.\n\nAnother method of hiding a message was to print it on the surfaces of mooncakes (which came in packages of four), as a simple puzzle or mosaic. To read the message, each of the four mooncakes was cut into four parts. The resulting 16 pieces were pieced together to reveal the message. The pieces of mooncake were then eaten to destroy the message.\n\nMany types of fillings can be found in traditional mooncakes according to the region's culture:\n\nTraditional mooncakes vary widely depending on the region where they are produced. Most regions produce them with many types of fillings, but with only one type of crust. Although vegetarian mooncakes may use vegetable oil, many mooncakes use lard in their recipes. Three types of mooncake crust are used in Chinese cuisine:\n\nThere are many regional variants of the mooncake. Types of traditional mooncake include:\n\n\n\nOver time, both the crusts and the composition of the fillings of mooncakes have diversified, in particular due to a commercial need to drive up sales in the face of intense competition between producers and from other food types. Part of these trends are also to cater to changing taste preferences, and because people are more health-conscious. Most of these contemporary styles were therefore especially prominent amongst the cosmopolitan and younger Chinese and amongst the overseas Chinese community, although traditional mooncakes are often sold alongside contemporary ones to cater to individual preferences.\n\nSome of the earliest forms of diversification were by changing the fillings with ingredients considered unusual then. Taro paste (芋泥, \"yù ní\"), pineapple and durian were amongst the first to be introduced, especially amongst the overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. The crust itself also evolved, particularly with the introduction of \"snow skin mooncake\". It is different from the traditional mooncake - the snow skin mooncake needs to be stored inside a refrigerator and is white on the outside. Traditionally the colour white means something bad in China, for example, people will wear a white collar to a funeral. However, this kind of white coloured mooncake is popular with teenagers. Miniature mooncakes also appeared, in part to allow for easier individual consumption without the need to cut the large cakes.\n\nTo adapt to today's health-conscious lifestyle, fat-free mooncakes also appeared. Some are made of yogurt, jelly, and fat-free ice-cream. Even high-fiber low-sugar mooncakes have made their appearance. Customers pick and choose the size and filling of mooncakes that suits their taste and diet. For added hygiene, each cake is often wrapped in airtight plastic, accompanied by a tiny food preserver packet.\n\nContemporary-style mooncakes, while increasingly popular, have their detractors. Pricey ingredients have pushed up prices, causing worry of a \"mooncake bubble\" forming in China. Food critics sometimes point out that \"chocolate mooncakes\" are in reality just chocolate shaped into mooncakes, and not mooncakes made of chocolate, while others complain that food chains appear intent on coming up with exotic flavours to take advantage of the market, without much thought for how well the tastes fuse together.\n\nFillings in contemporary style mooncakes has diversified to include just about anything which can be made into a paste. Mooncakes containing taro paste and pineapple, which were considered novelty items at their time of invention have in recent years become commonplace items. In addition, filling with ingredients such as coffee, chocolate, nuts (walnuts, mixed nuts, etc.), fruits (prunes, pineapples, melons, lychees, etc.), vegetables (sweet potatoes, etc.), and even ham have been added to give a modern twist to the traditional recipes. It is also increasingly popular to change the base of the paste to a custard-style.\n\nSome other examples include\nSome bakeries and restaurants have attempted to go up-market, often with excellent results. Gold-plated mooncakes were popular when they first appeared, and it is now possible to even find entire mooncakes made of pure gold. Traditional Chinese delicacies such as ginseng and bird's nest were soon followed by abalone and shark tank. Foreign food companies have also tried to cash in. Häagen-Dazs were one of the first to create an ice-cream mooncake, with a choice of either the \"traditional,\" snow-skin, or Belgian/Swiss white, milk, and dark chocolate crusts. Other ice-cream and restaurant chains soon followed up with their own versions. Other Western ingredients, including champagne ganache, malt whisky, volcanic-salt caramel and even Black truffles, caviar and foie gras have made it into mooncakes.\n\nSnowy mooncakes first appeared on the market in the early 1980s. These non-baked, chilled mooncakes usually come with two types of crusts:\n\nThere are 3 major cities that have diverse types of moon cakes. Georgetown, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah. Mooncakes are quite similar to the traditional Chinese. However, many prefer to add 100% pure Hunan lotus seed to maintain the quality of mooncake. The most popular types, especially in Kuala Lumpur, are White Lotus Seed Paste Cake, Snow Skins and Black Sesame With Yolk.\n\nIn Indonesia, there several main types of mooncakes, from the traditional to the modern mooncakes. The very traditional mooncake has been there ever since the Chinese and Japanese entered Indonesia, they are circular like a moon, white and thinner than regular mooncake. Fillings may include pork, chocolate, cheese, milk, durian, jackfruit and many other exotic fruits made into a paste. This type of mooncake is widely available all year long while the regular modern mooncakes are usually only sold around the mid-autumn festival season. The \"modern\" mooncakes entered Indonesia after 1998.\n\nMooncakes in Japan are known as , a direct translation of the Chinese name. They are associated with Chinese culture and are sold all year round, mainly in Japan's Chinatowns. Azuki (red bean) paste is the most popular filling for these mooncakes, but other sorts of beans as well as chestnut are also used. Unlike some types of Chinese mooncakes, mooncakes in Japan almost never contain an egg yolk in the center.\n\nIn Vietnam, mooncakes are known as Bánh Trung Thu (literally \"Mid-Autumn cake\"). Vietnamese mooncakes are usually sold in either individually or in a set of four . There are two kinds of mooncake: \"Bánh nướng\" (baked mooncake) and \"Bánh dẻo\" (sticky rice mooncake).\n\nIt can be said that \"Bánh nướng\" and \"Bánh dẻo\" are two special kinds of cake in Vietnam. They are widely popular and are sold only during the Mid-Autumn Festival season. Vietnamese Mooncakes are often in the shape of a circle (10 cm in diameter) or a square (a length of about 7–8 cm), and 4–5 cm thick. Larger sizes are not uncommon. Their designs largely resemble that of their Chinese counterpart, though some other images, such as the sow with cub, fish, shrimp, etc. can also be found.\n\nVietnamese mooncakes have two basic parts: crust and filling. The ingredients usually consist of: jam, dried sausage, mung bean paste, salt, sugar, cooking oil, sugared lard, lotus seed, watermelon seed, etc. Compared to other variants, Vietnamese mooncakes' flavor is more on the sweet side. Thus, to balance it, salted egg yolk is often added. They can be baked or eaten immediately.\n\n\"Bánh nướng\" (Baked mooncake) is made from wheat flour, cooking oil, and simple syrup boiled with malt. After being filled with various combinations of salted egg yolk, dried sausage, mung bean paste, salt, sugar, cooking oil, sugared pig fat, lotus seed, watermelon seed, it will be brushed with egg wash, then baked in the oven. The egg wash will protect the crust of the cake from drying out and create the aroma of the cake. The cakes have to be rotated constantly in the oven to prevent burning.\n\n\"Bánh dẻo\" (Sticky rice mooncake) is easier to make than \"Bánh nướng\". The crust and filling are pre-cooked. The crust is made from roasted glutinous rice flour, pomelo blossom water or vanilla and simple syrup. After malaxating rice flour, fillings similar to that of baked mooncake is stuffed inside the crust and then the cake is put into the mold dusted with a thin layer of flour to prevent sticking to fingers. The cake can be used immediately without any further steps. \"Bánh dẻo\" is not as popular as \"Bánh nướng\", however.\n\n\nIn Thailand, mooncakes (in Thai, ขนมไหว้พระจันทร์) are sold in Thai-Chinese bakeries during festival season. In Bangkok, traditional and modern moon cakes are not limited to Chinatown on Yaowarat Road, but they are also found in stalls of large supermarkets. Durian-filled mooncakes are ones of the most popular sold, especially with one or two salted egg yolks.\n\nIn Singapore, mooncakes comes in all kinds of flavours ranging from the traditional baked ones to the Teochew flaky ones to the soft snowskin. The base fillings are usually lotus paste, white lotus paste or red bean paste. There are also a variety of other ingredients like double or single salted duck egg yolks, macadamia nuts, osmantus, orange and melon seeds. It has become a habit to give away mooncakes in beautiful boxes as corporate gifts or to parents.\n\nMaxim Group (MX) and Wing Wah are the best known producers of mooncakes, with Maxim being the top-selling brand in Hong Kong for 19 consecutive years. Maxim has been known for its lava custard mooncakes which were extremely popular in mainland China, as well as its July sell-out sales of coupons (each coupon redeemable for a box of mooncake in August-September).\n\nIn recent years there has been criticism of the high calorie content of mooncakes, for instance a typical lotus seed paste mooncake with two salted egg yolks has 890 calories. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "413472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413472", "title": "Idli", "text": "Idli\n\nIdli or idly () () are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in southern India and northern Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body.\n\nIdli have several variations, including rava idli, which are made from semolina. Regional variants include \"sanna\" of Konkan and Enduri Pitha of Odisha.\n\nA precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. \"Vaddaradhane\", a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya mentions \"iddalige\", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopaedia, \"Lokopakara\" (c. 1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices. The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, \"Manasollasa\" (1130 CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes the food as \"iḍḍarikā\". The food prepared using this recipe is now called \"uddina idli\" in Karnataka.\n\nThe recipe mentioned in these ancient Indian works leaves out three key aspects of the modern idli recipe: the use of rice (not just urad dal), the long fermentation of the mix, and the steaming for fluffiness. The references to the modern recipe appear in the Indian works only after 1250 CE. Food historian K. T. Achaya speculates that the modern idli recipe might have originated in present-day Indonesia, which has a long tradition of fermented food. According to him, the cooks employed by the Hindu kings of the Indianised kingdoms might have invented the steamed idli there, and brought the recipe back to India during 800-1200 CE. Achaya mentioned an Indonesian dish called \"kedli\", which according to him, was like an idli. However, Janaki Lenin was unable to find any recipe for an Indonesian dish by this name.\n\nThe Gujarati work \"Varṇaka Samuccaya\" (1520 CE) mentions idli as \"idari\", and also mentions its local adaption \"idada\" (a non-fermented version of dhokla). The earliest extant Tamil work to mention idli (as \"itali\") is \"Maccapuranam\", dated to the 17th century.\n\nIn 2015, Chennai-based Idli caterer Eniyavan started celebrating March 30 as the \"World Idli Day\".\n\nTo make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (Idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (urad dal, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight. Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour. Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or \"tree\" for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10–25 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.\n\nSince plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with sambar but this varies greatly by region and personal taste. Idlis are also frequently served with chutnies (coconut based), kaara chutney (onion based) or Spicy Fish Curries. The dry spice mixture podi is convenient while travelling.\n\nWith the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations. Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods. Parboiled rice can reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used. Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli). Dahi (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavor for unfermented batters. Prepackaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.\n\nIn addition to or instead of fenugreek other spices may be used such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savory. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of potato, beans, carrot and masala. Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and sautéed for a dish called idli upma. You can even prepare dahi idli by combining curd and idli together and then tempering the dish. Rather than a stovetop steamer, microwave and automatic electric idli steamers are available with convenient non-stick coating. Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders or blenders (mixies). Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of Idlis as idly manchurian, idly fry, chilly idly and a lot of different ideas.\n\nThis popular South Indian breakfast dish is known for the countless health benefits. This light and soft rice cake can be had with red, green or white coconut chutney. It may also be accompanied with chutney powder. Unconventional chefs have come up with Green Moong Dal Idlis, a modern twist on the traditional Idli recipe.\n\nFermentation of idli batter results in both leavening caused by the generation of carbon dioxide as well as an increase in acidity. This fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria especially the heterofermantative strain \"Leuconostoc mesenteroides\" and the homofermantative strain \"Enterococcus faecalis\" (formerly classified as \"Streptococcus faecalis\"). Heterofermantative lactic acid bacteria such as \"L. mesenteroides\" generate both lactic acid as well as carbon dioxide whereas homofermantative lactic acid bacteria only generate lactic acid.\n\nBoth \"L. mesenteroides\" and \"E. faecalis\" are predominantly delivered to the batter by the urad dal. Both strains start multiplying while the grains are soaking and continue to do so after grinding.\n\n\"L. mesenteroides\" tolerates high concentrations of salt unlike most other bacteria. Hence the salt in the batter and the ongoing generation of lactic acid both suppress the growth of other undesirable micro-organisms.\n\n"}

Kikkoman is the most popular brand of soy sauce in Japan and the United States. The village of Sappemeer in Groningen, the Netherlands, is the European headquarters of the company. A plant on the site began operations in 1997 and now produces over 400 million litres of soy sauce per annum.\n\nFounded in 1917, it is based in Noda, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. It is a combination of 8 family-owned businesses founded as early as 1603 by the Mogi and Takanashi families.\n\n\"Kikko\", which means tortoise shell in Japanese, and \"man\", meaning 10,000, were chosen first as the trademark and later as the company name. This was to symbolize longevity, as according to Japanese folklore a tortoise lives for 10,000 years. This symbolism is found in Kikkoman's logo, which is a rebus that consists of the Chinese character for 10,000 (萬 wàn) surrounded by a hexagon, representing a tortoise shell; see Japanese rebus monogram for more examples.\n\nKikkoman soy sauce is naturally brewed (see Soy Sauce, Traditional Production). After soaking in water for an extended period, soy beans are steamed at high temperature before they are mixed with crushed roasted wheat. Salt is added, which acts as an anti-bacterial agent and preservative. Next, a genus of the \"Aspergillus\" fungus is added to the mixture and left for three days to create \"shōyu koji\", the base for the soy sauce. This base is then transferred to a tank and mixed with a saline solution, which creates a mash known as \"moromi\". Several months of aging follow, when various organic processes occur including lactic acid, alcoholic and organic acid fermentation take place to create unique flavours. The \"moromi\" is then mechanically pressed through layers of fabric for around ten hours to extract the raw product. In the last part of the process, the raw soy sauce is left to separate for 3–4 days, then pasteurised using steam, which also stops any enzymic activity. The final product is then ready for inspection and bottling. Kikkoman has a distinctive bottle for its soy sauce, designed by Kenji Ekuan in 1961.\n\nKikkoman also makes teriyaki sauce, which was introduced in 1968.\n\n\n"}

A similar term is \"securocrat\".\n\nThe term \"silovik\", literally translated as \"person of force\" (from Russian \"сила\", \"force\"), originated with the phrase \"institutions of force\" (), which appeared in the earlier Boris Yeltsin era (early 1990s) to denote the military-style uniformed services, including the military proper, the police (Ministry of Interior), national security (FSB) organisations and some other structures.\n\nSiloviki wish to encourage a view that they might be seen in Russia as being generally non-ideological, with a pragmatic law-and-order focus and Russian national interests at heart. They are generally well-educated and bring past commercial experience to their government posts. It is assumed that the siloviki have a natural preference for the reemergence of a strong Russian state. \n\nThe siloviki do not form a cohesive group. They do not have a single leader and there is no common, articulated \"silovik agenda\". However, according to John P. Willerton, these security-intelligence officials brought the work ethic and skills – that Putin apparently favoured – to the administration.\n\n\nSenior siloviki under Putin's presidency included Sergei Ivanov, Viktor Ivanov and Sergey Shoygu, who had close working relationships with Putin and held key positions in Putin's governments. Willerton points out, however, that it is difficult to assess if their common security-intelligence background translates into common political preferences.\n\nFollowing the 2011 Russian protests, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, having made promises of political reform, nevertheless appointed several siloviki to prominent positions in the government: Sergei Ivanov to chief of staff of the presidential administration; Dmitry Rogozin to deputy prime minister; and Vyacheslav Volodin to deputy chief of staff.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "415478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415478", "title": "Jab", "text": "Jab\n\nA jab is a type of punch used in the martial arts. Several variations of the jab exist, but every jab shares these characteristics: while in a fighting stance, the lead fist is thrown straight ahead and the arm is fully extended from the side of the torso. This process also involves a quick turn of the torso. It is an overhand punch; at the moment of impact, the pronated fist is generally held in a horizontal orientation with the palm facing the ground.\n\nThe word jab was first used in 1825, to mean \"to thrust with a point.\" The term is a Scottish variant of the word \"job\", which means \"to strike, pierce, thrust.\"\n\nA jab is an integral part of a fighter's defense. Its speed and power of execution and reach can keep the opponent at a distance, preventing him from charging in. Defensive jabs can be employed while moving backwards.\n\nThis jab gives a fighter high mobility and is often used with the intention of scoring points. Fighters use this variation of the jab when they want to preserve the mobility and balance of their stance.\n\nUsed in order to establish a feeling for distance, the rangefinding jab is often used to set up a power punch with the other hand. Thus it can help conserve stamina and lower the risk of being countered by allowing the fighter to commit his stronger hand only when he is within proper range.\n\nBoxers have been wobbled by a rangefinding jab.\n\nPower can be added to a jab if it is thrown with a moderate step forward. The drawback to this technique is that it takes the fighter out of his boxing stance, committing him to the punch rather more than the speed jab. A \"pivot jab\" is the most powerful jab, one in which the weight shifts almost entirely to the lead foot, which pivots to put the mass of the body behind the punch. Jabbing from the hip, rather than from a tight guard, will add power to the jab at the expense of speed.\n\nJabbing to the body is relatively uncommon, because it increases a fighter's vulnerability to a counterpunch. Typically, the fighter bends at the waist and fires a speed jab to the midsection of his opponent in an attempt at getting the opponent to drop his guard. It is impractical to put the body weight behind this punch, so power is limited. The jab to the body can be used effectively to counter the opponents lead jab.\n\n\nHistorians consider some of the best \"jabbers\" in history to be Sonny Liston, Larry Holmes, Muhammad Ali, Hector Camacho, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Recent master jabbers include Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko, both coached by the same trainer and able to develop significant power into their jabs.\nHolmes' jab has often been called \"the best among Heavyweights\", Ali's jab was famous for its speed and Liston's for its power. Mike Tyson used a rare version of a slip jab, that allowed him to jab effectively against taller opponents with longer reach.\n\n"}

It is usually a combination of one part tomato ketchup and two parts mayonnaise, with many variations which add additional ingredients to the basic recipe.\n\nAlthough sauce composed of a mixture of equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise appears in a New Orleans cookbook published in 1900, fry sauce was originally popularized in the United States by a chef named Don Carlos Edwards, who served it in his first restaurant, Don Carlos’ Barbecue in Salt Lake City, which eventually became the Utah-based restaurant chain Arctic Circle in the 1950s.

A number of Twitter users responded that such a mixture already existed as \"fry sauce\" and \"fancy sauce\". The sauce arrived at U.S. retailers' shelves in September 2018.\n\nIn May 2018, Fancy Sauce announced plans to release its \"fancy sauce\" condiment, a take on the traditional ketchup, mayo blend without actually combining ketchup and mayo.\n\nIn Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, a similar condiment known as \"\" (golf sauce) is a popular dressing for fries, burgers, steak sandwiches, and seafood salads.

{"id": "419013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419013", "title": "Kirk", "text": "Kirk\n\nKirk is a Scottish and Northern English word meaning \"church\", or more specifically, the Church of Scotland. Many place names and personal names are derived from it.\n\nAs a common noun, \"kirk\" (meaning 'church') is found in Scots, Scottish English, Ulster-Scots and some English dialects, attested as a noun from the 14th century onwards, but as an element in placenames much earlier. Both words, \"kirk\" and \"church\", derive from the Koine Greek κυριακόν (δωμα) (kyriakon (dōma)) meaning \"Lord's (house)\", which was borrowed into the Germanic languages in late antiquity, possibly in the course of the Gothic missions. (Only a connection with the idiosyncrasies of Gothic explains how a Greek neuter noun became a Germanic feminine.) Whereas \"church\" displays Old English palatalisation, \"kirk\" is a loanword from Old Norse and thus has the original mainland Germanic consonants. Compare cognates: Icelandic & Faroese \"kirkja\"; Swedish \"kyrka\"; Norwegian (Nynorsk) \"kyrkje\"; Norwegian (Bokmål) & Danish \"kirke\"; German \"Kirche\" (reflecting palatalization before unstressed front vowel); Dutch \"kerk\"; West Frisian \"tsjerke\"; and borrowed into non-Germanic languages: Estonian \"kirik\" and Finnish \"kirkko\".\n\nAs a proper noun, \"The Kirk\" is an informal name for the Church of Scotland, the country's national church. \"The Kirk of Scotland\" was in official use as the name of the Church of Scotland until the 17th century, and still today the term is frequently used in the press and everyday speech, though seldom in the Church's own literature. However, Kirk Session is still the standard term in church law for the court of elders in the local congregation, both in the Church of Scotland and in any of the other Scottish Presbyterian denominations.\n\nEven more commonly, \"The Free Kirk\" is heard as an informal name for the Free Church of Scotland, the remnant of an evangelical presbyterian church formed in 1843 when its founders withdrew from the Church of Scotland. See:\n\n\n\"High Kirk\" is the term sometimes used to describe a congregation of the Church of Scotland which uses a building which was a cathedral prior to the Reformation. As the Church of Scotland is not governed by bishops, it has no cathedrals in the episcopal sense of the word. In more recent times, the traditional names have been revived, so that in many cases both forms can be heard: Glasgow Cathedral, as well as the \"High Kirk of Glasgow\", and St. Giles' Cathedral, as well as the \"High Kirk of Edinburgh\".\nThe term High Kirk should, however, be used with some caution. Several towns have a congregation known as the High Kirk which were never pre-Reformation cathedrals. Examples include:\n\nThere is no connection between the term 'High Kirk' and the term 'High Church', which is a type of Churchmanship within the Anglican Communion.\n\nThe first court of Presbyterian polity where the Elders of a particular congregation gather as a Session or meeting to govern the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church.\n\nThe verb \"to kirk\", meaning 'to present in church', was probably first used for the annual church services of some Scottish town councils, known as the Kirking of the Council. Since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the Kirking of the Parliament has become a fixed ceremony at the beginning of a session.\nHistorically a newly married couple would attend public worship as man and wife for the first time at their Kirking.\nIn Nova Scotia, Kirking of the Tartan ceremonies have become an integral part of most Scottish Festivals and Highland Games.\n\nLike words meaning \"church\" in other languages, \"kirk\" is found as an element in many placenames in Scotland and England, and in countries with large British expatriate communities. Examples include Falkirk, Kirkwall or numerous Kirkhills in Scotland, and Kirkstall, Ormskirk, Kirkby, Kirklees, and so forth in England, and Newkirk, Oklahoma in the United States.\nWhat may be slightly surprising is that this element is found not only in place names of Anglo-Saxon origin, but also in some Southern Scottish names of Gaelic origin such as Kirkcudbright (where the second element is the \"Gaelic\" form of the English name Cuthbert). Here, the Gaelic element \"cil-\" (church, monk's cell) might be expected. The reason appears to be that \"kirk\" was borrowed into Galwegian Gaelic, though it was never part of Gaelic as it was spoken in the Highlands or Ireland.\n\nWhen the element appears in placenames in the former British empire, a distinction can be made between those where the element is productive (the place is named because of the presence of a church) and those where it is merely transferred (the place is named after a place in Britain). Kirkland, Washington is an exception, being named after English settler Peter Kirk.\n\nThe element \"kirk\" is also used in anglicisations of continental European place names originally formed from one of the continental Germanic cognates.

It is a type of crisp, sweetened bread, made with eggs and baked twice. It originated in East Prussia. The Mennonites brought \"Zwieback\" to the Russian Empire; before the Russian Revolution, when many emigrated to the west, they brought \"Zwieback\" to Canada, the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nThere are two types of zwieback. One type is made by pinching round pieces of dough, placing one piece on top of another, pressing them together by pushing a finger down through both pieces. It is then baked and served as warm soft rolls. This type is identified with Mennonites.\nThe other type is a bread sliced before it is baked a second time, which produces crisp, brittle slices that closely resemble melba toast. \"Zwieback\" is commonly used to feed teething children and as the first solid food for patients with an upset stomach.\n\nThe name comes from German \"zwei\" (\"two\") or \"zwie\" (\"twi-\"), and \"backen\", meaning \"to bake\". \"Zwieback\" hence literally translates to \"twice-baked\". The French and Italian names, respectively, \"biscotte\" and \"fette biscottate\" have the same origin, \"biscotto\" (biscuit), which also means twice (\"bis-\") baked (-\"cotto\").\n\nSlovene name is \"prepečenec\" which would imply baked over ordinary or overbaked.

It is frequently consumed as a traditional Christmas dessert in Italy and Spain as well as countries formerly under the Spanish Empire, particularly in Latin America.\n\nThis nougat confection is known by similar names in different languages. In Spanish it is ). In Catalan, (). In Italian, (). In Brazilian Portuguese (). In Sardinian (). In European Portuguese, (). In Tagalog, (.\n\nThe 16th-century \"Manual de Mujeres\" (Women's handbook), a handbook of recipes for cosmetics and some foodstuffs, has what is probably the oldest extant Spanish turrón recipe. It calls for honey and some egg whites, cooked until it becomes breakable once cooled. Once the honey is caramelized the recipe suggests adding pine nuts, almonds or hazelnuts, peeled and roasted. The mix is then cooked a bit further, and finally removed from the heat and cut into slices.\n\nAll versions of the name appear to have been derived from Latin \"torrere\" (to toast). The modern confection might be derived from the Muslim recipe prevalent in parts of Islamic Spain known as \"turun\". One may also point to a similar confection named \"cupedia\" or \"cupeto\" that was marketed in Ancient Rome and noted by Roman poets.\n\nTurrón or \"Torró\" has been known at least since the 15th century in the city of Jijona/Xixona (formerly Sexona), north of Alicante. Turrón is commonly consumed in most of Spain, some countries of Latin America, and in Roussillon (France). The similar \"Torrone\" is typical of Cremona and Benevento in Italy. There are similar confections made in the Philippines.\n\nVariations are found in several regions of the northern Mediterranean.\n\nTurrón itself can take on a variety of consistencies and appearances, however they traditionally consisted of the same ingredients; the final product may be either hard and crunchy, or soft and chewy. Thirty years ago almost all turrón recipes followed the same specifications, but since the diversification of products there are currently dozens of varieties: chocolate with puffed rice or whole almonds; all kinds of chocolate pralines, with or without liquor, candied fruits or whole nuts; fruit pralines; and even sugarless variations (sweetened with fructose or artificial sweeteners).\n\nTraditional Spanish turrón may be classified as:\n\nThis variation in ingredients and resulting dryness reflects a continuum that exists also in amaretto (almond flavored) cookies, from a meringue to a macaroon.\n\nOther varieties include \"Torró d'Agramunt\" from near Lleida, \"Torró de Xerta\" from near Tortosa and \"torró de Casinos\".\n\nModernly the name \"turrón\" has widened its meaning in Spain to include many other sweet preparations that have in common with traditional turrón being sold in bars of around 20 x 10 x 3 cm. These bars can feature chocolate, marzipan, coconut, caramel, candied fruit, etc.\n\nTorrone is a traditional winter and Christmas confection in Italy and many varieties exist. They differ from the Spanish version in that a lower proportion of nuts is used in the confection. Traditional versions from Cremona, Lombardy, range widely in texture (\"morbido\", soft and chewy, to \"duro\", hard and brittle) and in flavor (with various citrus flavorings, vanilla, etc., added to the nougat) and may contain whole hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios or only have nut meal added to the nougat. Some commercial versions are dipped in chocolate. The popular recipes have varied with time and differ from one region to the next. \"Torrone di Benevento\" from Benevento, Campania, sometimes goes by the historic name \"Cupedia\", which signifies the crumbly version made with hazelnuts. The softer version is made with almonds. The \"Torrone di Benevento\" is considered to be the oldest of its kind since it predates Roman times and was widely known in the territories of Samnium Although originally resembling sticky paste, it now differs only marginally from the varieties of \"Torrone di Cremona\". Abruzzo, Sicily and Sardinia also have local versions that may be slightly distinct from the two main denominations from Lombardy and Campania.\nThe awarded quality is an ancient recipe documented just since 1700.\nIt is produced with orange blossom honey(origin Calabria-Sicily), Almond (origin Sicily),Egg-white, Sugar, Cocoa and essential oil.\nIt can be distinguished in two different variation.\nFirst is known as \"Martiniana\" lightly wrapped by sugar grain. \nOther is known as \"Torrefatto\" when it is glazed of cocoa.\n\nIn Peruvian cuisine turrón generally is soft and may be flavored with anise. The original Spanish recipe, which contained ingredients that were rare or expensive in Peru (such as almonds, rose water, orange blossom water, honey), was modified in a variety of ways. One common variety found in Lima is Turrón de Doña Pepa, an anise and honey nougat that is traditionally prepared for the Señor de los Milagros (or Lord of Miracles) religious procession, during October.\n\nCashew turrón (Philippine Spanish: \"turrones de casúy\"; Spanish: \"turrones de anacardo\") from Pampanga Province is a derivative. It is a bar of marzipan made with cashew nuts, and wrapped in a white wafer. Unlike in the rest of Hispanidad, this candy is not associated with the holiday season. Another derivative is the \"turrones de pili\", made using the native pili nut.\n\nAn unrelated yet similarly-named street food is \"turón na saging\", which are sliced banana or plantain dipped in brown sugar, wrapped in spring roll wrappers, and deep-fried.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, turrón is called \"Turrón de Ajónjolí\" (sesame turrón). Puerto Rican turrón is made with toasted black and white sesame seeds, ground cinnamon, lemon juice, bound together by caramelized brown sugar and honey. Other varieties include almonds, lime zest, sunflower seeds with flax seeds, orange zest, and toasted coconut flakes.\n\nIn Cuba, \"turrón de maní\" (peanut nougat) is a traditional sweet treat. Snack-sized bars are usually peddled across bus stops and crowds, though family loaves of up to two pounds are also available. They run in two variants: \"blando\", ground peanuts pressed into bars with brown sugar; and \"duro\", coarsely chopped roasted peanuts bound together with caramelized sugar and honey.\n\nVarious types of Turrón/Torrone that have protected geographical status under EU law include:\n\nOthers, such as Torrone di Cremona (Italy) have protected status by (but not limited to) the country that produces it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "425059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425059", "title": "Ranch dressing", "text": "Ranch dressing\n\nRanch dressing is a type of salad dressing made of some combination of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs (commonly chives, parsley, and dill), and spices (commonly black pepper, paprika, and ground mustard seed), mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise, or another oil emulsion. Sour cream and yogurt are sometimes used in addition to or as a substitute for buttermilk and mayonnaise. Ranch dressing has been the best-selling salad dressing in the United States since 1992, when it overtook Italian dressing. It is also popular in the US as a dip and flavoring for chips and other foods. In 2017, forty percent of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Steve Henson developed what is now known as ranch dressing while working as a plumbing contractor for three years in the remote Alaskan bush. In 1954, he and his wife Gayle opened Hidden Valley Ranch, a dude ranch at the former Sweetwater Ranch on San Marcos Pass in Santa Barbara County, California, where they served it to customers. It became popular, and they began selling it in packages for customers to take home, both as a finished product and as packets of seasoning to be mixed with mayonnaise and buttermilk. As demand grew, they incorporated Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc., and opened a factory to manufacture it in larger volumes, which they first distributed to supermarkets in the Southwest, and eventually, nationwide. In October 1972, the Hidden Valley Ranch brand was bought by Clorox for $8 million.\n\nKraft Foods and General Foods responded with similar dry seasoning packets labeled as \"ranch style\". As a result, they were both sued for trademark infringement by the Waples-Platter Companies, the Texas-based manufacturer of Ranch Style Beans (now part of ConAgra Foods), even though Waples-Platter had declined to enter the salad dressing market itself out of fear that the tendency of such products to spoil rapidly would damage its brand. The case was tried before federal judge Eldon Brooks Mahon in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1976. Judge Mahon ruled in favor of Waples-Platter in a lengthy opinion which described the various \"ranch style\" and \"ranch\" products then available, of which many had been created to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch. Judge Mahon specifically noted that Hidden Valley Ranch and Waples-Platter had no dispute with each other (though he also noted that Hidden Valley Ranch was simultaneously suing General Foods in a separate federal case in California). The only issue before the Texas federal district court was that Waples-Platter was disputing the right of other manufacturers to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch by using the label \"ranch style\".\n\nMeanwhile, Clorox reformulated the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing several times to make it more convenient for consumers. The first change was to include buttermilk flavoring in the seasoning, meaning much less expensive regular milk could be used to mix the dressing instead. In 1983, Clorox developed a more popular non-refrigerated bottled formulation. As of 2002, Clorox subsidiary Hidden Valley Ranch Manufacturing LLC produces ranch packets and bottled dressings at two large factories, in Reno, Nevada, and Wheeling, Illinois.\n\nDuring the 1980s, ranch became a common snack food flavor, starting with Cool Ranch Doritos in 1987, and Hidden Valley Ranch Wavy Lay's in 1994.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Hidden Valley had three kid-oriented variations of ranch dressing: pizza, nacho cheese, and taco flavors.\n\nRanch dressing is common in the United States as a dipping sauce for broccoli, carrots and celery as well as a dip for chips and \"bar foods\" such as french fries and chicken wings. It is also a common dipping sauce for fried foods such as fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, chicken fingers, and hushpuppies. In addition, ranch dressing is used on pizza, pickles, baked potatoes, wraps, tacos, pretzels, and hamburgers.\n\nIn Germany, Kühne produces a product labeled as Würziges Ranch-Dressing (literally \"spicy ranch dressing\"). It is based on the common recipe but contains additional tomatoes, red bell peppers, and red pepper. Its color is not white but looks like cocktail sauce.\n\nRanch dressing is produced by many manufacturers, including Hidden Valley, Ken's, Kraft, Litehouse, Marie's, Newman's Own, and Wish-Bone.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, at a campaign event for her 2020 presidential bid, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N. Y.) was briefly interrupted by a woman looking for ranch dressing. The event went viral on the internet, and the woman was later identified as Hanna Kinne, a student from the University of Iowa. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "425104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425104", "title": "Salsa (sauce)", "text": "Salsa (sauce)\n\nSalsa is any one of several sauces typical of Mexican cuisine, also known as salsa fresca, hot salsa or salsa picante, particularly those used as dips. Salsa is often tomato-based, and includes ingredients such as onions, chilies, an acid and herbs. It is typically piquant, ranging from mild to extremely hot. Though many different sauce preparations are called \"salsa\" in Spanish, in English, it generally refers to raw or near-raw sauces used as dips.\n\nThe word \"salsa\" entered the English language from the Spanish \"salsa\" (\"sauce\"), which itself derives from the Latin \"salsus\" (salted). The native Spanish pronunciation is . In American English it is pronounced , while in British English it is pronounced as .\n\nMexican salsas were traditionally produced using the mortar and pestle-like \"molcajete\", although blenders are now more commonly used. The Maya made salsa also, using a mortar and pestle. Well-known \"salsas\" include:\nThere are many other salsas, both traditional and \"nouveau\", some are made with mint, pineapple, or mango.\n\nOutside Mexico and Central America, the following salsas are common to each of the following regions; in Argentina and the Southern Cone, chimichurri sauce is common. Chimichurri is \"a spicy vinegar-parsley sauce that is the salsa (and leading condiment) in Argentina and Uruguay, served with grilled meat. It is made of chopped fresh parsley and onion, seasoned with garlic, oregano, salt, cayenne chilies and black pepper and bound with oil and vinegar.\" In Costa Rica, dishes are prepared with salsa Lizano, a thin, smooth, light brown sauce. In Cuba and the Caribbean, a typical salsa is \"mojo\". Unlike the tomato-based salsas, \"mojo\" typically consists of olive oil, garlic, and citrus juice, and is used both to marinate meats and as a dipping sauce. In Peru, a traditional salsa is \"peri peri\" or \"piri piri\" sauce: \"The national condiment of Peru, \"peri-peri\" sauce is made in medium to hot levels of spiciness—the more chili, or the hotter variety of chile used, the hotter the sauce. Original \"peri-peri\" uses the African bird’s eye chili (the Swahili word for the chili is \"peri-peri\"). Milder sauces may use only cayenne and serrano chilies. To a base of vinegar and oil, garlic and lemon juice are added, plus other seasonings, which often include paprika or tomato paste for flavor and color, onions and herb—each company has its own recipe. It is also used as a cooking sauce.\"\n\nMost jarred, canned, and bottled salsa and picante sauces sold in the United States in grocery stores are forms of \"salsa cruda\" or \"pico de gallo\", and typically have a semi-liquid texture. To increase their shelf lives, these salsas have been cooked to a temperature of , and are thus not truly \"cruda\" (raw). Some have added vinegar, and some use pickled peppers instead of fresh ones. Tomatoes are strongly acidic by nature, which, along with the heat processing, is enough to stabilize the product for grocery distribution.\n\n\"Picante\" sauce of the American type is often thinner in consistency than what is labelled as \"salsa\". \"Picante\" is a Spanish adjective meaning \"piquant\", which derives from \"picar\" (\"to sting\"), referring to the feeling caused by salsas on one's tongue.\n\nMany grocery stores in the United States and Canada also sell fresh refrigerated salsa, usually in plastic containers. Fresh salsa is usually more expensive and has a shorter shelf life than canned or jarred salsa. It may or may not contain vinegar.\n\nTaco sauce is a condiment sold in American grocery stores and fast food Tex-Mex outlets. Taco sauce is similar to its Mexican counterpart in that it is smoothly blended, having the consistency of thin ketchup. It is made from tomato paste instead of whole tomatoes and lacks the seeds and chunks of vegetables found in picante sauce.\n\nWhile some salsa fans do not consider jarred products to be real \"salsa cruda\", their widespread availability and long shelf life have been credited with much of salsa's enormous popularity in states outside the southwest, especially in areas where salsa is not a traditional part of the cuisine. In 1992, the dollar value of salsa sales in the United States exceeded those of tomato ketchup.\n\nThe World Health Organization says care should be taken in the preparation and storage of salsas and any other types of sauces, since many raw-served varieties can act as growth media for potentially dangerous bacteria, especially when unrefrigerated.\n\nIn 2002 a study by the University of Texas–Houston, found sauces contaminated with \"E. coli\" in:\n\nIn 2010 the CDC reported that 1 in 25 foodborne illnesses between 1998 and 2008 was traced back to restaurant sauces (carelessly prepared or stored).\n\nA 2010 paper on salsa food hygiene described refrigeration as \"the key to safe\" sauces. This study also found that fresh lime juice and fresh garlic (but not powdered garlic) would prevent the growth of bacteria.\n\n\n"}

Other fish can be used instead of haddock such as tuna or salmon, though that is not traditional.\n\nIn India, khichari (among other English spellings) usually refers to any of a large variety of legume-and-rice dishes. These dishes are made with a spice mixture designed for each recipe and either dry-toasted or fried in oil before inclusion. This dish moved to Victorian Britain and changed dramatically to the recipe described above.\n\nKedgeree is thought to have originated with the Indian rice-and-bean or rice-and-lentil dish khichri, traced back to 1340 or earlier. It is widely believed that the dish was brought to the United Kingdom by returning British colonials who had enjoyed it in India and introduced it to the UK as a breakfast dish in Victorian times, part of the then fashionable Anglo-Indian cuisine.\n\nThe dish was listed as early as 1790 in the recipe book of Stephana Malcolm of Burnfoot, Dumfriesshire. The National Trust for Scotland's book \"The Scottish Kitchen\" by Christopher Trotter notes the Malcolm recipe and other old examples, expressing the belief that the dish was devised by Scottish regiments hankering for the tastes of India.\n\nHobson-Jobson cites Ibn Battuta (c. 1340) mentioning a dish of munj (moong) boiled with rice called kishrī and cites a recipe for khichri from Ain-i-Akbari (c. 1590). In Gujarat, where khichdi remains popular, the lentil and rice dish is usually served with kadhi, a spiced yogurt dish that can be mixed with the khichdi. Khichdi is usually not prepared with fish in Gujarat, although fish is sometimes eaten with khichdi in coastal villages where seafood is plentiful. According to Hobson-Jobson, while fish is eaten with kedgeree, the use of the term for \"mess of re-cooked fish ... is inaccurate\".\n\n"}

The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano. Spaghetti is the usual pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini is also used. Either guanciale or pancetta can be used. Another common substitute outside Italy is lardons of smoked bacon.\n\nThe dish was created in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nThe pasta is cooked in moderately salted boiling water. The guanciale is briefly fried in a pan without the use of oil (the fat of the guanciale will perform the same function as olive oil and prevent it from becoming too crispy). A mixture of raw eggs, grated pecorino (or a mixture of pecorino and Parmesan), and a good amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta away from additional direct heat to avoid curdling the egg, either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish. The fried guanciale is added, and the mixture is tossed, creating a creamy sauce. Although various pasta shapes can be used, the raw egg can only cook properly with a shape that has a sufficiently large ratio of surface area to volume, such as spaghetti, linguine or fettuccine.\n\nGuanciale is the most commonly used meat for the dish in Italy, but pancetta is also used and in English-speaking countries bacon is often used as a substitute. The usual cheese is Pecorino Romano, or occasionally Parmesan. Recipes differ in the use of egg: some use the whole egg, others only the yolk, and still others use a mixture.\n\nCream is not used in most Italian recipes, though there are exceptions; it is often used elsewhere. Garlic is similarly found mostly outside Italy.\nOther variations on carbonara outside Italy may include peas, broccoli, mushrooms, leeks or other vegetables. Many of these preparations have more sauce than the Italian versions and subsequently types of pasta better suited to holding sauce are used, such as penne.\n\nAs with many recipes, the origins of the dish and its name are obscure.\n\nThe dish forms part of a family of dishes involving pasta with bacon, cheese, and pepper, such as Pasta alla gricia. Indeed, it is very similar to the Italian pasta \"cacio e uova\", dressed with melted lard and a mixture of eggs and cheese.\n\nThere are many theories for the origin of the name, which may be more recent than the dish itself. Since the name is derived from \"carbonaro\" (the Italian word for charcoal burner), some believe the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers. In parts of the United States the etymology gave rise to the term \"coal miner's spaghetti\". It has even been suggested that it was created as a tribute to the \"Carbonari\" (\"charcoalmen\"), a secret society prominent in the early, repressed stages of Italian unification. It seems more likely that it is an urban dish from Rome, although it has nothing to do with the Roman restaurant of the same name.\n\nPasta alla carbonara is unrecorded before the Second World War; notably, it is absent from Ada Boni's 1930 \"La Cucina Romana\". The dish is first attested in 1950, when it was described in the Italian newspaper \"La Stampa\" as a dish sought by the American officers after the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944. It was described as a Roman dish, at a time when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by troops from the United States. It was included in Elizabeth David's \"Italian Food\", an English-language cookbook published in Great Britain in 1954.\n\n"}

However, this probably refers to the soft Tatar curd (katyk), which can be made into a drink (\"ayran\") by diluting it, and therefore refers to fermented, not fresh, milk concentrate.\n\nNicolas Appert condensed milk in France in 1820, and Gail Borden, Jr., in the United States in 1853, in reaction to difficulties in storing milk for more than a few hours. Before this development, milk could be kept fresh for only a short while and was available only in the immediate vicinity of a lactating cow. While returning from a trip to England in 1851, Borden was devastated by the deaths of several children, apparently from poor milk obtained from shipboard cows. With less than a year of schooling and following a series of failures, both of his own and of others, Borden was inspired by the vacuum pan he had seen being used by Shakers to condense fruit juice and managed to reduce milk without scorching or curdling it. Even then his first two factories failed and only the third, built with new partner Jeremiah Milbank in Wassaic, New York, produced a usable milk derivative that was long-lasting and needed no refrigeration.\n\nProbably of equal importance for the future of milk production were Borden's requirements (the \"Dairyman's Ten Commandments\") for farmers who wanted to sell him raw milk: they were required to wash the cows' udders before milking, keep barns swept clean, and scald and dry their strainers morning and night. By 1858, Borden's milk, sold as Eagle Brand, had gained a reputation for purity, durability and economy.\n\nIn 1864, Gail Borden's New York Condensed Milk Company constructed the New York Milk Condensery in Brewster, New York. This was the largest and most advanced milk factory of its day and was Borden's first commercially successful plant. More than 200 dairy farmers supplied 20,000 gallons (76,000 litres) of milk daily to the Brewster plant as demand increased driven by the American Civil War.\n\nThe U.S. government ordered huge amounts of condensed milk as a field ration for Union soldiers during the war. This was an extraordinary field ration for the nineteenth century: a typical 10-oz (300-ml) can contained 1,300 calories (5440 kJ), 1 oz (28 g) each of protein and fat, and more than 7 oz (200 g) of carbohydrate.\n\nSoldiers returning home from the war soon spread the word, and by the late 1860s condensed milk was a major product. The first Canadian condensery was built at Truro, Nova Scotia, in 1871. In 1899, E. B. Stuart opened the first Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company (later known as the Carnation Milk Products Company) plant in Kent, Washington. The condensed milk market developed into a bubble, with too many manufacturers chasing too little demand. In 1911, Nestlé constructed the world's largest condensed milk plant in Dennington, Victoria, Australia. By 1912, high stocks of condensed milk led to a drop in price and many condenseries went out of business.\n\nIn 1914, Otto F. Hunziker, head of Purdue University's dairy department, self-published \"Condensed Milk and Milk Powder: Prepared for the Use of Milk Condenseries, Dairy Students and Pure Food Departments\". This text, along with the additional work of Hunziker and others involved with the American Dairy Science Association, standardized and improved condensery operations in the United States and internationally. Hunziker's book was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press.\n\nThe First World War regenerated interest in, and the market for, condensed milk, primarily due to its storage and transportation benefits. In the U.S. the higher price for raw milk paid by condenseries created significant problems for the cheese industry.\n\nRaw milk is clarified and standardised to a desired fat to solid-not-fat (SNF) ratio, and is then heated to for several seconds. This heating process destroys some microorganisms, decreases fat separation and inhibits oxidation. Some water is evaporated from the milk and sugar is added until a 9:11 (nearly half) ratio of sugar to (evaporated) milk is reached. The sugar extends the shelf life of sweetened condensed milk. Sucrose increases the liquid's osmotic pressure, which prevents microorganism growth. The sweetened evaporated milk is cooled and lactose crystallization is induced.\n\nCondensed milk is used in recipes for the Brazilian candy \"brigadeiro\" (where condensed milk is the main ingredient), key lime pie, caramel candies, and other desserts. Condensed milk and sweetened condensed milk is also sometimes used in combination with clotted cream to make fudge in certain countries such as the United Kingdom.\n\nIn parts of Asia and Europe, sweetened condensed milk is the preferred milk to be added to coffee or tea. Many countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, use condensed milk to flavor their hot or iced coffee. In Malaysia and Singapore, \"teh tarik\" is made from tea mixed with condensed milk, and condensed milk is an integral element in Hong Kong tea culture. In the Canary Islands, it is served as the bottom stripe in a glass of the local café cortado and, in Valencia, it is served as a café bombón.\n\nBorden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk has noted that ice cream could be made quite simply at home with their product, cream, and various simple flavorings, being be ready to serve after as little as four hours.\n\nIn New Orleans, sweetened condensed milk is commonly used as a topping on chocolate or similarly cream-flavored snowballs. In Scotland, it is mixed with sugar and butter then boiled to form a popular sweet candy called tablet or Swiss milk tablet, this recipe being very similar to another version of the Brazilian candy brigadeiro called \"branquinho\". In some parts of the Southern United States, condensed milk is a key ingredient in lemon ice box pie, a sort of cream pie. In the Philippines, condensed milk is mixed with some evaporated milk and eggs, spooned into shallow metal containers over liquid caramelized sugar, and then steamed to make a stiffer and more filling version of \"crème\" caramel known as \"leche flan\", also common in Brazil under the name \"pudim de leite\".\n\nIn Mexico, sweetened condensed milk is one of the main ingredients of the cold cake dessert (the leading brand is \"La Lechera\", the local version of Swiss \"Milchmädchen\" by Nestlé), combined with evaporated milk, Marie biscuits, lemon juice, and tropical fruit. In Brazil, this recipe is also done exchanging fruit for puddings, most commonly vanilla and chocolate, known as \"pavê\" or \"torta de bolacha\". It is also used to make homemade \"dulce de leche\" by baking it in an oven. In Brazil, this is done by baking the unopened can in a \"bain-marie\", the result being \"doce de leite\". In Britain and Ireland, the contents of a boiled can is used as the layer between biscuit base and the banana and cream level in banoffee. In Latin American and Central American countries, condensed milk (along with evaporated milk and whole milk or canned cream) is used as a key ingredient in the tres leches cake dessert.\n\nIn Poland, it was once common to boil a can of condensed milk in water for about three hours. The resulting product – a sweet semi-liquid substance which can be used as a cake icing or put between dry wafers – essentially the same as \"dulce de leche\", is called \"kajmak\" (although the original kaymak is a product similar to clotted cream). Some manufacturers of condensed milk introduced canned, ready-made \"kajmak\" which now is widely commercially produced, and is a national favourite for the sweets fillings. In Russia, the same product is called \"varionaya sguschyonka\" (translates as \"boiled condensed milk\").\n\nCondensed milk can be made from evaporated milk by mixing one measure of evaporated milk with one and a quarter measures of sugar in a saucepan, then heating and stirring the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved, then cooling. It can also be made by simmering regular milk and sugar, until it is reduced by 60%.\n\n"}

{"id": "429272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429272", "title": "Chicken tikka masala", "text": "Chicken tikka masala\n\nChicken tikka masala is a dish of chunks of roasted marinated chicken (chicken tikka) in a spiced curry sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. There are multiple claims to its place of origin such as the Indian subcontinent and the United Kingdom. It is among the United Kingdom's most popular dishes.\n\nChicken tikka masala is chicken tikka (chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt) that is then baked in a tandoor oven, and served in a masala (spice mixture) sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and spices. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. The dish shares some similarity with butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.\n\nOther tikka masala dishes replace chicken with lamb, fish, or paneer.\n\nThe origin of the dish is not certain. Some trace the origins of the dish to the South Asian community in Britain. The \"Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics\" credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in the 1960s, after migrating from what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). At the time, most of Britain's Indian restaurants were owned and run by Bangladeshi chefs, who developed and served a number of new inauthentic \"Indian\" dishes, including chicken tikka masala. Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss various origin-claims of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef\". They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s \"Indian Cookery\" published in 1961\".\n\nAnother explanation is that it originated in an Indian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. This version recounts how a Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in the west end of Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from yogurt, cream, and spices. In 2013, his son Asif Ali told the story of its invention in 1971 to the BBC's \"Hairy Bikers\" TV cookery programme:\n\nIn July 2009, then British Member of Parliament Mohammad Sarwar tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons asking that Parliament support a campaign for Glasgow to be given European Union protected geographical status for chicken tikka masala. The motion was not chosen for debate, nor did Sarwar speak on this subject in Parliament.\n\nRahul Verma, a food critic who writes for \"The Hindu\", said he first tasted the dish in 1971 and that its origins were in Punjab, India. He said \"It's basically a Punjabi dish not more than 40–50 years old and must be an accidental discovery which has had periodical improvisations\".\n\nIn 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring:\nChicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world, including Indian restaurants in Britain and North America. According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it is the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry. It was previously Britain's most popular foreign dish to cook, up until it was overtaken by stir-fry in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "429276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429276", "title": "Naan", "text": "Naan\n\nNaan () is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread found in the cuisines mainly of West Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean. \n\nThe earliest appearance of \"naan\" in English is from 1803 in a travelogue of William Tooke. The Persian word \"nān\" 'bread' is attested in Middle Persian as \"n'n\" 'bread, food', which is of Iranian origin, and is a cognate with Parthian \"ngn\", Kurdish \"nan\", Balochi \"nagan\", Sogdian \"nγn-\", and Pashto \"nəγan\" 'bread'.\n\nThe form \"naan\" has a widespread distribution, having been borrowed in a range of languages spoken in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, where it usually refers to a kind of flatbread (tandyr nan). The spelling \"naan\" is first attested in 1979, and has since become the normal English spelling.\n\nNaan as known today originates from Asian Steppe. The most familiar and readily available varieties of naan in Western countries are those from the Indian subcontinent. In Iran, from which the word originated, \"nân\" () does not carry any special significance, as it is merely the generic word for any kind of bread, as well as in other West Asian nations or ethnic groups in the region.\n\nNaan in parts of the Indian subcontinent usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread (another well-known kind of flatbread is \"chapati\"). Generally, it resembles pita and, like pita bread, is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for \"roti\") is also used. Naan is cooked in a \"tandoor\", from which tandoori cooking takes its name. This distinguishes it from \"roti\", which is usually cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a \"tava\". Modern recipes sometimes substitute baking powder for the yeast. Milk or yogurt may also be used to impart distinct tastes to the naan. Milk used instead of water will, as it does for ordinary bread, yield a softer dough. Also, when bread starter (which contains both yeast and lactobacilli) is used, the milk may undergo modest lactic fermentation.\n\nTypically, it is served hot and brushed with some water but in some other cultures such as those in the Indian Subcontinent, they brush ghee or butter. It can be used to scoop other foods or served stuffed with a filling. \n\nA typical naan recipe involves mixing white or whole wheat flour with active dry yeast, salt, and water . The dough is kneaded for a few minutes, then set aside to rise for a few hours. Once risen, the dough is divided into balls (about 100 g or 3.5 oz each), which are flattened and cooked. In Pakistani cuisine, naans are typically flavored with fragrant essences, such as rose, \"khus\" (vetiver), or with butter or ghee melted on them. Nigella seeds are commonly added to naan as cooked in Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants throughout the UK.\n\nRaisins, lentils and spices can be added. Naan can also be covered with, or serve as a wrap for, various toppings of meat, vegetables, or cheeses. This version is sometimes prepared as fast food. It can also be dipped into such soups as \"dal\" and goes well with \"sabzis\" (also known as \"shaakh\").\n\n\"Naan bya\" () in Burma is sometimes served at breakfast with tea or coffee. It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with \"pè byouk\" (boiled peas) on top, or dipped in \"hseiksoup\" (mutton soup).\n\n\"Luri fiçá\" in Rohingya is similar to naan, but made of rice and served at festivals with beef, mutton, vegetables, and soups. It is a national cake of Rohingya in Arakan.\n\nNaan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough. Chefs and companies such as Nigella Lawson, and Wegmans offer recipes for people to make their own naan pizza at home.\n"}
{"id": "429277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429277", "title": "Roti", "text": "Roti\n\nRoti (also known as chapati) is a round flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta, and water that is combined into a dough. Roti is consumed in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Singapore, Maldives, Thailand, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It is also consumed in parts of Africa, Fiji, Mauritius and the Caribbean, particularly in Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, St Lucia, Guyana and Suriname. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. \"Naan\" from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is \"kulcha\".\n\nThe word \"roti\" is derived from the Sanskrit word रोटिका (\"rotikā\"), meaning \"bread\". Names in other languages are ; ; Nepali : रोटी; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Dhivehi: ރޮށި; ; . It is also known as \"maani\" in Sindhi, \"ruti\" in Bengali and \"phulka\" in Punjabi and Saraiki.\n\nMany variations of flatbreads are found in many cultures across the globe, from the Indian subcontinent to Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula to the Americas. The traditional flatbread from the Indian subcontinent is known as roti. It is normally eaten with cooked vegetables or curries; it can be called a carrier for them. It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a \"tawa\". Tandoori roti is cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature.\n\nLike breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods. In Iran, the two variants of this bread are called \"khaboos\" and \"lavash\". These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, probably the most popular type of roti is \"pol roti\" (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of \"sambol\" or \"lunu miris\" and considered a main meal rather than a supplement.\n\nAnother variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is \"kottu roti\", which is made up of \"paratha \"or \"godamba roti\", These are cut into small pieces, small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut \"paratha\" are added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done. The first person to make\" kottu roti\" is said to have made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton, and fish \"kottu roti\". It is sometimes prepared and served as a fast food dish.\n\n\"Godamba roti\" is another variety found in Sri Lanka. Plain\" godamba roti\" is eaten with curry or it can also be wrapped around a savory filling.\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional Indian breads.\n\nIn Thailand, โรตี refers to the \"maida\" \"paratha\"—known in Indonesia as \"roti maryam, roti cane\", or \"roti konde\", in Malaysia as \"roti canai\", and in Singapore as \"roti prata\".\n\nRoti is eaten widely across the Caribbean, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.\nThe roti wrap is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney being the most popular.\n\nThe roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean. Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and the wrapped roti a staple street food. The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti. As Indo-Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. This iconic version is what most North Americans known as roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies.\n\nVarious types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a \"tawa\". Certain rotis are also made with ghee or butter.\n\n\"Dotsi roti\" is common in Guyana. A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, vegetable oil is used, but butter, or margarine can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the \"tava\", so it softens but does not break.\n\nIn Suriname, roti refers mainly to \"dhalpuri\" or \"aloo puri\". It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the \"kousenband\" or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the \"aloo puri\" folded in fours on top. \n\nRoti, pronounced \"rooti\" in Durban, was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into Durban cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries.\n"}
{"id": "429939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429939", "title": "Inca Kola", "text": "Inca Kola\n\nInca Kola (also known as \"the Golden Kola\" in international advertising) is a soft drink that was created in Peru in 1935 by British immigrant Joseph Robinson Lindley\nusing lemon verbena (\"verbena de Indias\" or \"cedrón\" in Spanish). The soda has a sweet, fruity flavor that somewhat resembles its main ingredient, lemon verbena. Americans compare its flavor to bubblegum or cream soda. Sometimes categorized as a champagne cola, it has been described as \"an acquired taste\" whose \"intense color alone is enough to drive away the uninitiated.\"\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company owns the Inca Kola trademark everywhere but in Peru. In Peru, the Inca Kola trademark is owned by Corporación Inca Kola Perú S.A., which since 1999 is a joint venture between the Coca-Cola Company and the Lindley family, former sole owners of Corporación Inca Kola Perú S.A. and Corporación José R. Lindley S.A.\n\nInca Kola is a source of national pride and patriotism in Peru, a national icon. Inca Kola is available in parts of South America, North America and Europe, and while it has not enjoyed major success outside Peru, it can be found in Latin American specialty shops worldwide. Inca Kola is sold in bottles and with an Inca motif.\n\nIn 1910, in Rímac, one of Lima's oldest and most traditional neighborhoods, an immigrant English family began a small bottling company under their family name, Lindley. In 1928, the company was formally chartered in Peru as Corporación José R. Lindley S.A., whereupon Joseph R. Lindley became its first General Manager.\n\nBy the early 1930s, the company had a line of ten flavors of soda including Orange Squash, Lemon Squash, Champagne Kola, and Cola Rosada. In 1935, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Lima's founding, Lindley introduced what was to become its most noted product, Inca Kola, whose flavor was based on Lemon Verbena ( or ). He had experimented with various mixtures, other ingredients and levels of carbonation, until finally he came up with this combination of thirteen special plant-derived flavors. The company launched \"Inca Kola\" under the slogan \"There is only one Inca Kola and it's like no other\" ().\n\nBy the mid-1940s, Inca Kola was a market leader in Lima due to an aggressive advertising campaign. Appealing to the Peruvian nationalism that was prevalent among the population, the company positioned Inca Kola as a traditional Peruvian drink, using national and indigenous iconography and images. This advertising campaign was very successful, and bottling volume expanded greatly.\n\nInca Kola reached levels of 38% market penetration by 1970, eclipsing all other carbonated drinks in Peru and firmly establishing itself as \"Peru's Drink\" (). A common logo in the late 1970s and early 1980s featured the slogan \"Made of National Flavor!\" (), later changed to \"The taste of Peru\" ().\n\nOn January 22, 2009, Inca Kola partnered with D'Onofrio, an iconic Peruvian ice cream brand owned by Nestlé, to launch an Inca Kola flavored ice pop.\n\nIn the United States, Inca Kola is manufactured by the Coca-Cola company and sold in supermarkets in bottles, cans, and individual bottles.\n\nIt is one of eight international soda flavors featured and available for tasting at Club Cool in Epcot.\n\nIn 1995, Coca-Cola had 32% of the market share of soda sales in Peru while Inca Kola had 32.9%. Since that year, however, the market share for Inca Kola has increased due to some fast food chains including it in their menus. Bembos, a Peruvian fast-food chain, switched from serving Coca-Cola to Inca Kola in 1995. Due to popular demand, McDonald's also began to serve Inca Kola at its locations in Peru in 1995, before Coca-Cola owned the Inca Kola brand (at the time, the only place in the world where Coca-Cola agreed to such an arrangement).\n\nLindley underwent corporate restructuring in 1997. The expansion resulted in a debt load that took a heavy toll, and Lindley lost almost $5 million in 1999. The company, looking for outside help, turned to the Coca-Cola Co., which acquired half of Inca Kola Perú and one-fifth of Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. for an undisclosed sum believed to have been about $200 million. Johnny Lindley Taboada, a grandson of the founder and chairman of Corporación José R. Lindley S.A., became chairman of the joint venture between Coke and Inca Kola. Coca-Cola became the sole owner of the Inca Kola trademark everywhere outside Peru whereas inside Peru a joint-venture agreement was forged. To date, Ecuador and the United States (mostly New York and the rest of the Northeast) are two of the countries where Inca Kola is bottled by the Coca-Cola Company.\n\nDuring the time that the two giants were negotiating, various smaller companies began to emerge in Peru, selling drinks that competed both with Coca-Cola (Peru Cola, Cola Nacional, Inti Cola, Kola Real, etc.) and Inca Kola (Isaac Kola, Triple Kola, Concordia, Oro etc.). Their main selling point was the fact that Inca Kola was no longer a Peruvian company, having sold out to a foreign company, and therefore not deserving of their money.\n\nDuring 2004, Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. started talks to buy out Embotelladora Latinoamericana S.A., a bottling business that had been bottling Inca Kola since 1973. They complained that the price of Inca Kola concentrate had increased sixfold since the merger with Coca-Cola. Consequently, they cancelled their contract to bottle Inca Kola in 2000. As a result, in early 2005 Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. purchased two-thirds of Embotelladora Latinoamericana for $215 million. Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. now bottles Inca Kola as well as all the Coca-Cola products using these bottling facilities, with a combined market share of around 60%.\n\n\n\n"}

Various types of ice cream cones include wafer (or cake) cones, waffle cones, and sugar cones.\n\nMany styles of cones are made, including pretzel cones and chocolate-coated cones. A variety of double wafer cone exists that allows two scoops of ice cream to be served side by side. Wafer cones are sometimes made with a flat bottom instead of a pointed, conical shape, enabling the ice cream and \"cone\" to stand upright on a surface without support. These types of wafer cones are often branded as \"cups\".\n\nEdible cones were mentioned in French cooking books as early as 1825, when Julien Archambault described how one could roll a cone from \"little waffles\". Another printed reference to an edible cone is in \"Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book\", written in 1888 by Agnes B. Marshall (1855–1905) of England. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\".\n\nEdible cones were patented by two entrepreneurs, both Italian, separately in the years 1902 and 1903. Antonio Valvona, an ice cream merchant from Manchester, UK, patented a biscuit cup producing machine in 1902, and in 1903, Italo Marchioni, an italian ice cream salesman, filed for the patent of a machine which made ice cream containers.\n\nAt the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, a Syrian/Lebanese concessionaire named Arnold Fornachou was running an ice cream booth. When he ran short on paper cups, he noticed he was next to a waffle vendor by the name of Ernest Hamwi, who sold Fornachou some of his waffles. Fornachou rolled the waffles into cones to hold the ice cream - and this is believed by some (although there is much dispute) to be the moment where ice-cream cones became mainstream.\n\nAbe Doumar and the Doumar family can also claim credit for the ice cream cone. At the age of 16, Doumar began to sell paperweights and other items. One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor transplanted to Norfolk, Virginia from Ghent in Belgium, Leonidas Kestekidès. Doumar proceeded to roll up the waffle and place a scoop of ice cream on top. He then began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. His \"cones\" were such a success that he designed a four-iron baking machine and had a foundry make it for him. At the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, he and his brothers sold nearly twenty-three thousand cones. After that, Abe bought a semiautomatic 36-iron machine, which produced 20 cones per minute and opened Doumar's Drive In in Norfolk, Virginia, which still operates at the same location over 100 years later.\n\nIn 2008, the ice cream cone became the official state food of Missouri.\n\nThe earliest cones were rolled by hand, from hot and thin wafers, but in 1912, Frederick Bruckman, an inventor from Portland, Oregon, patented a machine for rolling ice cream cones. He sold his company to Nabisco in 1928, which is still producing ice cream cones as of 2017. Other ice-cream providers such as Ben & Jerry's make their own cones.\n\nIn 1918, a Lebanese immigrant, Albert George, started the George & Thomas Cone Company, and began to mass-produce baked ice cream cones to sell to restaurants, as well as the everyday consumer. That company became Joy Ice Cream Cone Company, now named the Joy Cone Company, located in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. The company has two facilities, its eastern facility located at 3435 Lamor Road in Hermitage, PA, and its western facility located at 2843 West Shamrell Blvd. in Flagstaff, Arizona. In July 2017, the company started construction of another $24 million plant at its Hermitage, PA location which will be fully operational in spring of 2018. The company produces over 2 billion ice cream cones (sugar, cake, and waffle cones) a year. Joy Cone is the largest ice cream cone maker in the world. The company is still owned/operated by the George family along with the employees as an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan). In September 2017, Joy Cone completed the purchase of BoDeans Baking Group, with its Le Mars, Iowa plants, along with a second subsidiary, Altesa, which makes ice cream cones and related products in Mexico City. This will permit Joy Cone to expand sales into Central America.\n\nIn 1928, J.T. \"Stubby\" Parker of Fort Worth, Texas created an ice cream cone that could be stored in a grocer's freezer, with the cone and the ice cream frozen together as one item. He formed The Drumstick Company in 1931 to market the product, and in 1991 the company was purchased by Nestlé.\n\nIn 1959, Spica, an Italian ice cream manufacturer based in Naples, invented a process whereby the inside of the waffle cone was insulated from the ice cream by a layer of oil, sugar and chocolate. Spica registered the name Cornetto in 1960. Initial sales were poor, but in 1976 Unilever bought out Spica and began a mass-marketing campaign throughout Europe. Cornetto is now one of the most popular ice creams in the world.\n\nIn 1979, a patent for a new packaging design by David Weinstein led to easier transportation of commercial ice cream cones. Weinstein's design enabled the ice cream cone to be wrapped in a wax paper package. This made the cones more sanitary while also preventing the paper wrapper from falling off during transportation, or from becoming stuck to the cone.\n\n"}

Laksa consists of thick wheat noodles or rice vermicelli with chicken, prawn or fish, served in spicy soup based on either rich and spicy curry coconut milk or on sour \"asam\" (tamarind or \"gelugur\"). Laksa is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Southern Thailand.\n\nThere are various theories about the origins of laksa. In Indonesia, the dish is believed to have been born from the Chinese coastal settlements and the mixing of cultures between Chinese merchants and the local cooking practices. Historians believe laksa is a dish that was born from actual intermarriage. In early coastal \"pecinan\" (Chinese settlement) in maritime Southeast Asia, it was only Chinese men that ventured abroad out from China to trade. When settling down in the new town, these Chinese traders and sailors set out to find local wives, and these women began incorporating local spices and coconut milk into Chinese noodle soup served to their husbands. This creates the hybrid Chinese-local (Malay or Javanese) culture called Peranakan culture. As Peranakan Chinese communities have blended their ancestors' culture with local culture, Peranakan communities in different places now demonstrate diversity according to the local flavour. \n\nIn Malaysia, the dish is believed to have been introduced by Chinese immigrants in Malacca. In Singapore, the dish (or its local \"Katong\" version) is believed to have been created after interaction between the Peranakans with the local Singaporeans.\n\nBecause laksa has different varieties across the region, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the dish. Nevertheless, numbers of laksa recipes has been developed along the trade channels of Southeast Asia—where the ports of Penang, Medan, Malacca, Singapore, Palembang, and Batavia (now Jakarta) are the major stops along the historic spice route. The intensive trade links among these port cities enables exchanges of ideas to took place, including sharing recipes.\n\nVarious recipes of laksas have gained popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia; and subsequently international recognition. Initially in July 2011, CNN Travel ranked Penang Asam Laksa 7th out of the 50 most delicious foods in the world. Its rank however, fell to number 26th after CNN held an online poll by 35,000 people, published in September 2011. Singaporean Curry Laksa on the other hand ranked in number 44th.\n\nIn Indonesia, laksa is one of the traditional comfort foods; the spicy warm noodle soup is much appreciated during cold rainy days. However, its popularity is somewhat overshadowed by \"soto\", a similar hearty warm soup dish, which is often consumed with rice instead of noodles. In modern households, it is common practice to mix and match the recipes of laksas; if traditional laksa noodle is not available, Japanese udon noodles might be used instead.\n\nThe type of laksa is based upon the soup base employed in its recipe; either rich and savoury coconut milk, fresh and sour \"asam\" (tamarind, \"gelugur\" or \"kokum\"), or the combination of the two. There are three basic types of laksa: \"curry laksa\", \"asam laksa\", and other variant that can be identified as either curry or asam laksa. Curry laksa is a coconut milk curry soup with noodles, while asam laksa is a sour, most often tamarind-based, soup with noodles. Thick rice noodles also known as laksa noodles are most commonly used, although thin rice vermicelli (\"bee hoon\" or \"mee hoon\") are also common, and some recipes might create their own rice noodle from scratch. Some variants might use other types of noodles; Johor laksa for example uses spaghetti, while a fusion recipe might use Japanese udon noodle.\n\nCurry laksa is a coconut-based curry soup. The main ingredients for most versions of curry laksa include bean curd puffs, fish sticks, shrimp, and cockles. Some vendors may sell chicken laksa. Laksa is commonly served with a spoonful of \"sambal\" chilli paste and garnished with Vietnamese coriander, or \"laksa leaf\", which is known in Malay as \"daun kesum\".\n\nThis is usually known as curry mee in Penang rather than curry laksa, due to the different kind of noodles used (yellow \"mee\" or \"bee hoon\", as opposed to the thick white laksa noodles). Curry mee in Penang uses congealed pork blood, a delicacy to the Malaysian Chinese community.\n\nThe term \"curry laksa\" is more commonly used in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Laksa is quite popular in Singapore, and curry laksa or \"nyonya\" laksa can be simply served as plain laksa, with just noodles and gravy, or with additional ingredients. Singaporean curry laksa ranked in number 44th of CNN World's 50 best foods. Recently, several modern twist of curry laksa has been developed, such as laksa \"yong tau foo\" which is stuffed tofu laksa, and a premium upgrade of lobster laksa.\n\nIn Indonesia, most of laksa variants are coconut milk-based soup, thus can be categorized into curry laksa. Common spices include turmeric, coriander, candlenut, lemongrass, garlic, shallot, and pepper cooked in coconut milk. Widely available \"daun kemangi\" (Indonesian lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of \"daun kesum\". \"Bihun\" or thin rice vermicelli is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe might add slices of \"ketupat\" or \"lontong\" rice cake. Bogor laksa uses ground \"oncom\" into its soup.\n\nVariants of curry Laksa include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsam laksa is a sour, fish and tamarind-based soup. Penang asam laksa listed at number 26 on \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" compiled by \"CNN Go\" in 2011. \"Asam\" is the Malay word for any ingredient that makes a dish taste sour (e.g. tamarind, \"gelugur\" or kokum). Laksa typically uses \"asam keping\", known as kokum in the English speaking world, which is a type of dried slices of sour mangosteens. The modern Malay spelling is \"asam\", though the spelling \"assam\" is still frequently used.\n\nThe main ingredients for asam laksa include shredded fish, normally \"kembung\" (small mackerel of the Rastrelliger genus), and finely sliced vegetables including cucumber, onions, red chillies, pineapple, lettuce, common mint, \"daun kesum\" (Vietnamese mint or laksa mint), and pink \"bunga kantan\" (torch ginger). Asam laksa is normally served with either thick rice noodles or thin rice noodles (vermicelli) and topped off with \"petis udang\" or \"hae ko\" (蝦膏), a thick sweet prawn-shrimp paste.\n\nVariants of asam laksa include:\n\nSeveral variants might combines both coconut milk and tamarind, fish, chicken, and prawn, thus can be identified as either curry or asam laksa.\n\n\n\nThe general differences between \"curry laksa\", \"asam laksa\", and \"Sarawak laksa\" are as follows:\n\nLaksa is simply referred to or ordered at a restaurant as laksa (curry laksa) or asam laksa. By default, laksa means the standard curry laksa while asam laksa refers to the standard Penang version. If a restaurant serves a non-standard version, the restaurant will qualify the laksa by the version being sold. For example, a restaurant serving Katong laksa will list Katong laksa on the menu.\n\n\nLaksa paste to cook laksa can be purchased from supermarkets. Laksa flavoured instant noodles are also available at supermarkets.\n\nIn 2009, as part of a national food branding exercise, Malaysian Minister of Tourism Ng Yen Yen attempted to claim ownership for regional dishes such as Laksa, Hainanese Chicken Rice, and Bak Kut Teh, claiming that others have \"hijacked their dishes\". This led to discontent with its regional neighbours. Ng later clarified that she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted \"and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed.\" To date, the results of the study have not been made public.\n\n\n\n"}

Many scholars believe that the image of Yomi was derived from ancient Japanese tombs in which corpses were left for some time to decompose.\n\nThe kanji that are sometimes used to transcribe \"Yomi\" actually refer to the mythological Chinese realm of the dead called Diyu or Huángquán (黄泉, lit. \"Yellow Springs\"), which appears in Chinese texts as early as the eighth century BCE. This dark and vaguely defined realm was believed to be located beneath the earth, but it was not until the Han Dynasty that the Chinese had a clearly articulated conception of an underworld below in contrast with a heavenly realm above. The characters are \"jukujikun\", i.e. were used without regard to the actual meaning of the word Yomi, which is unknown. With regard to Japanese mythology, Yomi is generally taken by commentators to lie beneath the earth and is part of a triad of locations discussed in Kojiki: , , and or . Yomi has also often been associated with the mythological realm of , also known as .\n\nYomi is ruled over by Izanami no Mikoto, the Grand Deity of Yomi (\"Yomo-tsu-Ōkami\" 黄泉大神). According to Kojiki, the entrance to Yomi lies in Izumo province and was sealed off by Izanagi upon his flight from Yomi, at which time he permanently blocked the entrance by placing a massive boulder (\"Chigaeshi no ōkami\" 道反の大神) at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi (\"Yomotsu Hirasaka\" 黄泉平坂 or 黄泉比良坂). Upon his return to Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, Izanagi noted that Yomi is a \"polluted land\" (\"kegareki kuni\"). This opinion reflects the traditional Shinto association between death and pollution. Later Susanoo takes this position over.\n\nSome Japanese Christian texts use 黄泉 to refer to what is called Hell in the English versions. For example, Revelation 6:8,\n\n"}

It was originally made with a barley-almond blend. It has a pronounced almond taste and is used to flavor many cocktails. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many Tiki drinks.\n\nAn early (but toxic) recipe for orgeat can be found in the The English and Australian Cookery Book: \"Take a pound and a quarter of bitter almonds, and half a pound of sweet almonds, which have been blanched, nine pounds of loaf sugar, six pints of water, and the rinds of three lemons. Pound the almonds in a mortar with the sugar, and add the water a little by degrees; then put the mixture on the fire with the lemon-peel. After a boil pour off the syrup and press the almonds, to extract the milk; add this to the syrup, and strain the whole through a sieve. When cold add a little orange flower water, and bottle the mixture. The orgeat is used as a summer drink, mixed with water, according to taste.\"\n\nBitter almonds as a general rule contain cyanide and can be lethal in large quantities.Napoleon Bonaparte died – reputedly in part from drinking too much orgeat that others had also concocted with additional poisons. For this reason modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption unless the person is allergic.\n\nThe word \"orgeat\" () is derived from the Latin \"hordeaceus\" \"made with barley\" through the French, where barley is called \"orge\". The Catalan word \"orxata\" has the same origin, though today the two drinks have little else in common.\n\nIn Tunisia and Libya, it is called rozata and is usually served chilled in wedding and engagement parties as a symbol of joy and purity because of its white colour and its fresh (flowery) flavor. It comes in many different flavours, such as traditional almond, banana, mango, pistachio, among others. In Suriname, there is a drink called \"\", which is a similar syrup made of sugar and almonds. Maltese \"ruġġata\" is made of almond and vanilla essence and may include cinnamon and cloves. In Cyprus and on the Greek islands of Chios and Nisyros, a similar syrup is known as soumádha (). Soumada has a very ancient history at least in Cyprus, stretching back into the Roman period, and it was given as an exotic delicacy by King Peter I of Cyprus to King Casimir the Great of Poland at the Congress of Kraków, held in Poland in 1364.\n\n"}

During Judaism's New Year, Rosh Hashanah, through the High Holidays and culminating in Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), one is to reflect upon one's wrongdoings over the year and both seek and offer forgiveness. People can act similarly during the Christian liturgical season of Lent, although the motive behind this holiday is more of sacrifice than of responsibility. In fact, the Methodist practice of New Year's resolutions came, in part, from the Lenten sacrifices. The concept, regardless of creed, is to reflect upon self-improvement annually.\n\nAt the end of the Great Depression, about a quarter of American adults formed New Year's resolutions. At the start of the 21st century, about 40% did. In fact, according to the American Medical Association, approximately 40% to 50% of Americans participated in the New Year's resolution tradition from the 1995 Epcot and 1985 Gallop Polls A study found 46% of participants who made common New Year's resolutions (e.g. weight loss, exercise programs, quitting smoking) were likely to succeed, over ten times as among those deciding to make life changes at other times of the year. \n\nSome popular resolutions are:\n\n\nIn a 2014 report, 35% of participants who failed their New Year's Resolutions admitted they had unrealistic goals, 33% of participants didn't keep track of their progress, and 23% forgot about them; about one in 10 respondents claimed they made too many resolutions. \n\nA 2007 study by Richard Wiseman from the University of Bristol involving 3,000 people showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail, despite the fact that 52% of the study's participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting, wherein resolutions are made in terms of small and measurable goals (e.g., \"lost a pound a week\" rather than \"lose weight\").\n"}
{"id": "435437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435437", "title": "Snow White and the Madness of Truth", "text": "Snow White and the Madness of Truth\n\nSnow White and the Madness of Truth () was a 2004 item of installation art by Swedish, Israeli-born composer and musician Dror Feiler and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sköld-Feiler. Feiler and Sköld-Feiler created the visuals and the music for the artwork together, which was installed in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named \"Snövit\" (\"Snow White\") carrying a smiling portrait of Hanadi Jaradat, a Palestinian suicide bomber who murdered 22 people. A text was written on the walls, and the sound of Bach's \"Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut\" (Cantata 199) played in the background. This piece begins with the words, \"My heart swims in blood / because the brood of my sins / in God's holy eyes / makes me into a monster\". According to the artists, the installation was made to \"call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things\".\n\nThe artwork became the centre of some controversy when the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, vandalized it claiming that it \"glorified suicide bombers,\" and was \"an expression of hatred for the Israeli people.\" Some argued that critics failed to understand the artists' central message about tolerance, freedom of thought, and diversity. Reactions to the piece have been compared to reactions to Steve Earle's song \"John Walker's Blues\", which appeared on his 2002 album \"Jerusalem\".\n\nAs scheduled, the artwork was removed from display on February 8, 2004. In 2011 the Feilers created a new installation called \"\"Once upon a time in the middle of winter\"\" based on the events.\n\nIn early 2004 the artwork briefly came to the attention of the international media after it was vandalized on January 16 by Zvi Mazel, the Israeli ambassador to Sweden. Mazel disconnected the electricity powering the installation and tipped one of its lights into the water, causing a short circuit. When Mazel was asked to leave he refused and had to be escorted out by museum security. The entire event was filmed by the museum's security cameras.\n\nMazel later gave contradicting statements about the event. To the Swedish media, he said it was done in the heat of the moment, but to Israeli media he said it was premeditated and that he had planned it even before he saw the artwork. On January 20, Feiler appeared in Nyhetsmorgon on Swedish TV4 and explained that the white boat symbolized truth; and if an individual believed that their views were the absolute embodiment of truth, the end result could well be the pool of blood depicted in the installation.\n\nAccording to Sköld-Feiler, the name Snow White was chosen simply because in her portrait, Hanadi Jaradat resembled Snow White with her black hair, pale skin and red lips.\n\nThe installation was a part of the Making Differences exhibition at the Swedish History Museum. On January 18, 2004, Thomas Nordanstad, who is responsible for the exhibition, was attacked by an unidentified man who tried to push Nordanstad down a staircase. Nordanstad had also recently received over 400 e-mails containing various threats. Both Kristian Berg, head of the museum, and the artists also received many threats. The following Sunday, a museum guard had to remove a group of people who were throwing various objects into the water.\n\nAfter the attack on Nordanstad the number of visitors to the museum increased to approximately 1,400 per day, up from roughly the same number per week.\n\nAccording to Swedish Dagens Nyheter journalist Henrik Brors there may have been hidden motives behind Zvi Mazel's act. He speculated that it may have been done in an effort to discredit Sweden and the European Union by depicting them as antisemites, and to have the EU back down from its peace efforts in the Middle East. In the analysis in Dagens Nyheter Brors further speculated that Mazel may have done it to give Israel an excuse for not attending the international anti-genocide conference Stockholm International Forum that was to be held in Stockholm January 26–28.\n\nThe situation escalated further when Israel Army Radio incorrectly reported that a \"pro Israeli\" film was removed from the exhibition at the request of Syria. Both Thomas Nordanstad and Kristian Berg demonstrated that this allegation was false, as the documentary in question, \"Map\" by award-winning Israeli film maker Amit Goren, remained as part of the exhibition. It is believed that the erroneous rumour probably started when the display was moved from Tensta Konsthall due to some internal problems. During the whole time, another work by Goren, the film \"119 Bullets + Three\" was also on display. The display of Goren's works is sponsored by the Israeli embassy, and the cultural attache, Lizzie Oved Scheja, stated that the exhibit had their absolute support.\n\nThe Young Christian Democrats, the youth organisation of the Swedish Christian Democratic party, reported the artwork to the police in hope that action could be taken pursuant to Sweden's strict laws against hate speech. Mazel himself asked in an interview \"If we Jews say that this offends us, why can't a government remove it?\".\n\nStockholms Lokaltrafik decided to remove advertising of the Making Differences exhibit that used a picture of Hanadi Jaradat; those posters were a part of C. M. V. Hausswolff's artwork \"God made me do it\" and had nothing to do with Feiler/Sköld installation \"Snow White and the Madness of Truth.\"\n\nAn e-mail protest organized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center has been directed at Prime Minister Göran Persson's office. By the morning of January 27, 2004, 13,603 emails had been received.\n\nKristian Berg stated that \"I did not hear anyone who saw the work say that it was an anti-Semitic installation, against the Jewish people or against the Israeli people, I therefore think that this work was politically hijacked – the interpretation that Ambassador Mazel gave it was very narrow and very political.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "436825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436825", "title": "Geriatrics", "text": "Geriatrics\n\nGeriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. Rather, this decision is determined by the individual patient's needs, and the availability of a specialist. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people, and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term \"geriatrics\" comes from the Greek γέρων \"geron\" meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός \"iatros\" meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.\n\nGeriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. The aged body is different physiologically from the younger adult body, and during old age, the decline of various organ systems becomes manifest. Previous health issues and lifestyle choices produce a different constellation of diseases and symptoms in different people. The appearance of symptoms depends on the remaining healthy reserves in the organs. Smokers, for example, consume their respiratory system reserve early and rapidly.\n\nGeriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but renal failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function.\n\nThe decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Multiple problems may compound: A mild fever in elderly persons may cause confusion, which may lead to a fall and to a fracture of the neck of the femur (\"broken hip\").\n\nElderly people require specific attention to medications. Elderly people particularly are subjected to polypharmacy (taking multiple medications). Some elderly people have multiple medical disorders; some have self-prescribed many herbal medications and over-the-counter drugs. This polypharmacy may increase the risk of drug interactions or adverse drug reactions. In one study, it was found that prescription and nonprescription medications were commonly used together among older adults, with nearly 1 in 25 individuals potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. Drugs metabolites are excreted mostly by the kidneys or the liver, which may be impaired in the elderly, necessitating medication adjustment.\n\nThe presentation of disease in elderly persons may be vague and non-specific, or it may include delirium or falls. (Pneumonia, for example, may present with low-grade fever and confusion, rather than the high fever and cough seen in younger people.) Some elderly people may find it hard to describe their symptoms in words, especially if the disease is causing confusion, or if they have cognitive impairment. Delirium in the elderly may be caused by a minor problem such as constipation or by something as serious and life-threatening as a heart attack. Many of these problems are treatable, if the root cause can be discovered.\n\nThe so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. These include immobility, instability, incontinence and impaired intellect/memory.\n\nImpaired vision and hearing loss are common chronic problems among older people. Hearing problems can lead to social isolation, depression, and dependence as the person can no longer talk to other people, receive information over the telephone, or engage in simple transactions, such as talking to a person at a bank or store. Vision problems lead to falls from tripping over unseen objects, medicine being taken incorrectly because the written instructions could not be read, and finances being mismanaged.\n\nFunctional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. Elderly people generally want to live independently as long as possible, which requires them to be able to engage in self-care and other activities of daily living. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate.\n\nFrail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Frail people are also at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care, and an accurate prediction—based on validated measures, rather than how old the patient's face looks—can help older patients make fully informed choices about their options. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) who were living at home before the surgery have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.\n\nSome diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including:\n\n\n\n\nOne of the eight branches of the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, is \"jara\" or \"rasayana\", similar to geriatrics. Charaka described the fatigue and physical exhaustion caused by premature aging as the result of a poor diet. The \"Charaka Samhita\" recommends that elderly patients avoid excessive physical or mental strain and consume a light but nutritious diet.\n\nA number of physicians in the Byzantine Empire studied geriatrics, with doctors like Aëtius of Amida evidently specializing in the field. Alexander of Tralles viewed the process of aging as a natural and inevitable form of marasmus, caused by the loss of moisture in body tissue. The works of Aëtius describe the mental and physical symptoms of aging. Theophilus Protospatharius and Joannes Actuarius also discussed the topic in their medical works. Byzantine physicians typically drew on the works of Oribasius and recommended that elderly patients consume a diet rich in foods that provide \"heat and moisture\". They also recommended frequent bathing, massaging, rest, and low-intensity exercise regimens.\n\nIn \"The Canon of Medicine\", written by Avicenna in 1025, the author was concerned with how \"old folk need plenty of sleep\" and how their bodies should be anointed with oil, and recommended exercises such as walking or horse-riding. Thesis III of the \"Canon\" discussed the diet suitable for old people, and dedicated several sections to elderly patients who become constipated.\n\nThe Arab physician Algizar (circa 898–980) wrote a book on the medicine and health of the elderly. He also wrote a book on sleep disorders and another one on forgetfulness and how to strengthen memory, and a treatise on causes of mortality. Another Arab physician in the 9th century, Ishaq ibn Hunayn (died 910), the son of Nestorian Christian scholar Hunayn Ibn Ishaq, wrote a \"Treatise on Drugs for Forgetfulness\".\n\nGeorge Day published the \"Diseases of Advanced Life\" in 1849, one of the first publications on the subject of geriatric medicine. The first modern geriatric hospital was founded in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1881 by doctor Laza Lazarević.\n\nThe term \"geriatrics\" was proposed in 1909 by Dr. Ignatz Leo Nascher, former Chief of Clinic in the Mount Sinai Hospital Outpatient Department (New York City) and a \"father\" of geriatrics in the United States.\n\nModern geriatrics in the United Kingdom began with the \"mother\" of geriatrics, Dr. Marjorie Warren. Warren emphasized that rehabilitation was essential to the care of older people. Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. She found that patients, some of whom had previously been bedridden, were able to gain some degree of independence with the correct assessment and treatment.\n\nThe practice of geriatrics in the UK is also one with a rich multi-disciplinary history. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people.\n\nAnother innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the \"giants\" of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Isaacs asserted that, if examined closely enough, all common problems with older people relate to one or more of these giants.\n\nThe care of older people in the UK has been advanced by the implementation of the National Service Frameworks for Older People, which outlines key areas for attention.\n\nIn the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. or M.D.) who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation. They serve in a variety of roles including hospital care, long-term care, home care, and terminal care. They are frequently involved in ethics consultations to represent the unique health and diseases patterns seen in seniors. The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas some focus on community geriatrics. While originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialisation of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. In contrast to the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom; geriatricians are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists.\n\nIn Canada, there are two pathways that can be followed in order to work as a physician in a geriatric setting.\nMany universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents.\n\nIn India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering training and 3 year post graduate residency (M.D) training can be joined for after completing the 5.5 year undergraduate training of MBBS. Unfortunately, only four major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine.\n\nIn July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP). The domains are: cognitive and behavioral disorders; medication management; self-care capacity; falls, balance, gait disorders; atypical presentation of disease; palliative care; hospital care for elders, and health care planning and promotion. Each content domain specifies three or more observable, measurable competencies.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing issue facing geriatrics is the treatment and prevention of delirium. This is a condition in which hospitalized elderly patients become confused and disoriented when confronted with the uncertainty and confusion of a hospital stay. The health of the patient will decline as a result of delirium and can increase the length of hospitalization and lead to other health complications. The treatment of delirium involves keeping the patient mentally stimulated and oriented to reality, as well as providing specialized care in order to ensure that her/his needs are being met.\n\nThe Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) is an model of hospital care developed at the Yale University School of Medicine. It is designed to prevent delirium and functional decline among elderly individuals in the hospital inpatient setting. HELP uses a core team of interdisciplinary staff and targeted intervention protocols to improve patients' outcomes and to provide cost-effective care. Unique to the program is the use of specially trained volunteers who carry out the majority of the non-clinical interventions.\n\nIn up to 40% of the cases, incident delirium can be prevented. To that end, HELP promotes interventions designed to maintain cognitive and physical functioning of older adults throughout the hospitalization, maximize patients' independence at discharge, assist with the transition from hospital to home and prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. Customized interventions include daily visitors; therapeutic activities to provide mental stimulation; daily exercise and walking assistance; sleep enhancement; nutritional support and hearing and vision protocols.\n\nHELP has been replicated in over 63 hospitals across the world. Although the majority of the sites are based in the United States located in 25 different states, there is a growing international presence. International sites include: Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.\n\nPharmacological constitution and regimen for older people is an important topic, one that is related to changing and differing physiology and psychology.\n\nChanges in physiology with aging may alter the absorption, the effectiveness and the side effect profile of many drugs. These changes may occur in oral protective reflexes (dryness of the mouth caused by diminished salivary glands), in the gastrointestinal system (such as with delayed emptying of solids and liquids possibly restricting speed of absorption), and in the distribution of drugs with changes in body fat and muscle and drug elimination.\n\nPsychological considerations include the fact that elderly persons (in particular, those experiencing substantial memory loss or other types of cognitive impairment) are unlikely to be able to adequately monitor and adhere to their own scheduled pharmacological administration. One study (Hutchinson et al., 2006) found that 25% of participants studied admitted to skipping doses or cutting them in half. Self-reported noncompliance with adherence to a medication schedule was reported by a striking one-third of the participants. Further development of methods that might possibly help monitor and regulate dosage administration and scheduling is an area that deserves attention.\n\nAnother important area is the potential for improper administration and use of potentially inappropriate medications, and the possibility of errors that could result in dangerous drug interactions. Polypharmacy is often a predictive factor (Cannon et al., 2006). Research done on home/community health care found that \"nearly 1 of 3 medical regimens contain a potential medication error\" (Choi et al., 2006).\n\nElderly persons sometimes cannot make decisions for themselves. They may have previously prepared a power of attorney and advance directives to provide guidance if they are unable to understand what is happening to them, whether this is due to long-term dementia or to a short-term, correctable problem, such as delirium from a fever.\n\nGeriatricians must respect the patients' privacy while seeing that they receive appropriate and necessary services. More than most specialties, they must consider whether the patient has the legal responsibility and competence to understand the facts and make decisions. They must support informed consent and resist the temptation to manipulate the patient by withholding information, such as the dismal prognosis for a condition or the likelihood of recovering from surgery at home.\n\nElder abuse is the physical, financial, emotional, sexual, or other type of abuse of an older dependent. Adequate training, services, and support can reduce the likelihood of elder abuse, and proper attention can often identify it. For elderly people who are unable to care for themselves, geriatricians may recommend legal guardianship or conservatorship to care for the person or the estate.\n\nElder abuse occurs increasingly when caregivers of elderly relatives suffer from mental illness. These instances of abuse can be prevented by engaging these individuals with mental illness in mental health treatment. Additionally, interventions aimed at decreasing elder reliance on relatives may help decrease conflict and abuse. Family education and support programs conducted by mental health professionals may also be beneficial for elderly patients to learn how to set limits with relatives with psychiatric disorders without causing conflict that leads to abuse.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round \"Pfannenpickert\" the size of a pan, a rectangular \"Kastenpickert\", or a palm-sized regular \"Pickert\". The name is derived from Low German \"picken\", \"pecken\" (\"to stick something onto something else\").\n\nThe main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10–15 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4–5 people.\n\nPickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields. They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or leberwurst.\n\nA related dish, \"Lappenpickert\", is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards Münster and the Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of sweet cream added. \"Lappenpickert\" is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or cold cuts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "438210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438210", "title": "Barq's", "text": "Barq's\n\nBarq's , is an American soft drink. Its brand of root beer is notable for having caffeine.<ref name=\"http://www.overcaffeinated.org/database/soda-pop/barqs-root-beer.php\">Caffeine Database | Caffeine and Ingredients in Barqs Rootbeer, OverCaffeinated.org's Report on the Ingredients in Barq's Rootbeer</ref> Barq's, created by Edward Barq and bottled since the turn of the 20th century, is owned by the Barq family but bottled by the Coca-Cola Company. It was known as Barq's Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer until 2012.\n\n\nThe Barq's Brothers Bottling Company was founded in 1890 in the French Quarter of New Orleans, by Edward Charles Edmond Barq and his older brother, Gaston. The Barq Brothers bottled carbonated water and various soft drinks of their own creation. Early on their most popular creation was an orange-flavored soda called \"Orangine\", which won a gold medal at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nEdward Barq moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1897 with his new wife. The following year he opened the Biloxi Artesian Bottling Works. 1898 is often given as the debut year for what was later to be known as \"Barq's root beer,\" but some sources say this particular product was not produced until some two years later.\n\nIt was on the Mississippi coast that Barq met and employed a young boy, Jesse Robinson. Robinson was mentored by Barq and later moved to New Orleans to find his fortune. In 1934 Edward Barq, Sr. and Robinson sign a contractual agreement on Barq's product rights. The agreement was unique from other franchises in many aspects. For one thing, Robinson was allowed to make his own concentrate. The two men remained close their entire lives, working on flavors and production challenges. A distinctive difference between the Biloxi-based root beer and the Louisiana's was that the Louisiana bottle was printed in red (versus Biloxi's blue). This was to distinguish ownership of bottles as blue labeled ones were returned to Mississippi and vice versa. There were also regional taste differences between the various Barq's bottlers. While there may have been minor formula differences, water generally defined these differences.\n\nFor many decades Barq's was not marketed as a \"root beer.\" This was in part a desire to avoid legal conflict with the Hires Root Beer company, which was attempting to claim a trademark on the term \"root beer.\" It was also due to differences from other root beers at the time. The formulation was sarsaparilla based, contained less sugar, had a higher carbonation, and less of a foamy head than other brands.\n\nThe traditional slogan was the simple affirmation \"Drink Barq's. It's good\" which first appeared on the classic diamond-necked bottle, patented in 1935 by Ed Barq.\n\nIn 1976, the Biloxi Barq's Company was purchased from the third generation of Barq family members by John Oudt and John Koerner. An aggressive television campaign was developed based on the \"Barq's Got Sparks\" theme. Their plans to market the brand nationally were complicated by the existence of the Louisiana-based Barq's companies which were owned and operated by Robinson's heirs.\n\nThere were extended legal conflicts over the rights and ownership of the trademark Barq's, Barq's Sr. and Barq's Root Beer. The legal battle went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which ruled in favor of the Robinson heirs. The last family-held Louisiana Barq's was sold by Robinson's heirs to Coca-Cola in 2000.\n\nIn 1990, Barq's partnered with the Pick N Save grocery store in Dekalb, Illinois to create the World's Largest Root Beer Float. It was mixed in an above ground swimming pool in the parking lot and consisted of 1,500 gallons of Barq's root beer and 1,000 gallons of vanilla ice cream.\n\nIn recent years Barq's has been marketed with the slogan \"Barq's has bite!\"\n\nRegular Barq's has 22.5 mg of caffeine per 12 ounce serving (similar to green tea), while Diet Barq's has no caffeine. Barq's also contains sodium benzoate as a flavor protectant, which under the right conditions, is a precursor to the known carcinogen benzene.\n\nThe Barq's that is dispensed from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines is caffeine-free. This is because the system uses the same concentrated, microdosed ingredient for both Barq's and Diet Barq's; the only difference between the two is the sweetener that is added.\n\n"}

Ale-8 could be described as a ginger pop with a \"kick\". It is a ginger and citrus blend, containing less carbonation, and fewer calories than conventional soda.\n\nIt is bottled by the Ale-8-One Bottling Company in Winchester, Kentucky.\n\nThe formula for Ale-8-One was developed by soda bottler G. L. Wainscott in the 1920s. Wainscott, who had been in the soda business in Winchester, Kentucky since 1902, had developed Roxa-Kola, his previous flagship product, in 1906. In creating the formula for Ale-8-One, Wainscott drew upon his knowledge of ginger-based recipes acquired in northern Europe.\n\nWainscott began bottling Ale-8-One in 1926. To choose a name for the drink, he sponsored a name-the-product contest; \"A Late One\" was chosen as the winning entry. The \"Ale-8-One\" logo is a pun of the phrase suggesting that his product was \"the latest thing\" in soft drinks.\n\nIn 1935, Wainscott purchased a livery stable in Winchester and converted it to a bottling factory to expand his operation. Upon Wainscott's death in 1944, half of his company stock went to his wife; the other half was divided among his employees. When his wife died in 1954, her stock was left to her brother, Frank A. Rogers, Sr. Rogers bought the remaining company stock in 1962 and incorporated the Ale-8-One Bottling Company. He named his son, Frank Rogers, Jr. manager of the new company.\n\nThe Ale-8-One Bottling Company constructed a new plant in Winchester in 1965. It ceased production of Roxa-Kola in 1968, and by 1974, had halted production of all its other drinks to focus on Ale-8-One. The company remains under the control of the Rogers family.\n\nThe recipe for Ale-8 is a closely guarded family secret. Reportedly, only two executives—former company president Frank A. Rogers, III and his oldest son, Fielding Rogers, the current president—know the exact composition.\n\nIn 2003, the company announced limited distribution of Diet Ale-8, its first new product since the introduction of the original Ale-8 in 1926. Diet Ale 8 contains 44 mg of caffeine and no sugars. The diet variety is sweetened with a mixture of acesulfame potassium and sucralose.\n\nCaffeine Free Diet Ale 8 followed in March 2011. In addition to not having any caffeine, it is also sweetened with Splenda.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, Cherry Ale 8 was released, making it the first flavored Ale-8-One. It was first available exclusively in fountain drink form, then it became available in bottles.\n\nFor much of its history, Ale-8 was only available in central and eastern portions of Kentucky. In April 2001, the Ale-8-One Bottling Company expanded its distribution to areas of southern Ohio, and southern Indiana, through an agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises. Later, distribution to eastern Tennessee and far western Virginia was added. \n\nIn July 2015, Ale-8 announced plans to expand production into Indianapolis. \n\nIn 2016, Cracker Barrel began distributing the drink nationwide in all of its locations. In 2017, The Fresh Market began distributing Ale-8 and Diet Ale-8 in their stores in the eastern and Midwestern United States.\n\nAle-8 was briefly shown in the movie \"Prince Avalanche\", when a trucker offered bottles of it to the two main characters.\n\nAle-8 was seen in the 2005 film \"Elizabethtown\", where Orlando Bloom's character wears an Ale-8 T-shirt and drinks Ale-8 on a number of occasions throughout the film.\n\nAle-8 is featured in the FX drama \"Justified\", which is set in and around Lexington and the hill country of Eastern Kentucky.\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}
{"id": "438952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438952", "title": "Tzedakah", "text": "Tzedakah\n\nTzedakah or Ṣ'daqah in Classical Hebrew () (Arabic : A-Sadaqah الصدقة ), is a Hebrew word literally meaning \"justice\" or \"righteousness\", but commonly used to signify \"charity\" Notably, this concept of \"charity\" is different from the modern Western understanding of \"charity\", which is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity, as \"tzedakah\" is rather an ethical obligation. In Judaism, \"tzedakah\" refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes is an important part of living a spiritual life. Thus, unlike voluntary philanthropy, \"tzedakah\" is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and is considered mandatory even for those of limited financial means. More broadly, \"tzedakah\" is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.\n\nThe word \"tzedakah\" is based on the Hebrew (צדק, \"Tzedek\") meaning \"righteousness\", \"fairness\" or \"justice\", and is related to the Hebrew word \"Tzadik\", meaning \"righteous\" as an adjective (or \"righteous individual\" as a noun in the form of a substantive). Although the word appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, typically in relation to \"righteousness\" \"per se\", its use as a term for \"charity\" in the above sense is an adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in Talmudic times.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of \"tzedakah\", where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient, instead of living upon others; in his view, the second highest form of \"tzedakah\" is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation. The term \"tzedekah\" occurs 157 times in the Masoretic Text, typically in relation to \"righteousness\" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural \"tzedekot\", in relation to acts of charity. In the Septuagint this was sometimes translated as \"eleemosyne\", \"almsgiving.\"\n\nIn classical rabbinical literature, it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6) the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b) it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.\n\nMaimonides lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the \"Mishneh Torah\", \"Hilkhot matanot aniyim\" (\"Laws about Giving to Poor People\"), Chapter 10:7–14:\n\n\nIn practice, most Jews carry out \"tzedakah\" by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people that they may encounter; the perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of \"tzedakah\" still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice \"ma'sar kesafim,\" tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.\n\nSpecial acts of \"tzedakah\" are performed on significant days; at weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity, to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage; at Passover, a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers, and feed them at the table; at Purim it is considered obligatory for every Jew to give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people, in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during the month.\n\nAs for the more limited form of \"tzedakah\" expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of \"gleanings\" from certain crops, the Shulchan Aruch argues that during the exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it. Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow \"gleanings\" to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just \"gleanings\") by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during sabbatical years.\n\nIn addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be sure that your Tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively \"Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor,\" (Proverbs 22:22) and from Talmudic-era commentaries including Numbers Rabba 5:2. It is taught that Tzedakah money was never yours to begin with; rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.\n\nThere are many examples of Tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including Hands on Tzedakah (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in Israel), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). Paamonim is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle.\n\nGaon of Vilna considered about giving Tzedaqah \"to all householders in our city with tax-benefit\".\n\nThe primary counterpart in Islam is Zakat (Arabic: زكاة), as that refers to one's religious obligation based on those Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "439536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439536", "title": "Pierogi", "text": "Pierogi\n\nPierogi ( ) are filled dumplings of Central and Eastern European origin, made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savory or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water, or pan-frying. Pierogi which consist of noodle dough and have to be cooked in boiling water are associated with the Central and Eastern European kitchens where they are considered national dishes, especially in Poland. Pierogi are popular in West Slavic (Polish, Slovak), Hungarian, East Slavic (Belarusian, Ukrainian and Russian), some Baltic (Latvian and Lithuanian) and other Central and Eastern European cuisines, where they are known under their local names. \n\nTypical fillings include potato, sauerkraut, ground meat, cheese and fruits. The dumplings may be served with a topping, such as melted butter, sour cream or fried onion, or a combination of those ingredients.\n\nThe English word \"pierogi\" (plural: \"pierogi\", \"pierogies\", or \"pierogis\") comes from Polish ' , which is the plural form of ' , a generic term for filled dumplings. It derives from Old East Slavic (') and further from Proto-Slavic *pirъ, \"feast\". While dumplings as such are found throughout Eurasia, the specific name \"pierogi\", with its Proto-Slavic root and its cognates in the West and East Slavic languages, including Russian (', \"pie\") and (\"\", \"baked pastries\"), shows the name's common Slavic origins, antedating the modern nation states and their standardized languages. In most of these languages the word means \"pie\".\n\n\"Varenyky\" comes from Ukrainian ('), the plural form of ('), which derives from Ukrainian (\"\") \"boiling liquid\", indicating boiling as the primary cooking method for this kind of dumpling.\n\n\"Bryndzové pirohy\" is the Slovakian term for dumplings filled with sheep milk cheese.\n\n\"Colțunași\" is Romanian term for filled dumplings. It is derived from Greek , itself a borrowing from Italian .\n\nThe origins of pierogi are disputed. Some legends say that pierogi came from China through Italy from Marco Polo's expeditions. Others contend that pierogi were brought to Poland by Saint Hyacinth of Poland, who brought them back from Kiev (the center of Kievan Rus', nowadays the capital of Ukraine). On July 13, 1238, Saint Hyacinth visited Kościelec, and on his visit, a storm destroyed all crops; Hyacinth told everyone to pray and by the next day, crops rose back up. As a sign of gratitude, people made pierogi from those crops for Saint Hyacinth. Another legend states that Saint Hyacinth fed the people with pierogi during a famine caused by an invasion by the Tatars in 1241. Yet another legend that holds that pierogi were brought by the Tatars to the West from the former Russian Empire, it has been said that in the 13th century, pierogi had first arrived on Polish territories. None of these legends is supported by the etymological origin of the root \"pirŭ-\" from the proto-Slavic for \"feast\". While the origin of the pierogi is often under debate, the exact origin of the dish is unknown and unverifiable. It likely originated somewhere in Central Europe or Eastern Europe, and has been consumed in these regions long before any of the present political nations existed. Today, it is a large part of many Central European and Eastern European cultures.\n\nPierogi may be stuffed (singularly or in combinations) with mashed potatoes, fried onions, quark or farmer cheese, cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, mushrooms, spinach, cheese, or other ingredients depending on the cook's preferences. Dessert versions of the dumpling can be stuffed with sweetened quark or with a fresh fruit filling such as cherry, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, apple or plum; stoned prunes are sometimes used, as well as jam. For more flavor, sour cream can be added to the dough mixture, and this tends to lighten the dough.\n\nThe dough, which is made by mixing flour and warm water, sometimes with an egg, is rolled flat and then cut into squares with a knife or circles using a cup or drinking glass. The dough can be made with some mashed potato, creating a smoother texture. Another variation popular among Czechs and Slovaks, uses dough made of flour and curd with eggs, salt, and water.\n\nThe filling is placed in the middle and the dough folded over to form a half circle or rectangle or triangle if the dough is cut squarely. The seams are pressed together to seal the pierogi so that the filling will remain inside when it is cooked. The pierogi or vareniki are simmered until they float, drained, and then sometimes fried or baked in butter before serving or fried as leftovers. They can be served with melted butter or sour cream, or garnished with small pieces of fried bacon, onions, and mushrooms. Dessert varieties may be topped with apple sauce, jam, or \"varenye\".\n\nVarenyky are crescent- or more rarely square-shaped. They are stuffed with fillings such as mashed potato, ground meat, liver or offal, cabbage, sauerkraut, fish, hard-boiled egg, or a combination of these. Typical sweet fillings include quark or cottage cheese, or fruits such as sour cherries, berries, and currants. Compared to Russian \"pelmeni\", varenyky are usually larger include a much broader selection of traditional fillings. In case of varenyky meat-based filling, it is usually cooked and then minced. The cooking is required due to the larger size of varenyky and generally brief cooking time.\n\nDuring preparation, the filling is wrapped with dough, boiled for several minutes in salted water, and then covered with butter or cooking oil. In certain regions of Ukraine, varenyky are steamed instead of boiled.\n\nSavoury varenyky are typically topped with fried salo bits (\"shkvarky\") and onions and accompanied with \"smetana\" (sour cream). Leftover varenyky can be fried. As a dessert, varenyky are served with \"smetana\" and sugar, \"varenye\" (jam) or honey. Raw varenyky (with the dough uncooked) can be stored frozen, then cooked in a few minutes, which makes them a convenience food. Other preparation methods include the Latvian tradition of glazing with egg white, baking, and serving with soup; the Mennonite tradition bakes and serves them with borscht.\n\nTraditionally considered peasant food, pierogi eventually gained popularity and spread throughout all social classes including nobles. Some cookbooks from the 17th century describe how during that era, the pierogi were considered a staple of the Polish diet, and each holiday had its own special kind of pierogi created. Different shapes and fillings were made for holidays such as Christmas and Easter. Important events like weddings had their own special type of pierogi kurniki – filled with chicken. Also, pierogi were made especially for mournings or wakes, and some for caroling season in January.\nPierogi are an important part of Polish culture and cuisine today. They are served in a variety of forms and tastes (ranging from sweet to salty to spicy) in Polish cuisine, considered to be the national dish. They are served at many festivals, playing an important role as a cultural dish. At the 2007 Pierogi Festival in Kraków, 30,000 pierogi were consumed daily.\nPolish pierogi are often filled with fresh quark, boiled and minced potatoes, and fried onions. This type is called in Polish \"pierogi ruskie\", which literally means \"Ruthenian pierogi\" (sometimes being mistranslated as “Russian pierogi”). \"Ruskie pierogi\" are probably the most popular kind of pierogi in North America. This variety is not necessarily the most popular in Europe, although very much liked. The most popular in Poland are pierogi filled with ground meat, mushrooms and cabbage, or for dessert an assortment of fruits (berries, with strawberries or blueberries the most common).\n\nSweet pierogi are usually served with sour cream mixed with sugar, and savory pierogi with bacon fat and bacon bits. Poles traditionally serve two types of pierogi for Christmas Eve supper. One kind is filled with sauerkraut and dried mushrooms, anothersmall \"uszka\" filled only with dried wild mushroomsis served in clear borscht. \"Leniwe pierogi\" (\"lazy pierogi\") are a different type of food, similar to lazy vareniki (see below), \"kopytka\", or \"halušky\".\n\nVarenyky in Ukraine are a popular dish, served both as a common everyday meal and as a part of some traditional celebrations, such as Christmas Eve Supper, Ukrainian: Свята вечеря (Sviata Vecheria). In some regions in or bordering modern-day Western Ukraine, particularly in Carpathian Ruthenia and Galicia, the terms \"varenyky\" and \"pyrohy\" are used to denote the same dish. The name \"pyrohy\" is also common among Canadian Ukrainians. This can be attributed to the history of Ukrainian and Rusyn immigration to Canada, which came not from the Russian Empire, but predominantly from the former Austria-Hungary, where the local dialects had many common words with Polish, German, Romanian, and other Central European languages.\n\nIn other regions of Ukraine, the names \"pyrohy\" and \"pyrizhky\" refer to baked pies and buns as opposed to the boiled dumplings. The name of a popular type of Polish pierogi, \"pierogi ruskie\" (\"Ruthenian pierogi\"), is related to Rus', the historical region and naming of Eastern Slavs and the ancient kingdom from which Ukrainians descend. \n\nVarenyky are considered by Ukrainians as one of their national dishes and plays a fundamental role in Ukrainian culture. Contrary to many other countries that share these dumplings Ukrainians tended to use fermented milk products (Ukrainian: \"kesla moloko\" or Ryazhenka) to bind the dough together however today eggs tend to be used instead. Typical Ukrainian fillings for varenyky include cottage cheese, potato, boiled beans, mushy peas, sauerkraut, plum (and other fruits), potato and cheese, cabbage, meat, fish, buckwheat.\n\nIn Ukraine varenyky are traditionally eaten with sour cream Ukrainian: сметана (smetana) and butter, as well as with fried onions and fried pieces of bacon and pork fat, Ukrainian: \"shkvarky\". Whilst traditionally savoury varenyky can also be served as a dessert by simply substituting the filling of the dumpling to a sweeter one. Dessert varenyky fillings include sour cherry, blueberries, sweet cottage cheese, billberies and other fruits. The central regions of Ukraine famous for their more unusual varenyky, Poltava being known for its flour varenyky filling-the dumplings are filling with a mixture of flour, lard and fried pieces of bacon .\n\nVarenekyky are so favoured in Ukraine that every year there is a festival commemorating them at the Ukrainian ski resort town of Bukovel in the Carpathian Mountains. In 2013 a snow monument to varenyky was made in Bukovel and applied for the Guiness Book of Records as the biggest snow varenyk in the world. \n\nIn Ukraine varenyky are not just a national dish, but also played a symbolic and ritualistic role. Ukrainian ancestors equated varenyk with a young moon since they have a similar shape and used the dumplings as part of pagan and sacrificial rituals. For example cheese varenyky would be sacrificed nears water springs and years ago Ukrainian peasants also believed that varenyky helped bring a rich harvest, so they took homemade dumplings along to the fields.\n\nA traditional dish in Slovak cuisine is \"bryndzové pirohy\", dumplings filled with salty bryndza cheese mixed with mashed potatoes. \"Brydzové pirohy\" are served with some more bryndza (mixed with milk or sour cream, so it has texture of a liquid and serves as a dip) and topped with bacon or fried onion. In Slovakia, \"pirohy\" are semicircular shaped.\n\nAlong with bryndzové halušky, \"brydzové pirohy\" is one of Slovakia's national dishes.\n\n\"Ajdovi krapi\" (literally buckwheat carps) are a dish popular in north-eastern and Alpine regions of Slovenia. Made with buckwheat rather than wheat flour and filled with a mixture of cottage cheese (\"skuta\"), millet, and fried onions, they are traditionally topped with pork fat crisps, fried bacon or fried onion, but today often with butter breadcrumbs. Along with žganci and štruklji, they form a trio of buckwheat based dishes typical of Slovenian cuisine.\n\nPierogi are not to be confused with the Russian baked good Pirozhki. Furthermore, the Ukrainian varenyky are widespread in the western and in the Asian regions of Russia. Mostly they are filled in Russia with cherries, quark, fruits, wild berries, blue berries, potatoes, cabbage or beef.\n\nIn Hungarian cuisine, the \"derelye\" is similar of pierogi, pasta pockets filled with jam, cottage cheese, or sometimes meat. Derelye is consumed primarily as a festive food for special occasions such as weddings. And also used as common meals, (at least in the southern parts,) but as many other traditions this becomes rare. \n\nIn Romania, a similar recipe is called \"colțunași\", in Transylvania and Bukovina called \"piroști\" and in Moldova called \"chiroște\". \"Colţunaşi\" is often a dessert filled with jam (usually plum), fresh sour cherries or cottage cheese, or savory, filled with dill seasoned cheese (telemea or urdă), mashed potatoes or chopped meat. The dough is made with wheat flour and the colțunași are boiled in salted water, pan-fried in oil or baked in the oven.\n\nThe word is a cognate with Slavic \"kalduny\", a type of dumplings.\n\nIn both Bukovina and Transylvania, the name \"piroști\" is used in Romanian families of German or Slavic origin and the filling can also be a whole, fresh, seedless plum. The term \"colțunaș\" is used by native Romanian families and are usually filled with cottage cheese or quark and served topped with sour cream smântână, traditionally called \"colțunași cu smântână\".\n\nThe common term \"Pirogge\" (pl. \"Piroggen\") describes all kinds of Eastern European filled dumplings and buns, including pierogi, pirozhki, pirogs and pīrādziņi. Certain types of piroggen, both boiled and baked, were common fare for Germans living in Eastern Europe and are still prepared by their descendants living there and in Germany. In particular, baked pīrādziņi are known as \"Kurländer Speckkuchen\" (\"Courland bacon/speck pies\") in the cuisine of Baltic Germans.\n\nDishes closely resembling pierogi are common in southern German-speaking regions. In particular, \"Schlutzkrapfen\" are common in Tirol and in northern Italy's German-speaking region of South Tyrol, and are occasionally found in Bavaria. Fillings may include meat or potatoes, but the most widespread filling is a combination of spinach and quark (\"Topfen\") or ricotta. Another similar Austrian dish, known as \"Kärntner Nudel\" (Carinthian noodles), is made with a wide range of fillings, from meat, mushrooms, potato or quark to apples, pears or mint. These regional specialties differ significantly from the most common German filled dumplings known as \"Maultaschen\".\n\nPierogi are widespread in Canada and the United States, having been popularized by Central and Eastern European immigrants. They are particularly common in areas with large Polish, Ukrainian, or Ruthene populations, such as Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Chicago, Omaha, Massachusetts, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and New Jersey in the United States, and the provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario in Canada. Pierogi at first were a family food among immigrants as well as being served in ethnic restaurants. In the post-World War II era, freshly cooked pierogi became a staple of fundraisers by ethnic churches. By the 1960s, pierogi were a common supermarket item in the frozen food aisles in many parts of the United States and Canada. Pierogi have maintained their place in grocery stores to this day.\n\nWhile pierogi are often eaten as a main dish in Canada and European countries, Americans often consider them a side dish, frequently served with meat.\n\nNumerous towns with Central and Eastern-European heritage celebrate the pierogi. The city of Whiting, Indiana, celebrates the food at its Pierogi Fest every July. Pierogis are also commonly associated with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania especially, where there is a \"pierogi race\" at every home Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game. In the race, six runners wearing pierogi costumes race toward a finish line. In 1993, the village of Glendon in Alberta, Canada, erected a roadside tribute to this culinary creation: a 25-foot (7.6 m) fibreglass perogy (preferred local spelling), complete with fork.\n\nThe United States enjoys the most developed pierogi market because of its having the largest Central and Eastern European immigrant population in North America (Canada being second). Unlike other countries with newer populations of European settlers, the modern pierogi is found in a wide selection of flavors throughout grocery stores in the United States. Many of these grocery-brand pierogi contain non-traditional ingredients to appeal to American tastes, including spinach, jalapeño and chicken.\n\nPierogi enjoyed a brief popularity as a sports food when Paula Newby-Fraser adopted them as her food of choice for the biking portion of the 1989 Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. For more than a decade thereafter, Mrs. T's (the largest American pierogi manufacturer) sponsored triathlons, some professional triathletes and \"fun runs\" around the country. For many triathletes, pierogi represented an alternative to pasta as a way to boost their carbohydrate intakes. However, the pierogi trend in the United States is not dying. Several cities such as San Diego now have their own pierogi trucks with popular flavors and restaurants across the United States from San Francisco, Seattle, to New York City are adding gourmet pierogi flavors to their menus.\n\nAccording to pierogi manufacturer Mrs. T's, based in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, pierogi consumption in the United States is largely concentrated in a geographical region dubbed the \"Pierogi Pocket\", an area including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Chicago, Detroit, parts of the northern Midwest and southern New England which accounts for 68 percent of annual US pierogi consumption.\nCanada has a large Polish population, and an even larger Ukrainian or Rusyn population, and their \"pyrohy\", \"perogy\" or \"pyrogy\" are very common. Since Canada also has immigrants from many other perogy-making people (such as the Mennonites), a wide diversity of recipes are used. The Canadian market for perogi is second only to that of the U.S. market, the latter having been the destination of choice for the majority of Central and Eastern European immigrants before and during World War II.\n\nPacked frozen pierogi can be found wherever Central and Eastern European immigrant communities exist and are generally ubiquitous across Canada, even in big chain stores. Typically frozen flavours include analogs of \"ruskie pierogi\" filled with potato and either Cheddar cheese, onion, bacon, cottage cheese or mixed cheeses. Home-made versions are typically filled with either mashed potatoes (seasoned with salt and pepper and often mixed with dry curd cottage cheese or cheddar cheese), sauerkraut, or fruit. These are then boiled, and either served immediately, put in ovens and kept warm, or fried in oil or butter. Popular fruit varieties include strawberry, blueberry, and saskatoon berry.\n\nPotato and cheese or sauerkraut versions are usually served with some or all the following: butter or oil, sour cream (typical), fried onions, fried bacon bits or kielbasa (sausage), and a creamy mushroom sauce (less common). Some ethnic kitchens will deep-fry perogies; dessert and main course dishes can be served this way. A good method is to par-boil the dumplings, then after drying, they are pan fried or deep-fried.\n\nThe frozen varieties are sometimes served casserole-style with a mixture of chopped ham, onions, peppers and cheddar cheese or with an Italian-style mixture of ground beef, onions and tomato sauce.\n\nNational chain restaurants feature the dish or variations. Boston Pizza has a sandwich and a pizza flavoured to taste like perogies, while Smitty's serves theirs as an appetizer deep-fried with salsa. Some Chinese cafés in the Canadian Prairies have taken to billing their dumplings (jiaozi) as \"Chinese pierogies\".\n\nAlthough called \"varenyky\" in standard Ukrainian, speakers of the Canadian Ukrainian or Rusyn dialect refer to them as \"pyrohy\", which can be misheard \"pedaheh\" or \"pudaheh\" by Anglophones unaccustomed to the rolled-r sound, or alveolar flap. This is due to the history of Ukrainian or Rusyn (Ruthenian) immigration to Canada, which came predominantly from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\n\"Lazy varenyky\" (, ) in Russian and Ukrainian cuisine or \"leniwe pyrohy\" in Rusyn are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made by mixing tvoroh (curd cheese) with egg and flour into quick dough. The cheese-based dough is formed into a long sausage about 2 cm thick, which is cut diagonally into gnocchi, called halushky in Ukrainian and Rusyn, \"galushki\" in Russian. The dumplings are then quickly boiled in salted water and served with sour cream or melted butter. The name \"lazy varenyky\" faithfully reflects the very quick preparation time of the dish: It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes from assembling the simple ingredients to serving the cooked dumplings. Lazy varenyky differ from standard varenyky in the same way that Italian gnocchi differ from ravioli or tortellini: these are fluffy solid dumplings, not stuffed pockets of dough. The same dish in Polish cuisine is called \"lazy pierogi\" ().\n\nPierogi are probably the only Polish dish that has its own patron saint. \"Święty Jacek z pierogami!\" (St. Hyacinth and his pierogi!) is an old Polish expression of surprise, roughly equivalent to the English language \"good grief\" or American \"holy smokes!\" The origin of this expression is unknown.\n\nIn Ukrainian literature varenyky appeared as a symbol of national identity, sometimes stressing its distinction from Russian. In the poem by Stepan Rudansky \"Varenyky-Varenyky\" (1858), a Russian soldier is asking a Ukrainian countrywoman to cook varenyky for him. However, he cannot bring to mind the word \"varenyky\", while the woman pretends not to understand him.\n\nThe Great Pittsburgh Pierogi Race N'at, commonly called the Great Pierogi Race, is an American mascot race between innings during a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game that features six contestants racing in giant pierogi costumes: Potato Pete (blue hat), Jalapeño Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow hat), Sauerkraut Saul (red hat), Oliver Onion (purple hat), and Bacon Burt (orange hat).\n\nA monument to varenyky (\"right\") was inaugurated in Cherkasy, Ukraine in September 2006. The monument erected at the entrance to a hotel shows Cossack Mamay (a Ukrainian folklore hero whose fondness for varenyky was narrated by Taras Shevchenko and Nikolay Gogol) eating varenyky from an earthenware pot, with a huge crescent-shaped varenyk behind him.\n\nA monument to halushky was inaugurated in Poltava, Ukraine in 2006. In 1991, a giant perogy on a fork was erected in the village of Glendon in Alberta, Canada. The statue is 7.6 m (24.9 ft) tall. In January 2010, a pierogi statue was proposed to be erected in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n"}
{"id": "439544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439544", "title": "Pirozhki", "text": "Pirozhki\n\nPirozhki (, plural form of pirozhok, literally a \"small pie\"), (Ukrainian: пиріжки, Pyrizhky) also transliterated as piroshki (singular piroshok) are a Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian puff pastry which consists of individual-sized baked or fried buns stuffed with a variety of fillings. The stress in \"pirozhki\" is properly placed on the last syllable: . \"Pirozhok\" (, singular) is the diminutive form of the Russian \"pirog\" (пирог), which refers to a full-sized pie. (Unless the full-sized pie is called by the diminutive name for purely stylistic reasons.) Pirozhki are not to be confused with the pierogi/varenyky of Ukraine, Poland, and Slovakia (Eastern Europe/Central Europe).\nA common variety of pirozhki are baked stuffed buns made from yeast dough and often glazed with egg to produce the common golden color. They commonly contain meat (typically beef) or a vegetable filling (mashed potatoes, mushrooms, onions and egg, or cabbage). Pirozhki could also be stuffed with fish (e.g., salmon) or with an oatmeal filling mixed with meat or giblets. Sweet-based fillings could include stewed or fresh fruit (apples, cherries, apricots, chopped lemon, etc.), jam, quark or cottage cheese. The buns may be plain and stuffed with the filling, or else be made in a free-form style with strips of dough decoratively encasing the filling.\n\nVariations on the use of yeast dough can be American style pie crust short dough or multilayered pastry dough similar to that found in croissants.\n\nPirozhki can be a reasonable size, slightly smaller than a hamburger, with several eaten as a meal unto themselves. Another version is smaller, about the size (width and length) of two fingers, and is usually served in pairs accompanying soup.\n\nPotatoes among American crops became very popular when the vegetable was brought and adopted to the Eurasian climate. Before then, the ingredient was not available as it took more time to acclimate to continental regions like Russia and Ukraine. Before then, the ingredients would contain more vegetables and fruits, as well as duck, goose and rabbit meat, uncommon today.\n\nThe Greek variety \"piroski\" () is popular in parts of Greece influenced by eastern cuisine and in most big cities, where they are sold as a type of fast food. The Greek \"pirouskia\" come deep-fried with many different stuffings.\n\nIn Serbia the local variety are cylindrical pastries called пирошка/piroška (piroshka). They are stuffed with fillings such as ground spiced meat mix of pork and veal or cottage cheese, and with kulen, tomato sauce and herbs. Alternatively they are made from breaded crepes with variety of fillings.\n\nIn Latvia crescent-shaped buns of leavened dough called speķrauši (literally, \"fatback tarts\") or speķa pīrāgi (often referred to in diminutive \"speķa pīrādziņi\" or colloquially simply \"pīrāgi\" or \"pīrādziņi\") are traditionally filled with smoked fatback and onion. Other fillings are also possible. However the name \"pīrāgi\" is not exclusive to these buns, but can refer to variety of other pastries, such as pies and turnovers. \"Pīrāgi\" were often eaten as lunch by farmers and shepherds working the fields.\n\nEstonians too have this tradition. The \"pirukad\" are fairly small in size and have regional variations in respect to fillings. \"Pirukad\" are sometimes accompanied by bouillon. Many recipes exist, with meat, cabbage, carrots, rice, egg and other fillings and filling mixtures also being used. The Latvian bacon and onion version is known to Estonians, but is not as common. One can also encounter sweet fillings, although savory \"pirukad\" predominate.\n\nKarelian pasties (\"karjalanpiirakat\" plural or \"karjalanpiirakka\" singular, in the South Karelian dialect of Finnish and \"karjalanpiiraat\" plural or \"karjalanpiiras\" singular in the North Karelian dialect) are a differently shaped pie popular in both Karelia and Finland. Compared to the Baltic pirukas and pīrāgi, the Karelian pastries are open-faced.\n\nPirozhki are common as fast food on the streets of the Central Asian countries in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, where they were introduced by the Russians. They are also made by many Russians and non-Russians at home.\n\nPirozhki is also very common as fast food in Mongolia, and it is made throughout the country by families at home.\n\nThe Russian variant of Pirozhki is a common fast food in Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia it often contains a potato or seasoned meat filling. In Azerbaijan, it is often eaten as a dessert and is commonly filled with cream.\n\nThe Iranian version, pirashki ( ), is often eaten as a dessert or as a street food. It is commonly filled with cream, but potato and meat fillings are also available. The Iranian sweet shops in Los Angeles have invented other versions such as chocolate and blueberries.\n\nA Japanese version, called ピロシキ (\"piroshiki\"), are predominantly fried, use fillings such as ground meat, boiled egg, bean noodles, spring onion etc., and are commonly breaded with panko before frying, in the manner of Japanese \"menchi-katsu\". Another popular variation is filled with Japanese curry and is quite similar to \"karē-pan\", which is itself said to be inspired by pirozhki.\n\nVarieties of pirozhki were brought to the Americas by Volga Germans. Known today as bierock, \"pirok\" or runza, they belong to several regional cuisines in the United States, Canada and Argentina. The populous Russian diaspora which came to the Americas as a consequence of the Russian Revolution and Civil War brought with them the more classic Russian versions of piroshki.\n\n"}

This reconstructed root is widely represented in Tibeto-Burman languages; for instance, \"ma\" means \"not\" in both Written Tibetan and Written Burmese.\n\nThe Standard Chinese pronunciation of \"wú\" 無 \"not; nothing\" historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) Middle Chinese \"mju\", (c. 3rd century CE) Late Han Chinese \"muɑ\", and reconstructed (c. 6th century BCE) Old Chinese *\"ma\".\n\nOther varieties of Chinese have differing pronunciations of . Compare Cantonese \"mou4\"; and Southern Min (Quanzhou) and (Zhangzhou).\n\nThe common Chinese word \"wú\" 無 was adopted in the Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies. The Japanese \"kanji\" 無 has \"on'yomi\" readings of \"mu\" or \"bu\", and a \"kun'yomi\" (Japanese reading) of \"na\". The Korean \"hanja\" 無 is read \"mu\" (in Revised, McCune–Reischauer, and Yale romanization systems). The Vietnamese Hán-Việt pronunciation is \"vô\" or \"mô\".\n\nSome English translation equivalents of \"wú\" or \"mu\" 無 are:\n\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean it is commonly used in combination words as a prefix to indicate the absence of something, e.g., / / \"museon\" (무선 ) for \"wireless\". In Classical Chinese, it is an impersonal existential verb meaning \"not have\".\n\nThe same character is also used in Classical Chinese as a prohibitive particle, though in this case it is more properly written .\nIn traditional Chinese character classification, the uncommon class of phonetic loan characters involved borrowing the character for one word to write another near-homophone. For instance, the character 其 originally depicted a \"ji\" \"winnowing basket\", and scribes used it as a graphic loan for \"qi\" 其 \"his; her; its\", which resulted in a new character \"ji\" 箕 (clarified with the bamboo radical ⺮) to specify the basket.\n\nThe character \"wu\" 無 originally meant \"dance\" and was later used as a graphic loan for \"wu\" \"not\". The earliest graphs for 無 pictured a person with outstretched arms holding something (possibly sleeves, tassels, ornaments) and represented the word \"wu\" \"dance; dancer\". After \"wu\" 無 \"dance\" was borrowed as a loan for \"wu\" \"not; without\", the original meaning was elucidated with the 舛 \"opposite feet\" at the bottom of \"wu\" 舞 \"dance\".\n\n\"The Gateless Gate\", which is a 13th-century collection of Chan or Zen kōans, uses the word \"wu\" or \"mu\" in its title (\"Wumenguan\" or \"Mumonkan\" 無門關) and first kōan case (\"Zhao Zhou's Dog\" 趙州狗子). Chinese Chan calls the word \"mu\" 無 \"the gate to enlightenment\". The Japanese Rinzai school classifies the Mu Kōan as \"hosshin\" 発心 \"resolve to attain enlightenment\", that is, appropriate for beginners seeking \"kenshō\" \"to see the Buddha-nature\"'.\n\nCase 1 of \"The Gateless Gate\" reads as follows:\n\nThe koan originally comes from the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\" (), \"The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Zhao Zhou\", koan 132:\n\nThe \"Book of Serenity\" , also known as the \"Book of Equanimity\" or more formally the \"Hóngzhì Chánshī Guǎnglù\" , has a longer version of this koan, which adds the following to the start of the version given in the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\".\n\nIn the original text, the question is used as a conventional beginning to a question-and-answer exchange (mondo). The reference is to the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" which says for example:\nKoan 363 in the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\" shares the same beginning question.\n\nThis koan is one of several traditionally used by Rinzai school to initiate students into Zen study, and interpretations of it vary widely. Hakuun Yasutani of the Sanbo Kyodan maintained that\nThis koan is discussed in Part 1 of Hau Hoo's \"The Sound of the One Hand: 281 Zen Koans with Answers\". In it, the answer of \"negative\", mu, is clarified as although all beings have potential Buddha-nature, beings who do not have the capacity to see it and develop it essentially do not have it. The purpose of this primary koan to a student is to free the mind from analytic thinking and into intuitive knowing. A student who understands the nature of his question would understand the importance of awareness of potential to begin developing it.\n\nThe Japanese scholar Iriya Yoshitaka made the following comment on the two versions of the koan:\nA similar critique has been given by Steven Heine:\nThe term is often used or translated to mean that the question itself must be \"unasked\": no answer can exist in the terms provided. Zhaozhou's answer, which literally means that dogs do not have Buddha nature, has been interpreted by Robert Pirsig and Douglas Hofstadter to mean that such categorical thinking is a delusion, that yes and no are both correct and incorrect.\n\nIn Robert M. Pirsig's 1974 novel \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", \"mu\" is translated as \"no thing\", saying that it meant \"unask the question\". He offered the example of a computer circuit using the binary numeral system, in effect using \"mu\" to represent high impedance:\nThe word features prominently with a similar meaning in Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book, \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\". It is used fancifully in discussions of symbolic logic, particularly Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to indicate a question whose \"answer\" is to\n\n\"Mu\" may be used similarly to \"N/A\" or \"not applicable,\" a term often used to indicate the question cannot be answered because the conditions of the question do not match the reality. A layperson's example of this concept is often invoked by the loaded question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\", to which \"mu\" would be the only respectable response.\n\nBecause of this meaning, programming language Perl 6 uses \"Mu\" for the root of its type hierarchy.\n\nIn the Japanese manga series, \"Death Note\", ends in a thematic conclusion which contains MU's usage as \"not applicable\": \"All humans, without exception, will eventually die. The place they go after is MU (無, Nothingness)\".\n\nTsugumi Ohba, the writer of \"Death Note\", explained in the postmortem follow-up volume that the meaning behind \"MU after death\" was that \"the dead person should never come back to life, and it's cheating to revive dead characters as manga. So it became MU\". Ohba further explained that \"all humans die someday, and when we die, we can never come back to life, so let's do our best while we are at it\" was the single most important theme Ohba wanted to express in writing the series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "440995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440995", "title": "Ambigram", "text": "Ambigram\n\nAn ambigram is a word, art form or other symbolic representation whose elements retain meaning when viewed or interpreted from a different direction, perspective, or orientation.\n\nDouglas R. Hofstadter describes an ambigram as a \"calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves.\" Different ambigram artists (sometimes called \"ambigramists\") may create completely different ambigrams from the same word or words, differing in both style and form.\n\nThe earliest known non-natural ambigram dates to 1893 by artist Peter Newell. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of invertible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when turned upside down. The last page in his book \"Topsys & Turvys\" contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In \"Topsys & Turvys Number 2\" (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nThe Verbeek strip \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\" used ambigrams in 3 consecutive strips in March,1904, but otherwise the format of this strip prevented the use of word balloons.\n\nFrom June to September, 1908, the British monthly \"The Strand\" published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column. Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose \"chump\" was published in June, wrote, \"I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity,\" while Clarence Williams wrote, about his \"Bet\" ambigram, \"Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly.\"\n\nIn 1969, Raymond Loewy designed the rotational NEW MAN ambigram logo, which is still in use today. The mirror ambigram DeLorean Motor Company logo was first used in 1975.\n\nJohn Langdon and Scott Kim also each believed that they had invented ambigrams in the 1970s. Langdon and Kim are probably the two artists who have been most responsible for the popularization of ambigrams. John Langdon produced the first mirror image logo \"Starship\" in 1975. Robert Petrick, who designed the invertible \"Angel\" logo in 1976, was also an early influence on ambigrams.\n\nThe earliest known published reference to the term \"ambigram\" was by Hofstadter, who attributed the origin of the word to conversations among a small group of friends during 1983–1984. The original 1979 edition of Hofstadter's \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" featured two 3-D ambigrams on the cover.\n\nAmbigrams became more popular as a result of Dan Brown incorporating John Langdon's designs into the plot of his bestseller, \"Angels & Demons\", and the DVD release of the \"Angels & Demons\" movie contains a bonus chapter called \"This is an Ambigram\". Langdon also produced the ambigram that was used for some versions of the book's cover. Brown used the name Robert Langdon for the hero in his novels as an homage to John Langdon.\n\nIn music, the Grateful Dead have used ambigrams several times, including on their albums \"Aoxomoxoa\" and \"American Beauty\".\n\nIn the first series of the British show \"Trick or Treat\", the show's host and creator Derren Brown uses cards with rotational ambigrams. These cards can read either 'Trick' or 'Treat'.\n\nAlthough the words spelled by most ambigrams are relatively short in length, one DVD cover for \"The Princess Bride\" movie creates a rotational ambigram out of two words: \"Princess Bride,\" whether viewed right side up or upside down.\n\nIn 2015 iSmart's logo on one of its travel chargers went viral because the brand's name turned out to be a natural ambigram that read \"+Jews!\" upside down. The company noted that \"...we learned a powerful lesson of what not to do when creating a logo.”\n<ref name=\"iSmart/Jews!\"></ref>\n\nAmbigrams are exercises in graphic design that play with optical illusions, symmetry and visual perception. Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their form and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and there are different ways of approaching problems. A number of books suggest methods for creation (including \"WordPlay\" and \"Eye Twisters\").\n\nComputerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed. The earliest, the 'Ambimatic' created in 1996, was letter-based and used a database of 351 letter glyphs in which each letter was mapped to another.

Crush mainly competes with Coca-Cola's Fanta. It was created in 1911 by Canadian beverage and extract chemist Neil C. Ward. Most flavors of Crush are caffeine-free.\n\nIn 1911, Clayton J. Howel, president and founder of the Orange Crush Company, partnered with Neil C. Ward and incorporated the company. Ward made the recipe for Orange Crush. Howel was not new to the soft drink business, having earlier introduced Howel’s Orange Julep. Soft drinks of the time often carried the surname of the inventor along with the product name. Howel sold the rights to use his name in conjunction with his first brand; therefore, Ward was given the honors: Crush was first premiered as Ward's Orange Crush. Originally, Orange Crush included orange pulp in the bottles, giving it a \"fresh squeezed\" illusion even though the pulp was added rather than remaining from squeezed oranges. Pulp has not been in the bottles for decades.\n\nCrush was purchased by Procter & Gamble in 1980 (with the exception of the Canadian rights, which were purchased in 1984). Procter & Gamble only manufactured \"bottler's base,\" which was a concentrate consisting of flavor and color. 1 milliliter of bottler's base was combined with syrup and carbonated water to create a 12-ounce bottle of Crush. In 1989, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Crush USA from Procter & Gamble Co. Cadbury Schweppes spun off its United States beverage business as Keurig Dr Pepper in 2008.\n\nThe Crush brand and trademark are currently owned by Keurig Dr Pepper of Plano, Texas. Crush is also popular in Canada, where it is distributed by subsidiary Canada Dry Motts. It is distributed by various Pepsi bottlers, the biggest being the Pepsi Bottling Group Canada.\n\nOther countries where Crush is sold are Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Guatemala, Lebanon, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Syria, Uruguay and at one time Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Bolivia. In Chile, Crush is distributed by Compañía de Cervecerías Unidas since the 1940's. In contrast, in some countries of Latin America the Crush brand is distributed by The Coca-Cola Company, using the same colors and bottles as Fanta.\n\nSeveral flavors (Orange, Diet Orange, Grape, Strawberry, Cherry) are available at most stores throughout North America; however, others are distributed only within small markets. Pineapple Crush and Birch Beer Crush, for instance, are found in both can and single serving bottle in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in Fort McMurray, Alberta. From 2009, changes in bottling rights allowed many of these regional flavors to be distributed by the Pepsi Bottling Group in a majority of their territory in the United States, and for PepsiAmerica to distribute Crush in most of its territory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "443118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443118", "title": "Dasa", "text": "Dasa\n\nDasa is a Sanskrit language term found in ancient Hindu texts, such as the \"Rigveda\" and \"Arthashastra\". It usually means either \"enemy\" or \"servant\".\n\nA third usage, related to the second, is \"servant of God\", \"devotee,\" \"votary\" or \"one who has surrendered to God\"; \"dasa\" may be a suffix of a given name to indicate a \"servant\" of a revered person or deity.\n\nIn some contexts, \"dasa\" is interchangeable with the Sanskrit words \"dasyu\" and \"asura\". Both of these terms have been translated into other languages as words equivalent to \"demon\", \"harmful supernatural force\", \"slave\", \"servant\" or \"barbarian\", depending on the context in which the word is used.\n\n\"Dāsa\" (Sanskrit: दास) first appears in Vedic texts from the 2nd millennium BCE. There is no consensus on its etymological origins.\n\nKarl Heinrich Tzschucke in 1806, in his translations of the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela, noted etymological and phonological parallels between \"dasa\" and the ethonyms of the Dahae – Persian داها; Sanskrit \"Dasa\"; Latin \"Dahae\"; Greek Δάοι \"Daoi\", Δάαι, Δᾶαι \"Daai\" and Δάσαι \"Dasai\" – a people who lived on the south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea in ancient times (and from whom modern Dehestan/Dehistan takes its name).\n\nMonier Monier-Williams in 1899, stated that the meaning of \"dasa\" varies contextually and means \"mysterious forces\", \"savages\", \"barbarians\" or \"demons\" in the earliest layer of Vedic literature – in other contexts, is a self-effacing way to refer oneself as \"worshipper\" or \"devotee aiming to honor a deity\", or a \"servant of god\". In later Indian literature, according to Monier-Williams, usage of \"dasa\" is used to refer to \"a knowing man, or a knower of the universal spirit\". In the latter sense, \"dāsa\" is masculine, while the feminine equivalent is \"dāsi\". Some early 20th Century translations, such as P. T. Srinivas Iyengar (1912), translate \"dasa\" as \"slave\".\n\nKangle in 1960, and others suggest that, depending on the context, \"dasa\" may be translated as \"enemy\", \"servant\" or \"religious devotee\". More recent scholarly interpretations of the Sanskrit words \"dasa\" or \"dasyu\" suggest that these words used throughout the Vedas represents \"disorder, chaos and dark side of human nature\", and the verses that use the word \"dasa\" mostly contrast it with the concepts of \"order, purity, goodness and light.\" In some contexts, the word \"dasa\" may refer to enemies, in other contexts it may refer to those who had not adopted the Vedic beliefs, and yet other contexts it may refer to mythical enemies in the battle between good and evil.\n\n\"Dasa\" in Buddhist texts can mean \"servant\". In Pali language, it is used as suffix in Buddhist texts, where \"Amaya-dasa\" was translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a \"slave by birth\", \"Kila-dasa\" translated as a \"bought slave\", and \"Amata-dasa\" as \"one who sees Amata (Sanskrit: \"Amrita\", nectar of immortality) or Nibbana\".\n\nAccording to Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, Regarding the Dasas, the question is whether there is any connection between the Azhi-Dahaka of the Zend Avesta. The name Azhi-Dahaka is a compound name which consists of two parts. Azhi means serpent, dragon and Dahaka comes from the root \"Dah\" meaning \"to sting, to do harm\" \n\nMichael Witzel compares the etymological root of \"dasa\" to words from other Indo-European languages that imply \"enemy, foreigner\", including the Avestan \"dahåka\" and \"dŋha\", Latin \"dahi\" and Greek \"daai\".\n\nAsko Parpola in 2015, has proposed that \"dasa\" is related to the ancient Iranian and proto-Saka word \"daha\", which means \"man\". This is contrasted with \"arya\", the word for \"man\" used by, and of, Indo-European people from Central Asia.\n\nBased on the Arya-Dasa conflict described in Rigvedic text, scholars have tried to identify the Dasa as a population in South and Central Asia.\n\nMax Muller proposed that \"dasa\" referred to indigenous peoples living in South Asia before the arrival of the Aryans.\n\nMichael Witzel in his review of Indo-Iranian texts in 1995, states that \"dasa\" in the Vedic literature represented a North Iranian tribe, who were enemies of the Vedic Aryans, and \"das-yu\" meant \"enemy, foreigner.\" He notes that these enemies could have apparently become slaves if captured.\n\nAsko Parpola states that \"dasa\" referred only to Central Asian peoples. Vedic texts that include prayers for the defeat of the \"dasa\" as an \"enemy people\", according to Parpola, possibly refers to people from the so-called Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), who spoke a different language and opposed Aryan religious practices. Parpola uses archaeological and linguistic arguments to support his theory. Among the evidences cited were recent BMAC excavation results where forts in circular shapes were found, the shape described in the early parts of the Rigveda as the enemy forts of Indra. He also found that Rigvedic words starting with triple consonant clusters such as \"Bṛhaspati\", must be loanwords from the unknown BMAC language.\n\nAuthors like Sri Aurobindo believe that words like Dasa are used in the Rig Veda symbolically and should be interpreted spiritually, and that Dasa does not refer to human beings, but rather to demons who hinder the spiritual attainment of the mystic. Many Dasas are purely mythical and can only refer to demons. There is for example a Dasa called Urana with 99 arms (RV II.14.4), and a Dasa with six eyes and three heads in the Rig Veda.\n\nAurobindo commented that in the RV III.34 hymn, where the word Arya varna occurs, Indra is described as the increaser of the thoughts of his followers: \"the shining hue of these thoughts, sukram varnam asam, is evidently the same as that sukra or sveta Aryan hue which is mentioned in verse 9. Indra carries forward or increases the \"colour\" of these thoughts beyond the opposition of the Panis, pra varnam atiracchukram; in doing so he slays the Dasyus and protects or fosters and increases the Aryan \"colour\", hatvi dasyun pra aryam varnam avat.\"\n\nAccording to Aurobindo (The Secret of the Veda), RV 5.14.4 is a key for understanding the character of the Dasyus:\n\nAurobindo explains that in this verse the struggle between light and darkness, truth and falsehood, divine and undivine is described. It is through the shining light created by Agni, god of fire, that the Dasyus, who are identified with the darkness, are slain. The Dasyus are also described in the Rig Veda as intercepting and withholding the Cows, the Waters and Swar (\"heavenly world\"; RV 5.34.9; 8.68.9). It is not difficult, of course, to find very similar metaphors, equating political or military opponents with evil and darkness, even in contemporary propaganda.\n\nK.D. Sethna (1992) writes: \"According to Aurobindo,(...) there are passages in which the spiritual interpretation of the Dasas, Dasyus and Panis is the sole one possible and all others are completely excluded. There are no passages in which we lack a choice either between this interpretation and a nature-poetry or between this interpretation and the reading of human enemies.\"\n\n\"Dasa\" and related words such as \"Dasyu\" are found in the Rig Veda. They have been variously translated, depending on the context. These words represent in some context represent \"disorder, chaos and dark side of human nature\", and the verses that use the word \"dasa\" mostly contrast it with the concepts of \"order, purity, goodness and light.\" In other contexts, the word \"dasa\" refers to enemies and in other contexts, those who had not adopted the Vedic beliefs.\n\nA. A. Macdonell and A. B. Keith in 1912 remarked that, \"The great difference between the Dasyus and the Aryans was their religion... It is significant that constant reference is made to difference in religion between Aryans and Dasa and Dasyu.\"\n\nRig Veda 10.22.8 describes Dasyus as \"savages\" who have no laws, different observances, a-karman (who do not perform rites) and who act against a person without knowing the person.\n\nWithin the Vedic texts, \"Dasa\" is the word used to describe supernatural demonic creatures with many eyes and many heads. This has led scholars to interpret that the word \"Dasa\" in Vedic times meant evil, supernatural, destructive forces. For example, Rigveda in hymn 10.99.6 states,\n\nDasa is also used in Vedic literature, in some contexts, to refer to \"servants\", a few translate this as \"slaves\", but the verses do not describe how the Vedic society treats or mistreats the servants. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is \"dāsa\", and this sense of use is traceable to four verses out of 10,600 verses in Rigveda, namely 1.92.8, 1.158.5, 10.62.10 and 8.56.3. The translation of word \"dasa\" to servant or slave varies by scholars. HH Wilson, for example, translates \"Dasa\" in Rigvedic instances identified by Sharma, as servant rather than slave, as in verse 10.62.10:\n\nR. S. Sharma translates \"dasi\" in a Vedic era Upanishad as \"maid-servant\".\n\nHermann Oldenberg states that no distinction between historical events and mythology existed for the Vedic poets. For them, the conflict between the Aryans and Dasas extended into the realms of gods and demons with the hostile demon being on the same level as the hated and despised savages.\n\nBridget Allchin and Raymond Allchin state that from the Vedas, it is evident that the Indo-Aryans were not the only inhabitants of the region they called \"Sapta-Sindhava\" or land of seven Indus rivers, nor their stay was entirely peaceful. We learn of \"Dasa\" or \"Dasyus\" (a word later meaning \"slave\") who were dark-complexioned, snub-nosed and worshipers of the phallus (śiśna deva). They had abundant cattle and lived in fortified settlements called \"puras\". In addition, we also learn of the Panis who were wealthy in cattle and treasures. Although many hymns refer to conflicts between one Aryan tribe against another, there is an underlying sense of solidarity in conflict against the Dasas and Indra is called \"Purandara\" or \"breaker of cities\". Destruction of many cities by fire is mentioned as is a battle on the banks of Ravi at a place called Hariyūpiyā. Professor Burrow showed the unambiguous character of such references like, \"Through fear of thee the dark-coloured inhabitants fled, not waiting for battle, when, O Agni (fire) burning brightly for Puru (an Aryan tribe), and destroying the cities, thou didst shine.\" (VII, 5, 3) They state he also recognized the importance of terms like \"arma\", \"armaka\", meaning ruin. The Rig Veda states, \"Strike down, O Maghavan (Indra), the host of sorceresses in the ruined city of Vailashthānaka, in the ruined city of Mahāvailastha (Great Vailastha)\" (I, 133, 3). By the end of Mature Vedic period, there were great ruin-mounds which Aryans associated with the earlier inhabitants of the area. A later Vedic text Taittiriya Brahmana states, \"The people to whom these ruined sites belonged, lacking posts, these many settlements, widely distributed, they, O Agni, having been expelled by thee, have emigrated to another land.\" Not all contacts were violent however. the name of the father of Sudas was Divodasa, suggesting the tribal ruler himself belonged to the Dasa stock.\n\nRam Sharan Sharma states that the Rig-Vedic society was primarily organized on basis of tribe, kin and lineage. The \"Aryan\" tribes mentioned by the \"Rig Veda\" therefore may not have been of the same ethnicity, but may have been united by a common language and way of life. He states that while it has been argued that Dasyu and Dasa were not non-Aryans, it is more true in the case of the latter. Further the Dasas are said to be organized into tribes called \"viś\", a term used for Vedic people or tribes. The god Indra is said to be the conqueror of Dasas, who appear mostly human. There are more references to the destruction of Dasyus by Indra instead of Dasas. He is said to have protected the Aryan varna by killing them. The Aryans also fought between themselves. The god Manyu (deity) is invoked to overcome both Aryans and Dasyus. Indra is asked to fight against the godless Dasyus and Aryans, who are the enemies of his followers. (X, 88, 3 & XX, 36, 10).\n\nThe fight between Aryans and their enemies consisted mostly of fortresses and walled settlements of the latter. Both Dasas and Dasyus were in the possession of them. Sharma states that this reminds us of the later discovery of fortifications of Harappan settlements, though there is no clear archaeological evidence of mass-scale confrontation between Aryans and Harappans. He adds that the Aryans seemed to be attracted to their wealth over which a regular warfare took place. The worshiper in the Rig Veda expects that those who offered no oblation should be killed and their wealth be divided (I, 176, 4). However, it was the cattle which held the most importance to Aryans who were cattle-herders. For example, it is argued that Kikatas didn't need cows because they made no use of milk products in sacrifice.\n\nSacrifice played an important part in Aryan way of life, however the Dasyus or Dasas did not offer sacrifices. An entire passage in the seventh book of Rig Veda uses adjectives such as \"akratün\", \"aśraddhān\" and \"ayajñān\" applied to Dasyus emphasizes their non-sacrificing character. Indra is asked to discriminate between them and the sacrificing Aryas. Sharma states that the word \"anindra\" (without Indra) may refer to Dasyus, Dasa and Aryan dissenters. Per the Aryan view, the Dasyus practiced black magic and \"Atharva Veda\" refers to them as evil spirits to be scared away from the sacrifice. The Atharva Veda states that the god-blaspheming Dasyus are to be offered as victims. The Dasyus are believed to be treacherous, not practicing Aryan observances, and are hardly human.\n\nTony Ballantyne states that \"Rig Veda\" depicts the cultural differences between the Aryan invaders and non-Aryans of Indus valley. He states that although the inter-Aryan conflict is prominent in its hymns, a cultural opposition is drawn between Aryans and the indigenous people of North India. According to him, it depicts the indigenous tribes such as the \"Pani\" and \"Dasas\" as godless, savage and untrustworthy. Panis are cattle thieves who seek to deprive Aryans of them. He states Dasas were savages, whose godless society, darker complexion and different language were culturally different from Aryans. They are called barbarians (\"rakshas\"), those without fire (\"anagnitra\") and flesh-eaters (\"kravyad\"). The Aryas were on the other hand presented as noble people protected by their gods Agni and Indra. He adds that their names were extended beyond them to denote savage and barbarian people in general. He concurs that this continued into later Sanskritic tradition where \"dasa\" came to mean a slave while \"Arya\" meant noble.\n\nThe three words Dasa, Dasyu and Asura (danav) are used interchangeably in almost identical verses that are repeated in different Vedic texts, such as the Rig Veda, the Saunaka recension of Atharva veda, the Paippalada Samhita of the Atharva Veda and the Brahmanas text in various Vedas. Such comparative study has led scholars to interpret \"Dasa\" and \"Dasyu\" may have been a synonym of \"Asura\" (demons or evil forces, sometimes simply lords with special knowledge and magical powers) of later Vedic texts.\n\nSharma states that the word \"dasa\" occurs in Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmanas, but not in the sense of a slave.\n\nKautilya's Arthashastra dedicates the thirteenth chapter on \"dasas\", in his third book on law. This Sanskrit document from the Maurya Empire period (4th century BCE), has been translated by several authors. Shamasastry's translation in 1915, Kangle's translation in the 1960s and Rangarajan's translation in 1987 all map \"dasa\" as slave. However, Kangle suggests that the context and rights granted to \"dasa\" by Kautilya, such as the right to the same wage as a free labourer and the right to freedom on payment of an amount, distinguish this form of slavery from that of contemporary Greece. Edmund Leach points out that the Dasa was the antithesis of the concept of \"Arya\". As the latter term evolved through successive meanings, so did Dasa: from \"indigenous inhabitant\" to \"serf,\" \"tied servant,\" and finally \"chattel slave.\" He suggests the term \"unfreedom\" to cover all these meanings.\n\nAccording to Arthashastra, anyone who had been found guilty of \"nishpatitah\" (Sanskrit: निष्पातित, ruined, bankrupt, a minor crime) may mortgage oneself to become \"dasa\" for someone willing to pay his or her bail and employ the \"dasa\" for money and privileges.\n\nAccording to Arthashastra, it was illegal to force a \"dasa\" (slave) to do certain types of work, to hurt or abuse him, or to force sex on a female \"dasa\".\n\nWords related to \"dasa\" are found in early Buddhist texts, such as \"dāso na pabbājetabbo\", which Davids and Stede translate as \"the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu\". This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monk is found in Vinaya Pitakam i.93, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikāya, Tibetan \"Bhiksukarmavakya\" and \"Upasampadajnapti\".\n\nIn Tamil tontai, dasa, servant, commonly used to refer to devotees of Lord Vishnu or Sri Krishna.\n\nIn Gaudiya Vaishnava theology Smriti statement \"\", living entities (bhuto) are eternally in the service (dasa) of the Supreme Lord (Hari). Thus designation for Vaishnava followers of \"svayam bhagavan\" Krishna was the status title \"dasa\" as part of their names as in \"Hari Dasa\".\n\nDasa or Das is also a surname or middle name found among Hindus and Sikhs, typically in northern half of India, where it literally means \"votary, devotee, servant of God.\" For example, Mohandas Gandhi's first name, Mohandas, means servant of Mohan or Krishna. Also, the name Surdas means servant of Sur or Deva. In the past, many saints of the Bhakti movement added it to their names, signifying their total devotion or surrender to God.\n\nDasa and related terms have been examined by several scholars. While the terms \"Dasa\" and \"Dasyu\" have a negative meaning in Sanskrit, their Iranian counterparts \"Daha\" and \"Dahyu\" have preserved their positive (or neutral) meaning. This is similar to the Sanskrit terms \"Deva\" (a \"positive\" term) and \"Asura\" (a \"negative\" term). The Iranian counterparts of these terms (\"Daeva\" and \"Ahura\") have opposite meanings.\n\nAsko Parpola states the original \"Dasa\" is related to the Old Persian word \"Daha\" which also means \"man\", but refers specifically to a regional ethnic minority of Persia. Parpola contrasts \"Daha\" with \"Arya\", stating that the latter also referred to \"man\" but specifically to the incoming Indo-Iranians from Central Asia. The Vedic text that include prayers to help defeat the \"Dasa as enemy people\", states Parpola, may refer to the wars of the Indo-Iranians against the bearers of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) culture. The latter spoke a different language and opposed Indo-Iranian religious practices. Parpola uses archaeological and linguistic arguments to support his theory, but his theory is controversial.\n\n\n\n"}

In Italian, \"macchiato\" means \"stained\" or \"spotted\" so the literal translation of \"caffè macchiato\" is \"stained coffee\", or coffee with a spot of milk.\n\nThe origin of the name \"macchiato\" stems from baristas needing to show the serving waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it; the latter was \"marked\". The idea is reflected in the Portuguese name for the drink: \"café pingado\", meaning \"coffee with a drop\".\n\nThe caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients. The intent is that the milk moderates, rather than overwhelms, the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetness. The drink is typically prepared by pouring a small amount of steamed milk directly into a single shot of espresso. One recipe calls for 5–10 g (1–2 teaspoons) of milk heated to .\n\n"}

The bolo punch is not among the traditional boxing punches (jab, uppercut, hook and cross).\n\n\"Bolo\" is a Filipino word for machete. The primary use for the bolo is clearing vegetation, however the bolo is also used in Filipino martial arts and is one of the main weapons trained in the martial art. After the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War, they took over occupation of the Philippine Islands. Many Filipinos began emigrating to the United States, mostly California and Hawaii, as farm laborers. These immigrants were practitioners of the Filipino martial arts which included the boxing art known as Suntukan, Panantukan, and Pangamot. Many of these Filipino fighters gravitated towards the local sport boxing matches because they could earn more from one boxing match than working a week on the farms. Some used false names and traveled around so they could get around the boxing commission rules and fight more often without any restrictions. They would often use an unorthodox punch that the non-Filipino boxers had never seen before. It became known as the \"bolo punch\" because the movement was similar to swinging a bolo machete when working to cut down crops like sugar cane when working in the fields.\n\nCeferino Garcia is commonly referred to as the inventor of the bolo punch, though a 1924 article appearing in the \"Tacoma News-Tribune\" reported a Filipino boxer named Macario Flores to be using it. Garcia, Kid Gavilán, Sugar Ray Leonard and Pedro Carrasco are widely recognized as some of the best bolo punchers in boxing history. Roy Jones Jr. and Joe Calzaghe also use the bolo punch frequently.\n\nWhen used in boxing, the bolo punch's range of motion is like that of a hook combined with an uppercut. As such, the punch should be thrown at 4–5 o'clock from an orthodox boxer's perspective. Its most important aspect is a circular motion performed with one arm to distract an opponent, causing the opponent to either take his eyes off the attacker's other arm or actually focus on the fighter's circling arm. When the opponent concentrates on the hand that is circling, the bolo puncher will usually sneak in a punch with the opposite hand. When the rival concentrates on the hand that is not moving, the bolo puncher will usually follow through with a full punch.\n\nThree of the most famous cases of a fighter using the bolo punch were when Leonard avenged his loss to Roberto Durán in \"The No Más Fight\", when Leonard drew with Thomas Hearns in their second fight, and when Ike Ibeabuchi knocked out Chris Byrd with a left-handed bolo punch during their 1999 heavyweight contest.\n\n"}

At the end of the meal, the food-soaked trencher was eaten by the diner (from which we get the expression \"trencherman\"), or perhaps fed to a dog or saved for beggars. Trenchers were as much the harbingers of open-face sandwiches as they were of disposable crockery.\n\nA direct precursor to the English sandwich may be found in the Netherlands of the 17th century, where the naturalist John Ray observed that in the taverns beef hung from the rafters \"which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter\". These explanatory specifications reveal the Dutch \"belegd broodje\", open-faced sandwich, was as yet unfamiliar in England.\n\nAn open sandwich is a slice of fresh bread, with different spreads, butter, liver pâté, cheese spreads, cold cuts such as roast beef, turkey, ham, bacon, salami, beef tongue, mortadella, head cheese or sausages like beerwurst or kabanos, and vegetables like bell peppers, tomatoes, radish, scallion and cucumber.\n\nOpen sandwiches like this are consumed in France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland as well as other parts of Europe, and North America as a regular breakfast and supper food item. The American tongue toast is offered as an entrée for breakfast, lunch, and supper and as an hors d'œuvre for formal parties.\n\nIn former Czechoslovakia a popular type of open sandwich is called \"obložené chlebíčky\" (pl., sg. \"obložený chlebíček\") - slant ways cut slice of \"veka\" (long narrow white bread) spread with butter and/or with various combinations of mayonnaise salads and hard boiled egg, cheese, ham, salami, smoked fish (salmon or sprats or pickled herring), tomato, pickled cucumber, lettuce, raw onion or other vegetable, etc.\n\nOpen sandwich is the common, traditional sandwich type in the Nordic countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, where it is typically eaten at breakfast, lunch, supper, or as a snack. In Finland the sandwich is called \"voileipä\", and in Estonia similarly \"võileib\", which also means \"butter bread\".\n\nThe Scandinavian open sandwich (, , or \"macka\") consists of one piece of buttered bread, often whole-grain rye bread (, , ), topped with, for instance, cheese, cold steak, ham, turkey, shrimps, smoked salmon, caviar, hard boiled eggs, bacon, herring, fish fillets, liver pâté (, ), and/or small meatballs. This is typically complemented by some herbs and vegetables such as parsley, cold salad, thinly sliced cucumber, tomato wedges and/or pickled beets etc. on the same slice of bread.\n\nA condiment, such as mayonnaise, or mayonnaise-based dressing is also often included in some form.\nAn old traditional replacement for butter on a piece of bread with herring is pig fat. There are many variations associated with the smørrebrød/smørbrød/smörgås and there are even special stores, cafés and restaurants (especially in Denmark) that specialize in them.\n\nThe Dutch and Flemish \"Uitsmijter\" consists of one or more slices of bread topped with fried eggs (one per slice of bread), and can be accompanied by slices of cheese and/or meat (roast beef or ham). The dish is often served as a hearty breakfast. Sweet toppings are commonly used for breakfast in the Netherlands and Belgium: e.g. sprinkles, vlokken, or muisjes, next to the more widespread peanut butter, honey, jam, and chocolate spread.\n\nIn Great Britain, open sandwiches are rare outside of Scandinavian delicatessens. Instead, there is \"on toast\" (e.g., cheese on toast). However, this is not considered a sandwich . The open sandwiches found in Great Britain are the Welsh rarebit and the Scotch woodcock, an open sandwich served historically at the colleges of the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford and in the refreshment rooms of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as late as 1949.\n\nIn North America an \"open faced sandwich\" may also refer to a slice of bread topped with warm slices of roasted meat and gravy. Examples include a beef Manhattan, a hot chicken sandwich in Canada, or Welsh rarebit. This is also done in Scandinavian countries, where they also eat open faced sandwiches with fried meat and fried fish.\n\n"}

The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.\n\nPasta and cheese casseroles have been recorded as early as the 14th century in the Italian cookbook, \"Liber de Coquina\", one of the oldest medieval cookbooks, which featured a dish of parmesan and pasta. A cheese and pasta casserole known as \"makerouns\" was recorded in the famous medieval English cookbook, the \"Forme of Cury\", which was also written in the 14th century. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese. The recipe given (in Middle English) was:\n\nThis is the above recipe in modern English: \n\nThe first modern recipe for macaroni and cheese was included in Elizabeth Raffald's 1770 book, \"The Experienced English Housekeeper\". Raffald's recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked until bubbly and golden. Another recipe from 1784 stated that the small tubes of macaroni must be boiled, then drained in a sifter before being moved to a frying pan. Heavy cream is then added to the macaroni along with a \"knob of butter\" rolled in flour, and it must be cooked for five minutes before being transferred to a dish and topped with toasted Parmesan and pepper. The famous British Victorian cookbook \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" included two macaroni and cheese recipes. One of them states: \n\nIn the United Kingdom, during the 2010s, it has seen a surge in popularity, becoming widespread as a meal and as a side order in both fast food and upmarket restaurants.\n\nThe American president Thomas Jefferson and James Hemings, his chef and slave, encountered macaroni in Paris and brought the recipe back to Monticello. Jefferson drew a sketch of the pasta and wrote detailed notes on the extrusion process. In 1793, he commissioned American ambassador to Paris William Short to purchase a machine for making it. Evidently, the machine was not suitable, as Jefferson later imported both macaroni and Parmesan cheese for his use at Monticello. In 1802, Jefferson served \"a pie called macaroni\" at a state dinner. The menu of the dinner was reported by Reverend Manasseh Cutler, who apparently was not fond of the cheesy macaroni casserole. Nevertheless, since that time, baked macaroni and cheese has remained popular in the United States.\nA recipe called \"macaroni and cheese\" appeared in the 1824 cookbook \"The Virginia Housewife\" written by Mary Randolph. Randolph's recipe had three ingredients: macaroni, cheese, and butter, layered together and baked in a hot oven. The cookbook was the most influential cookbook of the 19th century, according to culinary historian Karen Hess. Similar recipes for macaroni and cheese occur in the 1852 \"Hand-book of Useful Arts\", and the 1861 \"Godey's Lady's Book\". By the mid-1880s, cookbooks as far west as Kansas and Festus, Missouri, included recipes for macaroni and cheese casseroles. Factory production of the main ingredients made the dish affordable, and recipes made it accessible, but not notably popular. As it became accessible to a broader section of society, macaroni and cheese lost its upper class appeal.\n\nMacaroni and Cheese was brought to Canada by British immigrants, coming from other parts of the British Empire. Macaroni and cheese recipes have been attested in Canada since at least \"Modern Practical Cookery\" in 1845, which suggests a puff pastry lining (suggesting upper-class refinement); a sauce of cream, egg yolks, mace, and mustard; and grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese on top. Canadian Cheddar cheese was also becoming popularized at this time and was likely also used during that era.\n\nMacaroni and cheese is very popular in modern-day Canada. Kraft Dinner is the most popular brand of packaged macaroni and cheese. Sasha Chapman, writing in \"The Walrus\", considered it to be Canada's national dish, ahead of poutine.\n\nPasta other than macaroni noodles are often used: most any short-cut extruded pasta and many of the decorative cut pasta will do, particularly those with folds and pockets to hold the cheese. The dish may still be referred to as \"macaroni and cheese\" when made with a different pasta; while \"shells and cheese\" is sometimes used when it is made with Conchiglie.\n\nWhile Cheddar cheese is most commonly used for macaroni and cheese, other cheeses may also be used—usually sharp in flavor—and two or more cheeses can be combined. Popular recipes include using Gruyere, Gouda, Havarti, and Parmesan cheese.\n\nMacaroni and cheese can be made by simply layering slices of cheese and pasta (often with butter and/or evaporated milk) then baking in a casserole, rather than preparing as a cheese sauce. Also, some like to include a crunchy topping to their baked macaroni and cheese by topping it off with bread crumbs or crushed crackers, which also keeps the noodles on top from drying out when baking.\nOne novelty presentation is deep-fried macaroni and cheese found at fairs and food carts. In Scotland, macaroni and cheese can often be found incorporated into a pastry shell, known as a macaroni pie. Macaroni and cheese pizza can be found on recipe web sites and US restaurant menus, such as Cici's Pizza.\n\nA similar traditional dish in Switzerland is called (Alpine herder's macaroni), which is also available in boxed versions. \"Älplermagronen\" are made of macaroni, cream, cheese, roasted onions, and in some recipes, potatoes. In the Canton of Uri, the potatoes are traditionally omitted, and in some regions, bacon or ham is added. The cheese is often Emmental cheese or Appenzeller cheese. It is usually accompanied by apple sauce.\n\nExtra ingredients sometimes incorporated include bacon, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, leeks, dried herbs, Tabasco sauce, sautéed mushrooms, ham, ground beef, sliced hot dogs, Spam, lobster, canned tuna or salmon, peas and broccoli.\n\nPackaged macaroni and cheese is available in frozen form or as boxed ingredients for simplified preparation. Boston Market, Michelina's, Kraft, and Stouffer's are some of the more recognizable brands of prepared and frozen macaroni and cheese available in the United States. \"Macaroni and cheese loaf\" can be found in some stores.\n\nA variety of packaged mixes which are prepared in a sauce pan on the stove or in a microwave oven are available. They are usually modeled on Kraft Macaroni & Cheese (known as Kraft Dinner in Canada), which was introduced in 1937 with the slogan \"make a meal for four in nine minutes.\" It was an immediate success in the US and Canada amidst the economic hardships of the Depression. During the Second World War, rationing led to increased popularity for the product which could be obtained two boxes for one food rationing stamp. The 1953 \"Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook\" includes a recipe using Velveeta, which had been reformulated in that year. The boxed Kraft product is immensely popular in Canada, where it is the most-purchased grocery item in the country.\n\nBoxed mixes consist of uncooked pasta and either a liquid cheese sauce (often labeled \"deluxe\") or powdered ingredients to prepare it. The powdered cheese sauce is mixed with either milk or water, and margarine, butter, or olive oil and added to the cooked noodles. Some mixes prepared in a microwave cook the pasta in the sauce.\n\nAnother popular variant is jarred macaroni cheese sauce, which is especially popular in the UK and US, available under the Dolmio and Ragú brands, among others. The pasta is purchased and prepared separately, then mixed with the heated cheese sauce.\n\nPowdered cheese sauce, very similar to what is found inside a box of macaroni and cheese mix, is also sold separately without the pasta. This product is produced by several companies, most notably Bisto, Cabot, Annie's and Kraft.\n\nA number of different products on the market use this basic formulation with minor variations in ingredients.\n\n"}

Generally, it is used to denote the sacred ash which is made of burnt dried wood in Āgamic rituals. Hindu devotees apply vibhuti traditionally as three horizontal lines across the forehead and other parts of the body to honor Shiva. Vibhuti smeared across the forehead to the end of both eyebrows is called Tripundra. According to the MahaShiva Purana the particles of ash which cling to the skin when tripundra is applied are to be considered as individual Lingams. The scriptures further state that bhasma purifies the soul, elevates the devotee of Shiva and works done without wearing Bhasma are infructuous. There are various methods for the application of the ashes according to the purana and various mantras to be recited during application. \nAnother meaning of vibhuti is a 'glorious form', in contrast with Avatar, a reincarnation of Brahman. Bhagavata Theology describes a vibhuti as 'incarnation of power', which is only a temporary occasional manifestation such as when holy men are infused with divine virtues and qualities are infused. Aurobindo mentions a vibhuti as 'the hero of a race's struggle towards divine achievement, the hero in the Carlylean sense of heroism, a power of God in man.'\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "447351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447351", "title": "Capital good", "text": "Capital good\n\nA capital good (also called complex products and systems or (CoPS)) is a durable good that is used in the production of goods or services. Capital goods are one of the three types of producer goods, the other two being land and labour. The three are also known collectively as \"primary factors of production\"\n\nThis classification originated during the classical economics period and has remained the dominant method for classification.\n\nMany definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature. Capital goods are generally considered one-of-a-kind, capital intensive products that consist of many components. They are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves.\n\nExamples include automated storage and retrieval systems, automatic test equipment, battleships, baggage handling systems, data centers, oil rigs, roller coaster equipment, semiconductor fabrication plants, and wind turbines. Their production is often organized in projects, with several parties cooperating in networks (Hicks et al. 2000; Hicks and McGovern 2009; Hobday 1998). \nA capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering, engineering and procurement, manufacturing, commissioning, maintenance and (sometimes) decommissioning . \n\nIn terms of economics, capital goods are tangible property. A society acquires capital goods by saving wealth that can be invested in the means of production. People use them to produce other goods or services within a certain period. Machinery, tools, buildings, computers, or other kinds of equipment that are involved in production of other things for sale are capital goods. The owners of the capital good can be individuals, households, corporations or governments. Any material used to produce capital goods is also considered a capital good.\n\nPeople buy capital goods to use as static resources to make other goods, whereas consumer goods are purchased to be consumed. \n\nFor example, an automobile is a consumer good when purchased as a private car.\n\nDump trucks used in manufacturing or construction are production goods, because companies use them to build things like roads, dams, buildings, and bridges. \n\nIn the same way, a chocolate bar is a consumer good, but the machines that produce the candy are production goods. \n\nSome capital goods can be used in both production of consumer goods or production goods, such as machinery for production of dump trucks.\n\nConsumption is the logical result of all economic activity, but the level of future consumption depends on the future capital stock, and this in turn depends on the current level of production in the capital-goods sector. Hence if there is a desire to increase the consumption, the output of the capital goods should be maximized. \n\nCapital goods, often called complex products and systems (CoPS) (Gann and Salter 2000; Hobday 2000), play an important role in today’s economy (Acha et al. 2004). Aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers, capital goods are important in other ways. In an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive, they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies. If a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product, for example, it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market. Such a company might turn to another business to supply its products, but this can be expensive as well. This means that, in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a business's start up costs, the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small. \n\nThe acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company. When a business is struggling, it often puts off such purchases as long as possible, since it does not make sense to spend money on equipment if the company is not around to use it. Capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products, a potentially positive economic sign. \nIn most cases, capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer, and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense. These goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as producers' goods, production goods or means of production.\n\nIn the theory of the international trade the causes and nature of trade of capital goods receive little attention. Trade in capital goods is a crucial part of the dynamic relationship between international trade and development. The production and trade of capital goods as well as consumer goods must be introduced to trade models, and the entire analysis integrated with domestic capital accumulation theory.\n\n"}

Traditionally made from mutton or lamb, but has also been associated with wild game, deer and venison mostly, and even cubed beef steak depending on preparation.\n\nThe word \"chislic\" is arguably derived from the Turkic word of shashlik or shashlyk, which is cubed meat or liver grilled on a skewer with tomatoes, peppers, and onions. The origin of the word shashlyk is rooted in shish kebab, the Turkish and Arabic words for skewered meats. According to some sources, chislic was possibly introduced into the United States by John Hoellwarth, who immigrated from Crimea to Hutchinson County, South Dakota in the 1870s.\n\nChislic is traditionally prepared very simply. Cubed mutton or lamb (or alternately beef or venison), generally no bigger than a half-inch, are cooked in a deep fryer. Generally, chislic is served medium-rare to medium—i.e. warm pink inside. After cooking, while the meat cools on a paper towel, it is flavored with garlic salt, or other varieties of seasoned salts. The cubes are eaten hot, using toothpicks.\n\nChislic may vary slightly in preparation from region to region.\n\nIn the southeastern South Dakota communities of Freeman and Menno chislic is generally prepared deep-fried in restaurants. The meat is almost invariably lamb, but wild game chislic, such as venison, may appear when in season. It is traditionally seasoned with garlic salt and eaten with soda crackers. The small, blunt skewer - or sometimes a toothpick – usually holds five or six cubes of meat. The same dish is also served grilled when prepared for large groups, such as gatherings at community organization fund-raisers or baseball games during the Fourth of July. The grilled variety is sometimes cooked with a brushing of barbecue sauce.\n\nAnnually in Freeman, at the heart of the Chislic Circle, the South Dakota Chislic Festival is held. Chislic can be found in Scotland, as well as other southeastern South Dakota towns. The local bars sometimes hold chislic feasts where more than a dozen sticks of chislic may be consumed.\n\nIn the Brookings area, chislic is deep-fried mutton. In more recent times, it has been common to prepare chislic using lamb meat, which is typically more tender and approachable in flavor. In keeping with tradition, it is seasoned with garlic salt and served with soda crackers and bleu cheese dressing (hot sauce optional). It is thought of as casual bar, café, or family-function fare and is usually eaten using toothpicks and paired with beer. Other innovations or variations of chislic are specified, i.e. \"beef chislic.\" \n\nIn the Pierre area, chislic is a marinated meat, dipped in batter and deep-fat fried. It has been offered as an alternative to Rocky Mountain oysters. The marinades vary and are often family secrets. \n\nIn the Sioux Falls area, chislic, usually deep fried mutton, is a popular bar food to accompany cold beer. It is often served with garlic salt, soda crackers and hot sauce.\n\nIn the Watertown area, chislic, usually deep fried beef, is found on most appetizer menus. Most often served with a side of Ranch dressing.\n\nIn the Redfield area, chislic is deep fried beef with a side of toast and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.\n\nIn Omaha, former South Dakota residents have developed a southern variation using a combination of taco seasoning, cayenne pepper and garlic. The southern style dish has been served in appetizer form at the Annual Omaha Police Officers Association Gala since 2014.\n\n"}

His son, Curt Mast (1897-1970), was passionate about the production of spirits and liqueurs, and always keen to help his father in the business even at an early age. At the age of 37, after he successfully took over his father's business, Curt Mast finally came up with the recipe for his new herbal liqueur, which he called \"Jägermeister\", in 1934.\n\n, the original distiller of and son of the founder , was an enthusiastic hunter. The name \"Jägermeister\" in German literally means \"Hunter Master\", \"Hunt Master\" or \"master of the hunt\". It is a title for a high-ranking official in charge of matters related to hunting and gamekeeping. The term ' had existed as a job title for many centuries.

It is akin to other European liqueurs, such as from Denmark, balsam and from Moldova, from the Netherlands, from Hungary, from the Czech Republic, Gorzka Żołądkowa from Poland, from Slovakia, from Croatia, Riga Black Balsam from Latvia, from Serbia, from Italy and and from France. In contrast to those beverages, has a sweeter taste. In Germany itself, there are quite a few competitors, such as , , , , , and , some of which are as sweet as Jägermeister.\n\n's ingredients include 56 herbs, fruits, roots, and spices, including citrus peel, licorice, anise, poppy seeds, saffron, ginger, juniper berries, and ginseng. These ingredients are ground, then steeped in water and alcohol for 2–3 days. Afterwards, this mixture is filtered and stored in oak barrels for about a year. When a year has passed, the liqueur is filtered again, then mixed with sugar, caramel, and alcohol.\n\nThe company recommends that be kept on ice and served cold, and suggests that it be kept in a freezer at −18 °C (0 °F) or on tap between .\n\nContrary to a rumor that has circulated on the internet, does not contain deer blood or elk blood.\n\nThe label on Jägermeister bottles features a glowing Christian cross seen between the antlers of a stag.

The organs are often deep-fried after being peeled, coated in flour, pepper and salt, and sometimes pounded flat. This delicacy is most often served as an appetizer.\n\nThe dish is served in parts of Canada, where cattle ranching is prevalent and castration of young male animals is common. \"Prairie oysters\" is the preferred name in Canada where they are served in a demi-glace. In Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, they are often called calf fries. In Spain, Argentina and many parts of Mexico they are referred to as \"criadillas\", and they are colloquially referred to as \"huevos de toro\" (literally, \"bull’s eggs\"; besides its literal meaning, \"huevos\" is a Spanish slang term for testicles) in Central and South America. Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes confused with cattle fries or animelles (cattle testicles), which are served in a similar manner. A few other terms, such as \"cowboy caviar\", \"Montana tendergroins\", \"dusted nuts\", \"swinging beef\", or simply “mountain oysters” may be used.\n\nThe dish, purportedly cowboy fare, is most commonly found served at festivals, amongst ranching families, or at certain specialty eating establishments and bars. They are, however, also readily available at some public venues (e.g., at Coors Field during Colorado Rockies baseball games). Eagle, Idaho, claims to have the \"World's Largest Rocky Mountain Oyster Feed\" during its Eagle Fun Days (now held the second weekend in July). Clinton, Montana, Deerfield, Michigan, Huntley, Illinois, Olean, Missouri, Severance, Colorado, and Tiro, Ohio also hold testicle festivals. Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes served as a prank to those unaware of the origin of these \"oysters\". They are also considered to be an aphrodisiac by many people.\n\nThe primary goal of testicle removal is not culinary. Castration in veterinary practice and animal husbandry is common and serves a variety of purposes, including the control of breeding, the growth of skeletal muscle suitable for beef, and temperament alteration.\n\nTesticles from other animals can also be used in similar dishes. The most common is lamb fries (not to be confused with lamb's fry which is another term for liver of lamb) made with testicles from castrated sheep. In some cases, pig testicles are used as well to make \"pig fries\".\n\nAnother dish found on occasion is turkey fries made from turkey testes.

Marzipan can also be made from oatmeal, farina, or semolina.\nIn Iran, marzipan fruit is a traditional Passover treat, replacing biscuits and cakes.\n\nIn Latin American cuisine, marzipan was brought from Spain and is known by the \"Castilian\" (Spanish) word \"mazapán\" and is also traditionally eaten at Christmas, although Latin American \"mazapán\" is generally made with peanuts in place of almonds as the Spanish \"mazapán\".\n\nIn the Indian state of Goa, marzipan (\") was introduced from Portugal. However, the Goan version uses cashew nuts instead of almonds. Goan marzipan is used to make Easter eggs. It is also used to make Christmas sweets in various shapes like fruits, flowers, stars, etc. Similarly, in the city of Bombay(Mumbai), the East Indians mould their cashewnut-based or almond-based marzipan into different shapes for Christmas and into marzipan eggs, chickens and bonnets for Easter.\n\nIn the Philippines marzipan was brought from Spain, \" (Spanish for \"pili marzipan\") is made from pili nuts.\n\nThere are two proposed lines of origin for marzipan; they are not necessarily contradictory and may be complementary, as there have always been Mediterranean trade and cooking influences. Other sources establish the origin of marzipan in China, from where the recipe moved on to the Middle East and then to Europe through Al-Andalus.\n\nAlthough it is believed to have been introduced to Eastern Europe through the Turks (\"badem ezmesi\" in Turkish, and most notably produced in Edirne), there is some dispute between Hungary and Italy over its origin. In Sicily it was (1193) known as \"panis martius\" or \"marzapane\", \"i.e.\", March Bread. Marzipan became a specialty of the Hanseatic League port towns. In particular, the cities of Lübeck and Tallinn have a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture. Examples include Lübecker Marzipan (\"PGI\"). The city's manufacturers like Niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two-thirds almonds by weight, which results in a product of highest quality. Historically, the city of Königsberg in East Prussia was also renowned for its distinctive marzipan production. Königsberg marzipan remains a special type of marzipan in Germany that is golden brown on its surface and sometimes embedded with marmalade at its centre.\n\nAnother possible geographic origin is in Spain, then known as Al-Andalus. In Toledo (850-900, though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII) this specialty was known as \"Postre Regio\" (instead of \"Mazapán\") and there are also mentions in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac.\nMazapán is Toledo's most famous dessert, often created for Christmas, and has PGI status. Almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight, following the directives of \"Mazapán de Toledo\" regulator counseil.\nAnother idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery, the \"turrón\".\n\nIn the U.S., marzipan is not officially defined, but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste. One brand, for instance, has 28% almonds in its marzipan, and 45% almonds in its almond paste. However, in Sweden and Finland almond paste refers to a marzipan that contains 50% ground almonds, a much higher quality than regular marzipan. In Germany, Lübecker Marzipan is known for its quality. It contains 66% almonds. The original manually produced Mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio marzipan.\n\nPersipan is a similar, yet less expensive product, in which the almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. To control and detect the authenticity of marzipan, polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations less than 1%. German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French marzipan (called 'massepain') is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some marzipan is flavoured with rosewater. Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds. In the U.S, bitter almonds are not used in marzipan because the importation of bitter almonds into the U.S. is prohibited by U.S. law, owing to them containing a substance related to cyanide. Sugar free marzipan can be made by replacing sugar with polyols such as maltitol.\n\nThe German name has largely ousted the original English name \"marchpane\" with the same apparent derivation: \"March bread\". (The word \"marchpane\" occurs in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", Act 1, Scene 5, Line 9.) \"Marzapane\" is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language, and the sense \"bread\" for \"pan\" is Romance. The origin could be from the Latin term \"martius panis\", which means \"bread of March\". However, the ultimate etymology is unclear; for example, the Italian word derives from the Latin words \"Massa\" (itself from Greek Μάζα \"Maza\") meaning pastry and \"Pan\" meaning bread, this can be particularly seen in the Provençal \"massapan\", the Portuguese \"maçapão\" (where 'ç' is an alternative form for the phoneme 'ss') and old Spanish \"mazapán\" – the change from 'ss' to 'z' in Latin words was common in old Spanish and the 'r' appeared later. It could also be derived from martis pan, bread of March. Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary, one theory proposes that the word \"marzipan\" may be a corruption of Martaban, a Burmese city famous for its jars.\n\nThe Real Academia Española suggests the idea of the Spanish word mazapán to be derived from the Hispanic Arabic بسمة pičmáṭ, which is derived from the Greek παξαμάδιον.\nAnother source could be from Arabic موثابان \"mawthābān\" \"king who sits still\". The Arabic, Latinised as \"matapanus\", was used to describe a Venetian coin depicting an enthroned Christ the King. These coins were stored in ornate boxes. From about the fifteenth century, when the coins were no longer in circulation, the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats. One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavoured marzipan, named (at least proximately) after the box in which it was stored.\n\nHowever, if marzipan has its origin in Persia, it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban (in Persian: مرزبان, derived from the words Marz مرز meaning \"border\" or \"boundary\" and the suffix -bān بان meaning guardian), a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia (Iran) between the 3rd and 7th centuries.\n\nTo produce marzipan, raw almonds are cleaned \"by sieving, air elutriation, and other electronic or mechanical devices\", then immersed in water with a temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes, in a process known as blanching. This loosens the almonds' skin, which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders. This process reduces hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentration and increases water content. They are then cooled, after which they are coarsely chopped and ground, with up to 35% sugar, into almond flour.\n\nThe almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled, after which sucrose (table sugar) and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added. It may then be moulded into any shape. Marzipan must be covered in an airtight container to prevent it from hardening and dehydrating. It should be protected from direct light to prevent rancidity of almond oil, a result of lipid oxidation.\n\nThe aroma and flavor of marzipan can partially be attributed to benzaldehyde, which is found naturally in almonds.\n\nMarzipan is a food emulsion that contains 4 phases: a solid phase of suspended particles including almonds and sugars, a suspended air pocket phase formed from incorporated air during mixing, a water phase, and a lipid phase from almond oil. The phases can separate when left alone for long periods of time. It is stabilized by the phospholipids and triglycerides found in the almond cells. The fatty acids found in almonds include saturated fats such as stearic acid and unsaturated fats such as linoleic acid. Emulsifiers can be added during production to increase shelf life.\n\nMarzipan's softness is a balance between the solid and liquid components. It should have a moisture content of less than 10%.\n\n\n"}

PepsiCo responded within one hour, announcing the introduction of Pepsi One (which reached store shelves the following October). The original formulation was sweetened with aspartame and acesulfame potassium. This new variety was based upon an earlier product (sold in other countries) called Pepsi Max, but it featured a formula and flavor profile developed specifically for the U.S. market.\n\nThe launch of Pepsi One included an advertising campaign featuring the slogan \"just one calorie.\" Subsequently, comedian Tom Green appeared as the spokesperson in a series of television advertisements that began airing in April 1999.\n\nBefore 2012, Pepsi One was the last Pepsi variant to include the old logo used from 2003 to 2008, while all the other Pepsi variants had been using the current logo used since late 2008; the only other Pepsi product not using the current logo was Pepsi Throwback, which intentionally used retro packaging. However, Pepsi One's logo was later modernized with the current logo to be in line with the other flavors.\n\nOn March 21, 2005, Pepsi-Cola North America announced that it would begin adding sucralose to a newly reformulated Pepsi ONE in order to create a full-flavor cola taste.\n\nIn January 2014, Consumer Reports magazine tested levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole (4-MeI) -- a potential carcinogen -- in various beverages in the United States and found that Pepsi ONE was one of two drinks that contained the chemical in excess of 29 micrograms per can or bottle, with that being California Proposition 65's daily allowed amount for foods without a warning label.\n\nIn mid-2015, after its sister product Diet Pepsi had changed to using sucralose and Ace-K as sweeteners instead of aspartame, Pepsi One was discontinued. PepsiCo wrote on its website that \"Pepsi ONE has been discontinued. We regularly evaluate our product portfolio to find efficiencies, and we have decided to remove Pepsi ONE from the marketplace. Pepsi ONE has very limited distribution and will be out of the marketplace by start of the year 2015, and in some markets product inventory has already been exhausted.\"\n\nFrom its introduction in 1964 and until 1991, Diet Pepsi was also marketed as having one calorie per serving.\n\nOn April 7, 2010, it was announced that Pepsi One would be the title sponsor of Toyota Speedway at Irwindale's Super Late Models, the track's top division. The series will be called the NASCAR Pepsi One Super Late Models.\n\n\n\n"}
