It is a bitters, characterised by its dark red colour.\n\nCampari is often used in cocktails and is commonly served with soda water or citrus juice, or with prosecco as a spritz. It is produced by the Davide Campari Group, a multi-national company based in Italy.\n\nCampari was invented in 1860 by Gaspare Campari in Novara, Italy. It was originally coloured with carmine dye, derived from crushed cochineal insects, which gave the drink its distinctive red colour.\n\nIn 1904, Campari's first production plant was opened in Sesto San Giovanni, near Milan, Italy. Under the direction of Davide Campari, Gaspare's son, the company began to export the beverage, first to Nice in the heart of the French Riviera, then overseas. The Campari brand is now distributed in over 190 countries.\n\nIn the Italian market, Campari mixed with soda water is sold in individual bottles as Campari Soda (10% alcohol by volume). Campari Soda is packaged in a distinctive bottle that was designed by Fortunato Depero in 1932.\n\nCampari is an essential ingredient in the classic Negroni cocktail, the Garibaldi cocktail, the Americano (which was named at a time when few Americans were aware of Campari), and the spritz (an aperitif popular in northern Italy).\n\nIt is a chief component of the Clint cocktail, named for the iconic American Secret Service agent who not only protected five Presidents, but shielded Jackie Kennedy with his own body within seconds after President Kennedy was shot.\n\n\"Wine Enthusiast\" has reviewed Campari on a number of occasions, most recently giving it a score of \"96–100\" in 2011.

There are different versions in Japan, Korea and China. The dish was inspired by the cuisine of China. \"Champon\" is made by frying pork, seafood and vegetables with lard; a soup made with chicken and pig bones is then added. Ramen noodles made especially for \"champon\" are added and then boiled. Unlike other ramen dishes, only one pan is needed as the noodles are boiled in the soup. Depending on the season and the situation, the ingredients differ. Hence the taste and style may depend on the location and time of year.\n\nAlthough Nagasaki Champon is the most well-known rendition, there are other variations found in Japan. \"Ankake no Champon\" is a soy-sauce based variant found in Tottori, Shimane Prefectures, as well as the city of Amagasaki in Hyōgo Prefecture. In the city of Akita, a version with miso broth is served, with the soup filling to the bowl almost to the point of overflowing.\n\nIn Okinawa, Champon is a rice dish where assorted vegetables, thinly-sliced meat (pork, luncheon meat or corned beef hash) and scrambled egg are fried and served on top of rice.\nThe Korean Jjamppong is a similar noodle dish with a spicy seafood broth.\n\n\"Champon\" was first served by , a Chinese restaurant in Nagasaki. According to the restaurant, it was based on a dish in Fujian cuisine, . In the middle of the Meiji period, the owner saw a need for a cheap, filling meal that suited the palates of hundreds of Chinese students who came to Japan for school. Nowadays, \"champon\" is a popular specialty food (or \"meibutsu\") of Nagasaki.\n\nThere are several theories as to the origin of the word \"champon.\" Its current definition is \"to mix a variety of things.\" One theory is that it was derived from the Hokkien word \"chia̍h-pn̄g\" (食飯), which means \"to eat a meal\". Another theory is that the word was derived from the word \"campur\" Malay or Indonesian, meaning mixed (see Nasi campur).\n\n"}

{"id": "1044243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1044243", "title": "Butter tart", "text": "Butter tart\n\nA butter tart is a type of small pastry tart highly regarded in Canadian cuisine and considered one of Canada's quintessential treats. The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg, baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart should not be confused with butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.\n\nRecipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.\n\nTraditionally, the English Canadian tart consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian sugar pie, or the base of the U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from the sugar pie given the lack of flour in the filling. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a \"runnier\" filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often raisins, walnuts or pecans are added to the traditional butter tart. However purists contend that such additions should not be allowed.\n\nMore exotic flavours are also produced by some bakers. Examples such as maple, bacon, pumpkin, chili and salted caramel cardamom flavours have been made for competitions.\n\nButter tarts were common in pioneer Canadian cooking, and they remain a characteristic pastry of Canada, considered a recipe of genuinely Canadian origin. It is primarily eaten in and associated with the English-speaking provinces of Canada.\n\nThe butter tart is a derivative of one or more of the following:\n\nThe earliest published Canadian recipe is from Barrie, Ontario, dating back to 1900 and can be found in The Women's Auxiliary of the Royal Victoria Hospital Cookbook, to which a Mrs. Mary Ethel MacLeod submitted the recipe for a butter tart filling. The original cookbook and recipe is housed at the Simcoe County Archives. Another early publication of a butter tart recipe was found in a 1915 pie cookbook. The food was an integral part of early Canadian cuisine and often viewed as a source of pride.\n\nSimilar tarts are made in Scotland, where they are often referred to as \"Ecclefechan butter tarts\" from the town of Ecclefechan. In France, they are related to the much more common \"\", that differs from the basic Canadian recipe only by the addition of ground almonds.\n\nButter tarts are an integral part of Eastern Canadian cuisine and are objects of cultural pride of many communities across Ontario and indeed Canada. This cultural and community connection with the tart has spawned butter tart themed tourism such as the Butter Tart festival at Muskoka Lakes, Ontario, the trademarked \"Butter Tart Trail\" at Wellington North, Ontario, and the \"Butter Tart Tour\" in Kawarthas Northumberland, Ontario. The two competing associations have since resolved their dispute through the mutual agreement to modify \"The Butter Tart Tour\" to \"Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour\". The first Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour Taste-Off was launched at the Flavour Festival in Peterborough on Sunday, April 28, 2013, where four bakeries were crowned winners by a panel of celebrity judges.\n\nOntario's Best Butter Tart Festival and Contest is an annual event held in Midland, Ontario. The contest portion of the festival attracts bakers from across Ontario, and is Canada's largest butter tart–themed celebration, with over 50,000 tarts sold in the festival market in 2014.\n\n\"National Geographic\" recognized the significance of the butter tart in an article on Georgian Bay, Ontario. In October 2013, referring to a stand in Wasaga Beach, they stated that \"It's the homemade Canadian butter tarts – flaky crust with gooey pecan filling – that set this place apart from other lakeside ice cream stands.\" \n\nA New York Times article, \"Butter Tarts, Canada's Humble Favorite, Have Much to Love\", was published in January 2018 and went viral, with non-Canadians discovering butter tarts for the first time. This sparked a series of articles, videos, and other media pertaining to the butter tart, including Passions of the Butter Tart, and the \"Eaton's All The Butter Tarts\" episode of the Fashionably Ate podcast.\n\n\n"}

It is commonplace in traditional Scottish breakfasts.\n\nThe exact origins of the lorne sausage remain unclear. It is often eaten in the Scottish variant of the full breakfast or in a breakfast roll. The sausage is also an appropriate size to make a sandwich using one or two slices from a plain loaf of bread.\n\nSausage meat, in this case a mixture of pork and beef, is minced with rusk and spices, packed into a rectangular tin with a cross-section of about 10 cm square, and sliced about 1 cm thick before cooking. Square sausage has no casing, unlike traditional sausages, and must be tightly packed into the mould to hold it together; slices are often not truly square.\n\nIt is thought that \"Lorne sausage\" is named after the region of Lorne in Argyll; advertisements for 'Lorne Sausage' have been found in newspapers as early as 1896. This was long before comedian Tommy Lorne, after whom the sausage has been said to be named, became well-known.\n\n"}

Speculaas are thin, very crunchy, caramelized, slightly browned and, most significantly, have some image or figure (often from the traditional stories about St. Nicholas) stamped on the front side before baking; the back is flat.\n\nSpeculaas dough does not rise much. Dutch and Belgian versions are baked with light brown (sometimes beet) sugar and baking powder. German uses baker's ammonia as leavening agent. Indian, Indonesian, and Mediterranean spices used in speculaas are cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cardamom and white pepper; these were common in the 1600–1700s due to the Dutch East Indies spice trade. Family recipes may also include other small amounts of spices like anise, etc. Traditionally, \"speculaas\" were made from Frisian flour and spices. The name \"speculoos\" was coined for Belgian wheat flour cookies with hardly any spices. Today most speculaas versions are made from white (wheat) flour, brown sugar, butter and spices. Some varieties use some almond flour and have slivered almonds embedded in the bottom.\n\nThe dough is prepared by beating butter, sugar and spices and combining them. The flour and leavening agent are mixed separately and then added. Bakers are careful not to overwork the dough, so it will rise slightly. The dough is stored in a cool place overnight to give the spices time to permeate the dough and add extra flavor.\n\nThere are several interpretations for the origins of the name \"speculaas\". It may derive from Latin \"speculum\", which means mirror and refers to the fact that the images are cut as a mirrored bas-relief into a wooden stamp, which is then used to decorate speculaas. Another, less likely, word origin refers to the Latin word \"speculator\" which, among other meanings, could refer to a bishop or St Nicholas' epithet, \"he who sees everything\". Still another possible source is \"Specerij\", the Dutch word for spice.\n\nThe Belgian city of Hasselt is known for a local variety of speculoos. On 13 January 1870, Antonie Deplée, a baker from Hasselt, acquired a license for Hasselt speculoos: \"une espèce de pain d'amandes connu sous le nom de spéculation\" (\"a kind of almond 'bread' known under the name \"spéculation\"\"). He sold this version locally and abroad.\n\nThe German Spekulatius, traditional in Westphalia and the Rhineland, is similar. It is popular throughout the country around Christmastime and usually not available at other times of the year.\n\nIn Europe, Lotus Speculoos is the most recognized brand. In the United States, the same company is branded as Lotus Biscoff. Several chains of supermarkets have started their own product under their generic name.\n\nBy 2007, several Belgian companies began marketing a paste variant of speculoos, now available worldwide under various brands and names: as \"Speculla\", \"Cookie Butter\", \"Biscoff Spread\". As a form of spreadable Speculoos cookies, the flavor is caramelized and gingerbread-like with a color similar to peanut butter and a consistency ranging from creamy to granular or crunchy. The spread consists of 60% crushed speculoos cookies along with vegetable oils.\n\nWorkers in the Low Countries traditionally made a sandwich in the morning with butter and speculaas or speculoos cookies. This would develop into a spread-like consistency by lunchtime. In 2008, two competitors entered a contest on the Belgian television show, \"The Inventors (de Bedenkers)\", with a spread made from speculoos cookies — Els Scheppers, who reached the semi-finals, and the team of chef Danny De Mayer and Dirk De Smet, who weren't selected as finalists. Spreads made from crushed Speculoos cookies would subsequently go into production by three separate companies and become popular.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1047205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1047205", "title": "Saudade", "text": "Saudade\n\nSaudade (, , , ; plural saudades) is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return. One English translation of the word is missingness, although it might not convey the feeling of deep emotion attached to the word \"saudade\". Stronger forms of \"saudade\" might be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as a lost lover, or a family member who has gone missing, moved away, separated, or died.\n\n\"Saudade\" was once described as \"the love that remains\" after someone is gone. \"Saudade\" is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, well-being, which now triggers the senses and makes one live again. It can be described as an emptiness, like someone (e.g., one's children, parents, sibling, grandparents, friends, pets) or something (e.g., places, things one used to do in childhood, or other activities performed in the past) that should be there in a particular moment is missing, and the individual feels this absence. It brings sad and happy feelings together: sadness for missing and happiness for experiencing the past.\n\nNascimento and Meandro (2005) cite Duarte Nunes Leão's definition of saudade: \"Memory of something with a desire for it.\"\n\nIn Brazil, the day of \"Saudade\" is officially celebrated on 30 January.\n\nThe word \"saudade\" was used in the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (13th century), in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and by poets of the time of King Denis of Portugal (reigned 1279–1325).\nSome specialists say the word may have originated during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word has been found in earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.\n\nThe state of mind has subsequently become a \"Portuguese way of life\": a constant feeling of absence, the sadness of something that's missing, wistful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone, a desire for presence as opposed to absence—as it is said in Portuguese, a strong desire to \"matar as saudades\" (lit. \"to kill the saudades\").\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, \"saudade\" became associated with the longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America, and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland, historically speaking \"saudade\" is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called \"Golden Age\", synonymous with the era of discovery, Portugal rose to the status of a world power, and its monarchy became one of the richest in Europe. But with the competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of \"saudade\", aptly described by a sentence in Portugal's national anthem: \"Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal\" (Lift up once again today the splendour of Portugal).\n\nThe \"Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa\" defines \"saudade\" (or \"saudades\") as \"A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness. It is related to thinking back on situations of privation due to the absence of someone or something, to move away from a place or thing, or to the absence of a set of particular and desirable experiences and pleasures once lived.\"\n\nThe Dictionary from the Royal Galician Academy, on the other hand, defines \"saudade\" as an \"intimate feeling and mood caused by the longing for something absent that is being missed. This can take different aspects, from concrete realities (a loved one, a friend, the motherland, the homeland...) to the mysterious and transcendent. It is quite prevalent and characteristic of the galician-portuguese world, but it can also be found in other cultures.\"\n\nSaudade is a word in Portuguese and Galician that claims no direct translation in English. In Portuguese, \"\"Tenho saudades tuas\"\" (European Portuguese) or \"\"Estou com saudades de/você\"\" (Brazilian Portuguese), translates as \"I have (feel) \"saudade\" of you\" meaning \"I miss you\", but carries a much stronger tone. In fact, one can have \"saudade\" of someone whom one is with, but have some feeling of loss towards the past or the future. For example, one can have \"saudade\" towards part of the relationship or emotions once experienced for/with someone, though the person in question is still part of one's life, as in \"Tenho saudade do que fomos\" (I feel \"saudade\" of the way we were). Another example can illustrate this use of the word saudade: \"Que saudade!\" indicating a general feeling of longing, whereby the object of longing can be a general and undefined entity/occasion/person/group/period etc. This feeling of longing can be accompanied or better described by an abstract will to be where the object of longing is.\n\nDespite being hard to translate in full, \"saudade\" has equivalent words in other cultures, and is often related to music styles expressing this feeling such as the \"blues\" for African-Americans, \"Sehnsucht\" in German, \"dor\" in Romania, \"Tizita\" in Ethiopia, \"Hiraeth\" in Welsh, or \"Assouf\" for the Tuareg people, appocundria in Neapolitan. In Slovak, the word is \"clivota\" or \"cnenie\", and in Czech, the word is \"stesk\". In Turkish, the word \"Hasret\" meaning longing, yearning or nostalgia has similar connotations.\n\nThe similar melancholic music style is known in Bosnia-Herzegovina as sevdah (ultimately from Arabic سَوْدَاء sawdā' : 'black [bile]', translation of the Greek µέλαινα χολή, mélaina cholē from which the term melancholy is derived).\n\n\"Saudade\" is similar but not equal to nostalgia, a word that also exists in Portuguese.\n\nIn the book \"In Portugal\" of 1912, A. F. G. Bell writes: \n\nA stronger form of \"saudade\" may be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, it can be a rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.\n\nTo F. D. Santos, \"Saudade\" as a noun has become a longing for longing itself: \n\nAs with all emotions, \"saudade\" has been an inspiration for many songs and compositions. \"Sodade\" (\"saudade\" in Cape Verdean Creole) is the title of the Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora's most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. \"The Good Son\", a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as \"saudade\". He told journalist Chris Bohn: \"When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was \"saudade\". It's not nostalgia but something sadder.\"\nThe usage of \"saudade\" as a theme in Portuguese music goes back to the 16th century, the golden age of Portugal. \"Saudade\", as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many villancicos and cantigas composed by Portuguese authors; for example: \"Lágrimas de Saudade\" (\"tears of saudade\"), which is an anonymous work from the \"Cancioneiro de Paris\". Fado is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the \"fadista\") along with a Portuguese guitar. The most popular themes of fado are \"saudade\", nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. Fado and \"saudade\" are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin \"fatum\" meaning \"fate\" or \"destiny\". Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of \"saudade\", a bitter-sweet, existential yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control.\n\nSpanish singer Julio Iglesias, whose father is a Galician, speaks of \"saudade\" in his song \"Un Canto a Galicia\" (which roughly translates as \"a song/chant for Galicia\"). In the song, he passionately uses the phrase to describe a deep and sad longing for his motherland, Galicia. He also performs a song called \"Morriñas\", which describes the Galicians as having a deeply strong \"saudade\".\n\nThe Paraguayan guitarist Agustin Barrios wrote several pieces invoking the feeling of \"saudade\", including \"Choro de Saudade\" and \"Preludio Saudade\". The term is prominent in Brazilian popular music, including the first bossa nova song, \"Chega de Saudade\" (\"No more \"saudade\"\", usually translated as \"No More Blues\"), written by Tom Jobim.\nJazz pianist Bill Evans recorded the tune \"Saudade de Brasil\" numerous times. In 1919, on returning from two years in Brazil, the French composer Darius Milhaud composed a suite, \"Saudades do Brasil\", which exemplified the concept of \"saudade\". \"Saudade (Part II)\" is also the title of a flute solo by the band Shpongle. The singer Amália Rodrigues typified themes of \"saudade\" in some of her songs. J-Rock band Porno Graffitti has a song entitled \"サウダージ\", \"Saudaaji\" transliterated (\"Saudade\"). The alternative rock band Love And Rockets has a song named \"Saudade\" on their album \"Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven\". June 2012 brought Bearcat's release of their self-titled indie album that included a song called \"Saudade\".\n\nThe Dutch jazz/Rock guitarist Jan Akkerman recorded a composition called \"Saudade\", the centerpiece of his 1996 album \"Focus in Time\". The Belgian electronic music band Arsenal recorded a song called \"Saudade\" on their album \"Outsides\" (2005). The jazz fusion group Trio Beyond, consisting of John Scofield, Jack DeJohnette, and Larry Goldings released in 2006 an album dedicated to drummer Tony Williams (1945–1997), called \"Saudades\". Dance music artist Peter Corvaia released a progressive house track entitled \"Saudade\" on HeadRush Music, a sub-label of Toes in the Sand Recordings. New York City post-rock band Mice Parade released an album entitled \"Obrigado Saudade\" in 2004. Chris Rea also recorded a song entitled \"Saudade Part 1 & 2 (Tribute To Ayrton Senna)\" as a tribute to Ayrton Senna, the Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion killed on the track in May 1994. There is an ambient/noise/shoegazing band from Portland, Oregon, named Saudade. The rock band Extreme has a Portuguese guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the influence of his heritage can be seen in the band's album \"Saudades de Rock\". During recording, the mission statement was to bring back musicality to the medium. \"Nancy Spain\", a song by Barney Rush, made famous by an adaptation by Christy Moore, is another example of the use of \"saudade\" in contemporary Irish music, the chorus of which is:\n\n\"No matter where I wander I'm still haunted by your name\nThe portrait of your beauty stays the same\nStanding by the ocean wondering where you've gone\nIf you'll return again\nWhere is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain?\"\nAmerican singer/songwriter Grayson Hugh wrote a song called \"Saudade\" that he performed with jazz guitarist Norman Johnson on Johnson's 2013 album \"Get It While You Can\". \n\nKingston-Upon-Hull IDM Electronica, Downtempo and Deep Groove legend, Steve Cobby, of Fila Brazillia, Solid Doctor, Heights of Abraham, the Twilight Singers debut notoriety and other musical incarnations and collaborations, released a 12 track album \"Saudade\" in March 2014 on DÉCLASSÉ Recordings.\n\nWashington DC electronica duo Thievery Corporation released the studio album \"Saudade\" in 2014 via their Eighteenth Street Lounge Music label.\n\nThe Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa's posthumous collection of writings \"The Book of Disquiet\" is written almost entirely in a tone of saudade, and deals with themes of nostalgia and alienation. Australian author Suneeta Peres Da Costa's novella \"Saudade\" follows Maria, a young girl from a Goan immigrant family, growing up in a political hierarchy of racism and colonialism\n\n\"Saudade\" is also associated with Galicia, where it is used similarly to the word \"morriña\" (longingness). Yet, morriña often implies a deeper stage of \"saudade\", a \"\"saudade\" so strong it can even kill,\" as the Galician saying goes. Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind. Although \"saudade\" is also a Galician word, the meaning of \"longing for something that might return\" is generally associated with \"morriña\". A literary example showing the understanding of the difference and the use of both words is the song \"Un canto a Galicia\" by Julio Iglesias. The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the Academia.\n\nIn Portugal, \"morrinha\" is a word to describe sprinkles, while \"morrinhar\" means \"to sprinkle.\" (The most common Portuguese equivalents are \"chuvisco\" and \"chuviscar\", respectively.) \"Morrinha\" is also used in northern Portugal for referring to sick animals, for example of sheep dropsy, and occasionally to sick or sad people, often with irony. It is also used in some Brazilian regional dialects for the smell of wet or sick animals.\n\nIn Goa, India, which was a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese influences still remain. A suburb of Margão, Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu \"shmashana\" (cremation ground) and the Muslim \"qabrastan\" (cemetery). Most people living in the city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they often think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word \"saudade\" takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred with the end of the Portuguese regime in these parts.\n\nIn Cape Verdean Creole there is the word \"sodadi\" (also spelled \"sodade\"), originated in the Portuguese \"saudade\" and exactly with the same meaning.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1052492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052492", "title": "Hurley (stick)", "text": "Hurley (stick)\n\nA hurley (or camán) is a wooden stick used in the Irish sports of hurling and camogie. It measures between 45 and 96 cm (18 to 38 inches) long with a flattened, curved \"bas\" at the end, which provides the striking surface. It is used to strike the leather \"sliotar\" ball.\n\nA hurley is also known as a hurl, hurley stick, hurling stick or as a \"camán\" (the Irish word).\n\nHurleys are made from ash wood; the base of the tree near the root is the only part used and is usually bought from local craftsmen in Ireland (for about 20–50 euro), who still use traditional production methods. However, for some time in the 1970s, hurleys made from plastic were used, mainly produced by Wavin. These proved more likely to cause injury, however, and were phased out. As of 2012, at least one manufacturer was producing synthetic hurleys approved for use by the GAA. Steel bands are used to reinforce the flattened end of the hurley though these are not permitted in camogie due to increased risk of injury. Bands have been put on hurleys since the beginning; the 8th century Brehon Laws permit only a king's son to have a bronze band, while all others must use a copper band.\n\nNo matter how well crafted the hurley is, a hurler may well expect to use several hurleys over the course of the hurling season. The hurleys often break if two collide in the course of a game, or occasionally they break off on the other players (arms, legs, etc.). Two hurleys colliding is colloquially known as \"the clash of the ash\". Some hurleys can be repaired by a method called \"splicing\". This method involves cutting a bas-shaped piece from another broken hurley and fixing it to the broken bas by way of glue and nails; the two-piece bas is then banded (\"hooped\") and sanded into shape. (The face of the hurley is called the bas, and is the area used to strike the ball.) Throwing the hurley (e.g., to block a ball going high over one's head) is illegal, though camogie players may drop it to make a handpass.\n\nThere are names associated with different parts of the hurley. With respect to the picture above, the \"bas\" is the rounded end of the hurley where the sliotar makes contact as it is being struck. At the same end the \"heel\" of the hurley is the area to the left of the band and at the hurley's edge (nearest the bottom of the picture above). It is used to give height to a ball struck on the ground. The rounded area to the right of the band is the \"toe\" of the hurley and is used in the roll lift or jab lift techniques which allow a player to gain legal possession of a ball into the hand from the ground. The handle is at the opposite end of the hurley to the boss, with the timber cut to form a small lip at the peak (to prevent the hurley from slipping from the player's hand). The handle is typically wrapped with a self-adhesive synthetic foam grip.\n\nWhen selecting a hurley, choosing the correct size is very important as a hurley that is the incorrect length can be difficult to swing correctly. A correctly sized hurley should be just touching the ground when gripped at the top and held parallel to the player's leg with their arms relaxed. Traditionally it was recommended that the toe of the hurley should reach the player's hip when the heel of the hurley is placed on the ground and held parallel to the player's leg. This has proved inaccurate and unsuitable since two players of the same height can have a difference of 4 inches or 10 centimetres in hip height. \n\nThe hurley is often given as a gift to or between politicians; for example, Mary and Martin McAleese were given two when she was awarded the freedom of Kilkenny in 2009, and Barack Obama was given one by Enda Kenny on his visit to Ireland in 2011. Prince Philip was also given a hurley and sliotar as a gift during Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ireland.\n\nJason Statham used a hurley as a weapon in the opening scene of the 2011 film \"Blitz\".\n\n"}

First test marketed in 1963 under the name Patio Diet Cola, it was re-branded as \"Diet Pepsi\" the following year, becoming the first diet cola to be distributed on a national scale in the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s its competition consisted of Tab, produced by The Coca-Cola Company, and Diet Rite soda, produced by Royal Crown. Diet Coke was a later entrant to the diet cola market; though shortly after entering production in 1982 it became the primary competing diet cola to Diet Pepsi.\n\nWhile the U.S. represents the largest single market for Diet Pepsi, it was launched in the U.K. in 1983 and has since become available on a global scale. The beverage composition, flavor variations and packaging varies based on the country of production. In some countries—primarily in Eastern Europe—the product is labeled and sold under the name Pepsi Light. In the UK it was called Pepsi Diet to bring it inline with the European version, until 2015 when it was renamed \"Diet Pepsi\" once again.\n\nDiet Pepsi was originally test marketed in the United States under the name Patio in 1963. Following a positive reception attributed to the shifting dietary habits and preferences among the Baby Boomers at the time, the drink was launched nationally as Diet Pepsi the following year. It became the first diet cola to be distributed on a national scale in the US. Distribution was extended to the United Kingdom in 1983, where it is also referred to as Diet Pepsi. \n\nDistribution has since expanded to other countries around the world; though an alternate name is used in certain countries. In Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, Argentina, Spain Greece, Turkey,\nRussia, Ukraine, and Brazil, the beverage is known as \"Pepsi Light\".\n\nDiet Pepsi competed primarily with The Coca-Cola Company's Tab in the 1960s and 1970s; however, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Diet Coke in 1982 which has since been the principal competing product to Diet Pepsi. As of 2010, Diet Pepsi represented a 5.3 percent share of all carbonated soft drink sales in the United States, and was ranked as the #7 soft drink brand by volume. In the same year, Diet Coke was recorded as having a 9.9 percent market share.\n\nIn December 2012, an AP article reported that Diet Pepsi was changing its sweetener to sucralose ahead of a major rebranding of the soft drink set for January 2013. In 2015, some people on Facebook and Twitter expressed their distaste for the new formula. In response, Pepsi revived its aspartame formulation, as \"Diet Pepsi Classic Sweetener Blend\" for US markets in September 2016, and it was sold alongside the new formula. PepsiCo later announced plans to revert Diet Pepsi's sweetener from sucralose to aspartame. The new formulation was released marketwide on February 25, 2018.\n\nAdditional variations of Diet Pepsi have been introduced over the years, wherein other flavors (such as wild cherry, vanilla, lemon, and lime) have been added to the cola. A caffeine-free version of Diet Pepsi is also produced. The availability and brand identification of Diet Pepsi flavor variants varies by country. In addition to Diet Pepsi, PepsiCo also produces the low-calorie cola Pepsi Max.\n\nIn the United States, Diet Pepsi is marketed as having zero calories, as FDA guidelines categorize products with fewer than five calories per serving to be labeled as containing \"zero calories\".\n\nThough Diet Pepsi is represented worldwide as a low- or no-calorie beverage, the ingredients comprising its makeup vary in some cases by the country of origin. In the US, its ingredients are recorded as \"carbonated water, caramel color, aspartame, phosphoric acid, potassium benzoate (preserves freshness), caffeine, citric acid, natural flavor; phenylketonurics: contains phenylalanine\". In Canada, the ingredient listing reads: \"carbonated water, caramel color, phosphoric acid, aspartame (124 mg/355 ml, contains phenylalanine), sodium benzoate, caffeine, flavor, acesulfame potassium (32 mg/355ml), citric acid, dimethylpolysiloxane\". Comparatively in the UK, Diet Pepsi is listed as consisting of \"carbonated water, colour (caramel E150d), flavorings (including caffeine), phosphoric acid, sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame K), acidity regulator (sodium citrate), preservative (sodium benzoate), citric acid, contains a source of phenylalanine\".\n\nThe initial formulation of Diet Pepsi was sweetened with the artificial sweetener saccharin, although concerns over saccharin emerged in the 1970s, prompting a shift to an alternative sweetener, aspartame, which was marketed as the brand NutraSweet, in 1983. Aspartame has been the subject of controversy, most notably in 1996 following a \"60 Minutes\" report on concerns alleging that aspartame might be linked to the development of brain tumors in humans. Critics of aspartame have expressed concerns that numerous health risks may be associated with its consumption; however, peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have described it as safe for consumption at current levels. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.K. Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Canada's Health Canada.\n\nWhen it was first introduced in 1964, Diet Pepsi was packaged in glass bottles, and was also made available in can format. In 1994, Diet Pepsi became the first product to list a “freshness date” on each individual can and bottle, a practice that would later become a widespread standard in the packaged food and beverage industry. As of 2018, the product is distributed in plastic bottles, cans, and glass bottles, as well as via soda fountains in retail operations such as restaurants and convenience stores.\n\nThe logo used in the packaging and advertisement of Diet Pepsi has changed multiple times since its original iteration. In October 2008, PepsiCo announced it would be redesigning its logo and re-branding many of its products, including Diet Pepsi. At this time the brand's blue and red Pepsi Globe logo became a series of \"smiles,\" with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product. In the case of Diet Pepsi, the logo consisted of the small \"smile\". Starting in mid-2010, all Pepsi variants, both regular and diet, began using the medium-sized \"smile\" logo.\n\nThe Classic Sweetener Blend variety was distinguished by its use of the 2003-2006 wordmark along with the \"smile\" logo, and a light blue label background in contrast to the modern formulation's silver label. By mid-2017, packages of Classic Sweetener Blend dropped the 2003 wordmark, and began using the modernized wordmark instead. With the restoration of aspartame as the main sweetener in the regular version, the alternate label was dropped. \n\nWhile it was initially advertised alongside Pepsi, Diet Pepsi began to be promoted independently in the late 1960s. The first television advertisement to feature Diet Pepsi as a standalone product was “Girlwatchers,” which placed focus on the cosmetic aspects of the beverage. The musical jingle from this ad generated popular culture appeal to the extent that it was eventually recorded and played on the radio, and later became a Top 40 hit.\n\nSince its inception, musicians, professional athletes, actors and actresses have been featured prominently in the promotion of Diet Pepsi. In 1985, immediately following Super Bowl XIX, the game's respective quarterbacks, Joe Montana and Dan Marino, met in a hallway of what appeared to be a football stadium. Montana of the winning team, buys Marino a Diet Pepsi, and Marino promises to buy the drink the next time. A Diet Pepsi advertisement in the same year featured Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to run for vice-president in the U.S. When the feature film \"Top Gun\" was released on home video cassette in 1987, it was promoted via television advertisements – consisting of a Top Gun pilot flying upside down while holding a bottle of Diet Pepsi – which were paid for by Pepsi. In exchange, the film's production studio, Paramount Pictures, included a 60-second Diet Pepsi advertisement on all Top Gun VHS tapes. The resulting cross-promotion was the first of its kind, and after it set record videocassette sales, it was described as \"the beginning of a trend\" by \"The Los Angeles Times\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, Michael J. Fox appeared in commercials for Diet Pepsi, including a memorable commercial that featured him making a robot clone of himself. In that commercial, Fox's girlfriend (played by Lori Loughlin) shows up and accidentally hits Fox with the door, causing him to fall down a chute into the basement. The girlfriend takes the robot clone on a date and leaves the real Fox trapped.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, R&B singer Ray Charles was featured in a series of Diet Pepsi ads featuring the brand's then-current tagline, \"You got the right one, baby!\" Supermodel Cindy Crawford became a recurring celebrity endorser for the Diet Pepsi brand at this time as well, beginning with a 1991 television ad in which she purchases a can of the drink from a vending machine on a hot summer day. Cindy Crawford was also brought back in 2002 to introduce a new packaging design for Diet Pepsi, and again in 2005 to promote the revised slogan \"Light, crisp, refreshing\" with an ad which debuted during Super Bowl XXXIX. In 2005 and 2006, recording artist Gwen Stefani appeared in advertisements related to a campaign in which codes printed underneath Diet Pepsi bottle caps could be redeemed for music downloads on Apple's iTunes Store.\n\n\n"}

Common modern red velvet cake is made with red dye; the red color was originally due to non-Dutched, anthocyanin-rich cocoa.\n\nCommon ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, vinegar, and flour. Beetroot or red food coloring may be used for the color.\n\nVelvet cake is thought to originate in the Victorian era. During that Era they served velvet cakes as a fancy dessert. The term \"velvet\" was a description used to let consumers know the dessert was a soft and velvety crumb cake. During that same time devil's food cake was introduced, which is how some believe that red velvet cake came about. The difference between the two cakes is that devil's food cake uses chocolate and red velvet cake uses cocoa.\n\nWhen foods were rationed during World War II, bakers used boiled beet juices to enhance the color of their cakes. Beets are found in some red velvet cake recipes. Beets were and are in some recipes used as a filler or to retain moisture.Adams Extract, a Texas company, is credited with bringing the red velvet cake to kitchens across America during the Great Depression era, by being one of the first to sell red food coloring and other flavor extracts with the use of point-of-sale posters and tear-off recipe cards. The cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States from New York City's famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which has dubbed the confection Waldorf-Astoria cake. However, it is widely considered a Southern recipe. Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with a French-style butter roux icing (also called ermine icing), which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to prepare. Cream cheese frosting and buttercream frosting are variations which have increased in popularity.\n\nIn Canada, the cake was a well-known dessert in the restaurants and bakeries of the Eaton's department store chain in the 1940s and 1950s. Promoted as an exclusive Eaton's recipe, with employees who knew the recipe sworn to silence, many mistakenly believed the cake was the invention of the department store matriarch, Lady Eaton.\n\nIn recent years, red velvet cake and red velvet cupcakes have become increasingly popular in the US and many European countries. A resurgence in the popularity of this cake is attributed by some to the film \"Steel Magnolias\" (1989), which included a red velvet groom's cake made in the shape of an armadillo. Magnolia Bakery in Manhattan has served it since its opening in 1996, as did restaurants known for their Southern cooking like Amy Ruth's in Harlem, which opened in 1998. In 2000, Cake Man Raven opened one of the first bakeries devoted to the cake in Brooklyn.\n\nIngredient changes vary based on the era and area of the world. James Beard's reference, \"American Cookery\" (1972), describes three red velvet cakes varying in the amounts of shortening, butter, and vegetable oil. All used red food coloring. The reaction of acidic vinegar and buttermilk tends to better reveal the red anthocyanin in cocoa and keeps the cake moist, light, and fluffy. This natural tinting may have been the source for the name \"red velvet\", as well as \"Devil's food\" and similar names for chocolate cakes. Today, chocolate has often undergone Dutch processing, which prevents the color change of the anthocyanins. A reconstruction of the original red velvet cake involves reducing or eliminating the vinegar and colorants and using a non-Dutched cocoa to provide the needed acidity and color.\n\nIn addition to the many variations of red velvet cake, there are various red velvet-flavored products, including protein powder, tea, lattes, Pop-Tarts, waffles, and alcoholic beverages. The scent is used for candles and air fresheners as well. For dietary restrictions, such as those due to allergies and ingredient sensitivity, vegan, gluten free, and dairy free variations are available.\n"}

Similarly to English \"pancake\", the latter derives from \"Pfanne\" (\"pan\") and \"Kuchen\" (\"cake\"). The diminutive form \"pampushka\" is used more frequently than the basic form.\n\nPampusky are made of yeast dough from wheat, rye or buckwheat flour. Traditionally they are baked but may also be fried. Savoury pampusky have no filling. They are usually seasoned with garlic sauce and often served as a side dish with red borscht or yushka. Sweet pampushky may be filled with fruits, berries, varenye, povydlo or poppy seeds, and topped with powdered sugar.\n\nAccording to William Pokhlyobkin, the technology of making pampushky points to German cuisine, and these buns were possibly created by German colonists in Ukraine. They spread through the country in the second half of the 19th century and later reached the \"status\" of a Ukrainian traditional dish.\n\nSince 2008 yearly Pampukh Festivals have been organised around Orthodox Christmas time (in January) in Lviv.

The trademarked name is a contracted form of the Latin word \"pabulum\", which means \"foodstuff\". The name \"pablum\" had long been used in botany and medicine to refer to nutrition or substances of which the nutritive elements are passively absorbed.\n\nIn a broader sense, the word can also refer to something that is bland, mushy, unappetizing, or infantile.\n\nPablum Mixed Cereal was made from a mixture of ground and precooked wheat (farina), oatmeal, yellow corn meal, bone meal, dried brewer's yeast, and powdered alfalfa leaf, fortified with reduced iron – providing an assortment of minerals and vitamins A, B, B, D, and E. Pablum is palatable and easily digested without causing side effects like diarrhea or constipation. It is also unlikely to cause allergic reactions, as it does not contain eggs, lactose or nuts of any kind (although it does contain wheat and corn, either of which can be allergenic for some individuals).\n\nPablum was developed by Canadian pediatricians Frederick Tisdall, Theodore Drake, and Alan Brown, in collaboration with nutrition laboratory technician Ruth Herbert (all of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto), along with Mead Johnson chemist Harry H. Engel. The cereal marked a breakthrough in nutritional science: it helped prevent rickets, a crippling childhood disease, by ensuring that children had sufficient vitamin D in their diet. Fluoride was not discovered until 1939 by H.T. Dean, but Pablum probably prevented a few cavities, too. From the bone meal it had about 12 ppm F, which works out to about what pediatricians were prescribing about 4 decades later.\n\nAlthough neither Pablum nor its biscuit predecessor was the first food designed and sold specifically for babies, it was the first baby food to come precooked and thoroughly dried. The ease of preparation made Pablum successful in an era when infant malnutrition was still a major problem in industrialized countries.\n\nFor a period of 25 years, the Hospital for Sick Children and the Toronto Pediatric Foundation received a royalty on every package of Pablum sold. In 2005, the Pablum brand was acquired by the H. J. Heinz Company.\n\n\n"}

Pretzels were introduced by Roman Catholic monks in the 13th century in Denmark, and from there they spread throughout Scandinavia and evolved into several kinds of sweet, salty or filled pastries, all in the shape of kringle.\n\nIn Danish and Norwegian, the word is \"kringle\", plural \"kringler\"; , plural \"kringlid\"; , plural \"kliņģeri\"; , plural \"kringlor\"; ; and Icelandic: \"kringla\". The word originates from the Old Norse \"kringla\", meaning ring or circle.\n\nIn the Netherlands, a particular type of sweet kringle is well known under the Dutch name \"krakeling\".\n\nThe shape of the kringle has given name to a similarly entangled feature found in some proteins, the so-called Kringle domain.\n\nIn Denmark, \"kringle\" denotes the pretzel-like knotted shape rather than the pretzel pastry type. Kringler may be made from puff pastry (like Danish pastry) or yeast dough, filled with remonce or marzipan and raisins, sprinkled with coarse sugar, nut flakes or icing.\n\nOther types of kringle in Scandinavia includes \"saltkringler\", which are small salty kringler - the Scandinavian equivalent of pretzels -, and \"kommenskringler\" which are half-hand-sized breads in the kringle shape, made from unsweetened yeast dough spiced with caraway seeds. \"Sukkerkringler\" are similar, but sweet pretzels, sprinkled with sugar instead of caraway. \"Smørkringler\" are large crusty and sweet pretzels with a spread of butter on the backside. Smørkringler are not as popular nowadays.\n\nKringler are pastries with a long history in Denmark, and are still popular items in modern Danish bakeries. Nowadays, kringle is usually made with only one crossing and not two, as in the original kringle and pretzel shape.\n\nIn the United States, kringles are hand-rolled from Danish pastry dough (\"wienerbrød\" dough) that has been rested overnight before shaping, filling, and baking. Many sheets of the flaky dough are layered, then shaped into an oval. After filling with fruit, nut, or other flavor combinations, the pastry is baked and iced.\n\nRacine, Wisconsin has historically been a center of Danish-American culture and kringle making. A typical Racine–made kringle is a large flat oval measuring approximately 14 inches by 10 inches and weighing about 1.5 pounds. The kringle became the official state pastry of Wisconsin on June 30, 2013. A Wisconsin distillery, in Middleton, Wisconsin, makes a kringle cream liqueur from Wisconsin cream, rum, sugar, and natural kringle flavor.\n\nIn other parts of the United States, kringle may refer to a slightly sweet buttermilk cookie shaped like a pretzel or figure eight.\n\nOther places where kringles may be found in the United States include the Ballard area of Seattle, Washington; Redmond, Washington; Solvang, California; central Iowa; Burr Ridge, Illinois; Springfield, Missouri and Watertown, Massachusetts. In 2005, Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, held a Kringle Kontest, which was won by Kirsten's Danish Bakery in Burr Ridge, Illinois.\n\nBaker's guilds in Europe have used the kringle or pretzel as a symbol for centuries. It is told (but currently unconfirmed by historic documents), that when Vienna was besieged by the Turkish Ottoman armies in 1529, local bakers working in the night gave the city defence an early warning of the attacking enemy. For this, they were later rewarded by the Pope, with permission to use a crown as part of their kringle guild symbol.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the guild in Denmark is now the only baker's guild in the world with official authority to display a royal crown as part of their baker's guild trade symbol that is often hung outside of bakery shops.\n\n"}

The word \"so\", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of \"Well...\" or to function as an indirect way of saying \"Before answering that, I'd like to...\" or even instead of saying \"On the contrary...\" or \"No, I...\".\n\nIn a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).\n\nSince such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers.

Penuche often has a tannish color, and is lighter than regular fudge. It is formed by the caramelization of brown sugar; thus, its flavor is said to be reminiscent of caramel. Nuts, especially pecans, are often added to penuche for texture, especially in the making of penuche candies. It is primarily a regional food, found in New England and some places in the Southern United States, though in the latter it goes by different names, including creamy praline fudge, and brown sugar fudge candy.\n\n\"Panocha\" is said to come from the Spanish word for 'raw sugar'. It was also long rumored to be slightly dirty or naughty in nature in Portuguese as slang. Penuche is thought to have origins in Portugal and was made popular in New England among Portuguese whaling families in New Bedford, MA, and Essex, CT, during the whaling period of the mid to late 1700's through the end of commercial whaling. This also explains why the fudge is popular almost nowhere else but in Hawaii - brought there by whaling ships and still found in candy shops on Oahu, The Big Island, and Maui. Penuche is also used as a boiled icing flavor. In Hawaii, its name is localized as \"panocha\" or panuche. Hawaiian cooks often reminisce about both panocha fudge and icing. As an icing, it was common as topping for prune cake. \n\nPenuche is classed in the fudge family because it follows a similar method of preparation:\nMost traditional (i.e. not \"no-cook\" or \"quick\") fudges follow a similar preparation method. What distinguishes penuche is the use of brown sugar rather than white.\n\nIn recent years, it has become common in New England to add maple syrup to the recipe for penuche fudge. Some confectioners will call this \"maple syrup penuche fudge\", and others do not make any distinction at all.\n\nOne penuche-style recipe is called \"no-bake penuche drop cookies\", which is made from brown sugar, milk, butter, oats, and nuts.\n\nA very similar confection is \"Sucre à la Crème\" (cream sugar), a Québec confection traditionally prepared during the winter holiday season. The universality of the brown sugar and dairy confection manifests in the form of a slightly crumblier treat called \"Tablet\" originating in Scotland.\n\n"}

Alternatively known as \"Bhedavāda\", \"Tattvavāda\" and \"Bimbapratibimbavāda\", Dvaita Vedanta sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar Madhvacharya. The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. The Dvaita school contrasts with the other two major sub-schools of Vedanta, the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara which posits nondualism – that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul are identical and all reality is interconnected oneness, and Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja which posits qualified nondualism – that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul are different but with the potential to be identical.\n\nDvaita (द्वैत) is a Sanskrit word that means \"duality, dualism\". The term refers to any premise, particularly in theology on the temporal and the divine, where two principles (truths) or realities are posited to exist simultaneously and independently.\n\nDvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas, espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the only independent reality (svatantra-tattva), states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu as Brahman. Vishnu is the supreme Self, in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions. The second reality is that of dependent (asvatantra-tattva) but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul, matter, and the like exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.\n\nLike Ramanuja, Madhvacharya also embraced Vaishnavism. Madhvacharya posits God as being personal and \"saguna\", that is endowed with attributes and qualities. To Madhvacharya, the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas was Vishnu. He stated \"\"brahmaśabdaśca Viṣṇaveva\"\", that Brahman can only refer to Vishnu. To him, Vishnu was not just any other deva, but rather the one and only Supreme Being.\n\nDvaita Vedanta acknowledges two principles; however, it holds one of them (the sentient) as being eternally dependent on the other. The individual souls are depicted as reflections, images or shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Moksha (liberation) therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.\n\nFive fundamental, eternal and real differences are described in Dvaita school:\n\nThese five differences are said to explain the nature of the universe. The world is called \"prapañca\" (\"pañca\" \"five\") by the Dvaita school for this reason.\n\nMadhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, \"mukti-yogyas\", qualifies for liberation, another, the \"nitya-samsarins\", subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, \"tamo-yogyas\", who are condemned to eternal hell (\"andhatamasa\"). No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A girl, wearing a skirt made of fresh green knitted vines and small branches, sings and dances through the streets of the village, stopping at every house, where the hosts sprinkle water on her. She is accompanied by the people of the village who dance and shout on the music. The custom has attributed a specific type of dance and a specific melody.\n\nAccording to some interpretations, Dodola is a Slavic goddess of rain, and the wife of the supreme god Perun (who is the god of thunder). Slavs believed that when Dodola milks her heavenly cows, the clouds, it rains on earth. Each spring Dodola is said to fly over woods and fields, and spread vernal greenery, decorating the trees with blossoms.\n\nThe custom is known by two names, mostly spelled \"Dodola\" (\"dodole\", \"dudula\", \"dudulica\", \"dodolă\") and \"Perperuna\" (\"peperuda\", \"peperuna\", \"perperuna\", \"prporuša\", \"preporuša\", \"paparudă\", \"pirpirună\"). Both names are used by the South Slavs and Romanians.\n\nThe name \"Perperuna\" is identified as a feminine personification of the great god Perun. Sorin Paliga suggested that it was a divinity from the local Thracian substratum. The name of \"Dodola\" is possibly cognate with the Lithuanian word for thunder: \"dundulis\".\n\nD. Decev compared the word \"dodola\" (also \"dudula\", \"dudulica\", etc.) with Thracian anthroponyms (personal names) and toponyms (place names), such as \"Doidalsos\", \"Doidalses\", \"Dydalsos\", \"Dudis\", \"Doudoupes\", etc. Paliga argued that based on this, the custom most likely originated from the Thracians.\n\nA much more likely explanation for the variations of the name Didilya is that this is a title for the spring goddess Lada/Lela that got turned into the \"name\" of a goddess. Ralston explains that dido, means “great” and is usually used in conjunction with the spring god Lado. \n\nThe first written description of the custom was left by the Bulgarian hieromonk Spiridon Gabrovski in 1792. He tells how in times of drought young boys and girls would dress one of themselves in a net and a wreath of leaves in the like of Perun or Peperud, who Spiridon mistakenly believed to be an old Bulgarian ruler. Then they would go around houses singing, dancing and pouring water over themselves. Villagers would give them money, which they later used to buy food and drink to celebrate in Perun’s honor.\n\nSouth Slavs used to organise the Dodole (or Perperuna) festival in times of drought, where they worshipped the goddess and prayed to her for rain. In the ritual, young women sing specific songs to Dodola, accompanying it by a dance, while covered in leaves and small branches. In Croatia Dodole is often performed by folklore groups.\n\nIn folklore of Turopolje on the holidays of St. Juraj called \"Jurjevo\" five most beautiful maidens are picked to portray Dodola goddesses in leaf-dresses and sing for the village till the end of the holiday.\n\nCroatian ritual chant sung by youngsters going through the village in the dry, summer months.\n\nNaša dodo Boga moli,\n\nDa orosi sitna kiša,\n\nOj, dodo, oj dodole!\n\nMi idemo preko sela,\n\nA kišica preko polja,\n\nOj, dodo, oj, dodole!\n\nThe oldest record for Dodole rituals in Macedonia is the song \"Oj Ljule\" from Struga region, recorded in 1861.\n\nThe Dodole rituals in Macedonia were active held until the 1960s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1066721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1066721", "title": "Moe (slang)", "text": "Moe (slang)\n\nMoe used in slang refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in manga, anime, video games, and other media. Characters that elicit feelings of \"moe\" are called \"\"moe\" characters.\" The word has also evolved to be used regarding all kinds of topics. Included in the meaning of the word is the idea that \"deep feelings felt towards a particular subject\" is used in cases where a simple \"like\" is not enough to express the feeling. The common feature in all feelings of \"moe\" is that the subject of such feelings is something that one cannot possibly have a real relationship with, like a fictional character, a pop idol, or an inorganic substance. It can be considered a kind of \"pseudo-romance,\" but it is not always seen to be the same as \"romance.\"\n\nThe term's origin and etymology are unknown. Anime columnist John Oppliger has outlined several popular theories describing how the term would have stemmed from the name of anime heroines, such as Hotaru Tomoe from \"Sailor Moon\" (Tomoe is written as , relevant kanji is the same) or Moe Sagisawa from the 1993 anime \"Kyōryū Wakusei\". Psychologist Tamaki Saitō identifies it as coming from the Japanese word for \"budding\", . Ken Kitabayashi of the Nomura Research Institute has defined \"moe\" as \"being strongly attracted to one's ideals\" Kitabayashi has identified the word \"moe\" to be a pun with the Japanese verb for 'to sprout', , and its homophone 'to burn', . Along the same line of thought, Kitabayashi has identified it to be a pun with the Japanese verb for 'to sprout' and its homophone 'to burn' , which mean 'to burn' (in the sense of one's heart burning, or burning with passion). Galbraith states that the term came from 2channel in the 1990s, discussing female characters who were \"hybrids of the Lolicon (Lolita Complex) and bishoujo (beautiful girl) genres\". This accurately describes the aforementioned Hotaru Tomoe, and coincides with her height of popularity in 2channel, giving strength to the theory that the term stemmed from her name. Another reason why the term could have originated from Hotaru Tomoe is her background story. The term has been associated with characters that give off the aura that they need to be protected because they are vulnerable, and Hotaru fits that category; in the manga, a lab accident kills her mother and leaves Hotaru severely injured.\n\nComiket organiser Ichikawa Koichi has described Lum Invader of \"Urusei Yatsura\" as being both the source of \"moe\" and the first \"tsundere\". The character of Clarisse from Hayao Miyazaki's \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" (1979) has also been cited as a potential ancestral example. According to culture critic Hiroki Azuma, as Rei Ayanami became a more prominent character among fans, she \"changed the rules\" governing what people regarded as \"moe\"-inspiring. The industry has since created many characters which share her traits of pale skin, blue hair and a \"quiet personality\".\n\n\"Moe\" characters have expanded within the Japanese media market. In 2004, the market for \"moe\" media such as printed media, video, and games was worth 88 billion yen; roughly one-third of the estimated 290 billion yen \"otaku\" market in Japan. In 2009, Brad Rice, editor-in-chief of \"Japanator\", said that \"moe has literally become an economic force\" saying that more products use some element of \"moe\" in order to sell better. Brad also goes on to say that \"moe\" is used to get anime, and manga works out to \"hardcore fans who buy excessive amounts of items related to the character of their desire.\"\n\nJohn Oppliger from \"AnimeNation\" traced the first decade of the 2000s as the time when \"moe\" became increasingly popular and recognized. Commercialization was a result of interest that followed, and \"moe\" evolved from being a non-sexual desire to being a sexually sublimated fascination with cuteness. Brad goes on to say that \"moe\" shifted entirely from an interchange between character and viewer, to a focused fetish of viewers. Examples used by Brad include the series; \"K-On\", \"Lucky Star\", and \"Moetan\" where he points out they are \"revolved around adorable, whimsical, clumsy, early-adolescent girl characters in order to evoke, enflame, and manipulate the interests and affections of viewers.\" Rather than evoking \"moe\" feelings, they were literally \"moe\" characters that had defining characteristics of the \"moe\" style. Brad referred to these girl characters as \"adorably cute, just a bit sexually appealing, and self-conscious but not yet cynical\" going on to say that they demand notice, and adoration rather than passively earning it.\n\nWith \"moe\" anthropomorphism, \"moe\" characteristics are applied to give human elements to non-human objects. The \"Gradius\" video game series features a spaceship named \"Vic Viper\". For a spin-off game, \"moe\" is applied to \"Vic Viper\" to create \"Otomedius\".\n\nSometimes feelings of \"moe\" towards fictional characters include \"sexual excitement\", or are understood in the context where \"lots of beautiful girls and boobs appear.\" In these cases, feelings of pure affection that gradually become stronger over time can lead to these feelings of eroticism.\n\n\"Moe\", however, is also considered to be distinct from pure lust. While small amounts of lust is generally considered \"moe\", a feeling that focuses too heavily on lust is considered outside the scope of \"moe\". In a light novel by Nagaru Tanigawa, one of the characters mentions that the distinction between \"moe\" and pure lust can be made based on whether one can still maintain feelings of affection even after one has indulged in masturbation. According to commentator, who considers \"moe\" to be \"romance within one's head\", the ideal kind of love within \"moe\" is \"romantic love\".\n\nSeveral informal contests or rankings for characters considered to be \"moe\" exist on the internet. One such contest is the \"Anime Saimoe Tournament\", which has been organized by members of 2channel every year since 2002. \"Moe\" characters entering within the fiscal year starting July 1 and ending June 30 the following year are eligible. Each tournament has at least 280 \"moe\" characters. Spin-offs of the Saimoe Tournament include RPG Saimoe, which has video game characters, and SaiGAR, a competition between the \"manliest men of anime\". In 2006 and 2007, the Saimoe Tournament became an increasingly international event; 2channel users obliged foreign \"otaku\" by putting up an English version of their rules page. However the contest was discontinued after 2014. The International Saimoe League, also known as ISML, is another online \"moe\" popularity contest that is for a worldwide audience.\n\nMoe contests also exist in magazine publications, and in the real world. The Moe Game Awards are given annually to bishōjo games published that year in various categories, such as background music, character design, fandisc, graphics, and erotic content. They were started in 2006 as the Bishōjo Game Awards, but their name was changed to Moe Game Awards in 2009. It is run by the Japanese game rating board Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS) and is described by them as \"an R18 game industry version of the Academy Awards\". Magazines that have \"moe\" contests in them include the Japanese magazine \"Dengeki Moeoh\" which runs a column called and features the top 10 \"moe\" characters of the month, as determined by reader votes.\n\nThere are various interpretations of the concept of \"moe\", and the subject has been heavily discussed. Psychologist Tamaki Saitō considers the \"moe\" used by \"otaku\" to be the embodiment of their particular kind of sexuality. Saito points out that while \"otaku\" creations fulfill an abnormal impression of sexuality, few \"otaku\" actually apply this impression to real life. He thus argues that \"moe\" is something that sustains the otaku's sexuality within a fictional world, with the fiction itself being their subject of desire and having no need for reality.\n\nOn the other hand, critic Hiroki Azuma rejects Saito's argument as \"too complicated.\" Azuma argues that \"to \"moe\"\" is simply the act of analyzing each of the character's \"moe\" characteristics and expending those characteristics within the mind, and thus differs from mere feelings of empathy. Azuma sees it as an \"otaku\"'s act of satisfying their desires among their limited relations and thus \"animalization,\" simplifying Saito's idea of \"moe\" into the idea of attaining signals of sexual excitement within an isolated environment, and is therefore nothing more than the act of trained animals.\n\nIn contrast, Tooru Honda argues against the idea that \"moe\" is simply \"the act of arousal in response to signals, and thus animalization\" and argues that this interpretation does not allow one to recall the essence of \"moe\". Honda considers \"moe\" to be the act of remembering ideals among the background signals, an act of necessity that arose as the romance rejected by religion continued to be supported by materialism, and thus interprets it as a mental activity relevant to the contexts of mythology and religion. Furthermore, Honda asserts that this \"animalization\" phenomenon only arose after the \"economic bubble\" period of Japan, when people consumed real romance- and sex-like products, and says that since \"moe\" is commonly interpreted to be in competition with the act of searching for romance in real life, it is thus the antithesis of male-dominant machoism. Also, while Saito doesn't distinguish \"moe\" from more violent types of sexual abnormalities and speaks of \"moe\" in the context of \"battle bishojo\" (beautiful girls that fight), Honda on the other hand treats \"moe\" as the polar opposite of the hunter-ish kind of sexuality featuring in more fiendish works like those by Henry Darger.\n\nAnime director Kazuya Tsurumaki defines \"moe\" to be \"the act of filling in missing information about characters on one's own.\" Accepting this view, writer explains that characters are born from human instinct, which is the exact reason why one can be charmed by them much more than one could by real people. Toshio Okada says that while he himself has not fully understood \"moe\", he defines it as not simply being stirred emotionally by beautiful girls, but also as the meta-viewpoint of seeing oneself falling into such a state.\n\nIn \"The Moe Manifesto, Akihabara insider Patrick Galbraith defines \"moe\" as an affective response to fictional characters or representations of them. The applications of this definition are widespread to political, economic, and cultural discourses. For an example in practice, Matthew Brummer describes how Japan's Self Defense Force utilizes popular culture and the \"moe\" that it engenders to shape public perceptions of the military establishment: The Manga Military.\n\n\n\n"}

Toasted ravioli can be found on the menus of many St. Louis restaurants including those of The Hill, a predominantly Italian neighborhood.\n\nMost accounts of the first toasted ravioli can be traced to the Italian neighborhood, known as \"The Hill\", of St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. Many claims have been made as to the original creation of toasted ravioli in the United States. One account attributes it to Oldani's in St. Louis, MO. The restaurant was located where Mama's \"On The Hill\" restaurant is now, on the St. Louis Hill at 2132 Edwards Street. As the story goes, the delicacy was stumbled upon when a ravioli from wholesaler Mama Toscano's was accidentally dropped into the fryer by Chef Fritz. \"Mickey Garagiola, older brother of Major League Baseball Hall-of-Famer Joe Garagiola, was actually at the bar during the mishap and was the first to taste the accidental treat.\" Shortly after, the item began appearing on menus across \"The Hill\" neighborhood of St. Louis. Meanwhile, many chefs on The Hill stake their claims: Another popular claim revolves around Charlie Gitto's \"On The Hill\" restaurant (then known as \"Angelo's\"). According to that tale, in 1947, a chef at Angelo's accidentally dropped the pasta into oil instead of water.\n\nGenerally, some type of meat is wrapped in square ravioli, breaded and deep fried until the pasta shell becomes slightly crispy, dry and golden brown, hence the name. Toasted ravioli is traditionally served with marinara sauce for dipping and parmesan cheese may also be sprinkled on top. Toasted ravioli can be stored pre-made and frozen which allows it to be easily prepared by fry cooks or bar staff without requiring much special skill or training.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1067402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1067402", "title": "Eidgenossenschaft", "text": "Eidgenossenschaft\n\nEidgenossenschaft () is a German word specific to the political history of Switzerland. \nIt translates to \"oath fellowship\" in reference to the \"eternal pacts\" formed between the Eight Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy of the late medieval period, most notably in Swiss historiography being the Rütlischwur between the three founding cantons Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, traditionally dated to 1307. \nIn modern usage, it is the German term used as equivalent with \"Confederation\" in the official name of Switzerland, \"Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\", rendered \"Confédération\" and \"Confederazione\" in French and Italian, respectively. The related adjective, eidgenössisch, officially translated as \"Swiss federal\", is used in the name of organisations, for example the \"Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule\", \"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\".\nThe term Eidgenosse (literally: \"comrade by oath\") refers to the individual members of the \"Eidgenossenschaft\". It is attested as early as 1315, in the Pact of Brunnen (as \"Eitgenoze\"), referring to the\ncantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. The abstract noun \"Eidgenossenschaft\" (mostly contracted to \"eidgnoszschaft\" or \"eidgnoschaft\") is attested in the 15th century.\nIn modern usage, \"Eidgenosse\" is sometimes used (in archaic or ironic usage) for \"Swiss citizen\".\n\nIn a historical context, \"Eidgenossenschaft\" refers to the medieval Swiss Confederacy, which grew from the 13th to the 16th century in central Europe, persisted until 1798 and then evolved into a federal state in the 19th century. When used in this sense, the eternal nature of the pact is necessary—the members of the \"Dreizehn Orte\" (Thirteen Cantons), frequently made time-limited alliances sworn by oath with other partners, but such pacts were not considered an \"Eidgenossenschaft\".\n\nThe members of an \"Eidgenossenschaft\" are called \"Eidgenossen\" (singular \"Eidgenosse\"). This term is documented in an alliance from 1351 between the communal, countrified lieus of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden and the civic city lieus of Lucerne and Zürich, which referred to themselves as such. In the evolution of the Swiss Confederacy, the members initially were not united by one single pact, but rather by a whole set of overlapping pacts and separate bilateral treaties between various members. The abstraction to the singular use of \"Eidgenossenschaft\", which implies a stronger sense of community and the perception of a strong common cause, did not occur until some forty years later, after the Battle of Sempach, although it began already in the \"Pfaffenbrief\" of 1370, a treaty among some of the then eight members of the Swiss Confederacy.\n\nThe communal movement in medieval Europe often led to similar alliances or leagues, called \"conjurationes\" in the Latin of the official documents of the time. The city alliances () in the medieval Holy Roman Empire, in which the member cities also were equal, can be regarded as \"Eidgenossenschaften\", too, although they generally proved less stable, partly due to their fragmented territories. The best known of these city alliances was the Hanseatic League, but many others existed in the 13th and 14th century. An early example is the Lombard League at the time of Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"; an example from Switzerland would be the \"Burgundian Confederacy\" of Bern.\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, emperor Charles IV outlawed any such \"conjurationes, confederationes,\" and \"conspirationes\" in his Golden Bull of 1356. Most \"Städtebünde\" were subsequently dissolved, sometimes forcibly, and where refounded, their political influence was much reduced. On the Swiss \"Eidgenossenschaft\", however, the edict had no such effect as Charles IV, who was of the House of Luxembourg, regarded the Swiss as potential useful allies against his rivals, the Habsburgs.\n\nEquivalent terms in German used for \"oath fellowships\" without specific connection to Switzerland are \"Eidgemeinschaft\" and \"Eidgesellschaft\".\n\"Eidgeselle\" in 16th-century German is used of sworn guild members, of friends privately sworn to one another, and of conjugal spouses.\n"}

It is also called a Maraq/marqa.\n\nFrom Moroccan Arabic طجين \"tažin\", from Arabic طاجن \"tājun\" \"shallow earthen pot\", from \"tagēnon\" \"frying-pan, saucepan\".\n\nThe tagine dates back to Harun al-Rashid, a ruler of the Early Muslim conquests. The earliest writings about the concept of cooking in a tajine appear in the famous \"One Thousand and One Nights\", an Arabic-language story collection from the ninth century. It is also mentioned during the Abbasid Caliphate (which stretched from the Middle East to North Africa and al-Andalus during the ninth century). The dish would have been already famous amongst the nomadic Bedouin people of the Arabian Peninsula, who added dried fruits like dates, apricots and plums to give it its unique taste. Tagine is now often eaten with french fries, either on the top or on the side.\n\nToday, the cooking-pot and its traditional broth is primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa. In North Africa it is called a Tajine, while in the Middle East it is called a \"maraq\" (broth) or a \"qidra\" (cooking pot). There are different ways to prepare the tajine. In the original qidra style \"saman\" (clarified butter) is used to lubricate the surface and a puree of chopped onion is added for flavour and aroma. For \"muqawlli\"-style cooking, the ingredients are placed in olive oil to enrich the flavours.\n\nThere are many descriptions of how to prepare a tajine from Arab scholars. A famous description is the one from ibn al-Adim (1192–1262):\nThe traditional tajine pottery, sometimes painted or glazed, consists of two parts: a circular base unit that is flat with low sides and a large cone- or dome-shaped cover that sits on the base during cooking. The cover is designed to return all condensation to the bottom. That process can be improved by adding cold water into the specially designed well at the top of the lid.\n\nTajine is traditionally cooked over hot charcoal leaving an adequate space between the coals and the tajine pot to avoid having the temperature rise too quickly. Large bricks of charcoal are used, specifically for their ability to stay hot for hours. Other methods are to use a tajine in a slow oven or on a gas or electric stove top, on the lowest heat necessary to keep the stew simmering gently. A diffuser, a circular utensil placed between the tajine and the flame, is used to evenly distribute the stove's heat. European manufacturers have created tajines with heavy cast-iron bottoms that can be heated on a cooking stove to a high temperature, which permits the browning of meat and vegetables before cooking.\n\nTajine cooking may be replicated by using a slow cooker or similar item, but the result will be slightly different. Many ceramic tajines are decorative items as well as functional cooking vessels. Some tajines, however, are intended only to be used as decorative serving dishes.\n\nMoroccan tajine dishes are slow-cooked savory stews, typically made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or fruit. Spices, nuts, and dried fruits are also used. Common spices include ginger, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and saffron. Paprika and chili are used in vegetable tajines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tajine dishes like lamb with dates and spices. Tajines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tajine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is practical in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.\n\nWhat Tunisians refer to as a \"tajine\" is very different from the Moroccan dish. Tunisian tajine is more like an Italian frittata or an eggah. First, a simple ragout is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried rosebuds and ground cinnamon known as \"baharat\" or a robust combination of ground coriander and caraway seeds; this is called tabil. Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include cannellini beans, chickpeas, breadcrumbs or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh parsley, dried mint, saffron, sun-dried tomatoes, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew is baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of lemon. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.\n\nIn rural parts of Tunisia, home cooks place a shallow earthenware dish over olive-wood coals, fill it, cover it with a flat earthenware pan, and then pile hot coals on top. The resulting tajine is crusty on top and bottom, moist within and is infused with a subtle smoky fragrance.\nA similar dish known as \"tavvas\" is found in Cypriot cuisine.\n\n\n"}

Tall dessert glasses are often used to serve.\n\nAlternate versions of the recipe include orange cranachan, cranachan trifle, spiced rum, and shortbread round. For spiced rum cranachan the rum mixture is folded in with whipped cream and placed on top of the shortbread and then the raspberries are added. Whisky-soaked raisins can be used if you do not have raspberries. Chocolate cranachan can be made with chopped toasted hazelnuts, light muscovado sugar and chocolate .\n\n\n \n"}

It is made from top (inside) round, and is lean and tender, with a sweet, musty smell. It originated in Valtellina, a valley in the Alps of northern Italy's Lombardy region.\n\nThe word comes from the diminutive of Lombard \"bresada\" (braised).\n\nA strict trimming process is essential to give the unique flavour. Legs of beef are thoroughly defatted and seasoned with a dry rub of coarse salt and spices, such as juniper berries, cinnamon and nutmeg. They are then left to cure for a few days. A drying period of between one and three months follows, depending on the weight of the particular bresaola. The meat loses up to 40% of its original weight during aging.\n\nIn Valtellina, a similar process is applied to smaller pieces of meat. This produces a more strongly flavoured product, \"slinzega\", which is similar to South African \"biltong\". Traditionally, horse meat was used for \"slinzega\", but now other meats, such as venison and pork, are used, as well.\n\nAs an antipasto, bresaola is usually sliced paper-thin and served at room temperature or slightly chilled. It is most commonly eaten on its own, but may be drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, and served with rocket (rucola, arugula) salad, cracked black pepper, and freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. Bresaola is sometimes confused with carpaccio, which is made from thinly sliced raw beef (the other ingredients are the same). Sliced bresaola should be stored well wrapped in a refrigerator.\n\nThe bresaola produced in Valtellina is now a protected geographical indication (PGI) under EU Regulation 2081/92. Since this designation, dried beef made outside Valtellina may carry a generic name such as \"viande séchée\" or \"beef prosciutto\". There are traditional products from several other areas that are similar:\n\n\n\n"}

Belgian waffles were originally leavened with yeast, but baking powder is now often used. They are often eaten as a breakfast food; toppings vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and chocolate spread, to syrup and butter or margarine. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a dessert.\n\nIn Belgium itself, there are several kinds of waffle, including the Brussels waffle and the Liège waffle.\n\nOriginally showcased in 1958 at Expo 58 in Brussels, Belgian waffles were introduced to North America by a Belgian named Walter Cleyman at the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962, and served with whipped cream and strawberries. The waffles were further popularized in the United States during the 1964 New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, New York City. These waffles were introduced by Maurice Vermersch of Brussels, Belgium. Largely based on a simplified recipe for the Brussels waffles, Vermersch decided to change the name to the Bel-Gem Waffle upon observing that many Americans could not correctly identify Brussels as the capital of Belgium. These waffles were served with whipped cream and strawberries, and they were sold for a dollar.\n"}
{"id": "1069963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1069963", "title": "Skookum", "text": "Skookum\n\nSkookum is a Chinook Jargon word that has historical use in the Pacific Northwest. It has a range of meanings, commonly associated with an English translation of \"strong\" or \"monstrous\". The word can mean \"strong\", \"greatest\", \"powerful\", \"ultimate\", or \"brave\". Something can be \"skookum\", meaning \"strong\" or \"monstrously significant\". When used in reference to another person, \"e.g.\", \"he's skookum\", it conveys connotations of reliability or a monstrous nature, as well as strength, size or hard-working.\n\n\"Skookum house\" means 'jail' or 'prison' (cf. the English euphemism \"the big house\", but here meaning 'strong house'). \"Skookum tumtum\", lit. \"strong heart\", is generally translated as 'brave' or possibly 'good-hearted'. In the Chinook language, \"skookum\" is a verb auxiliary, used similarly to \"can\" or \"to be able\". Another compound, though fallen out of use in modern British Columbia English, is \"skookum lacasset\" or 'strongbox'.\n\n\"Skookumchuck\" means 'turbulent water' or 'rapids in a stream or river', literally 'strong water' (\"chuck\" is Chinook Jargon for 'water', 'stream' or 'lake'). It is a common placename in British Columbia, Washington and Idaho. The term is used for tidal-exchange rapids at the mouths of inlets and bays, a regular feature of the Inside Passage, especially Skookumchuck Narrows.\n\nA \"skookum\" is a variety of mountain giant or monster similar to the Sasquatch or Bigfoot. In the surviving Chinuk-Wawa spoken in Grand Ronde, Oregon, this variant is pronounced differently—\"skoo-KOOM\"—but when used in English with this meaning, it is pronounced the same way as the \"big and strong\" meaning.\n\nSkookums were bad spirits or devils of which crows, eagles, owls, blue jays, various beasts and reptiles could be representations. They could inhabit people and cause serious illness.\n\nA derivative usage of the skookum-as-monster context was the application of the name to a souvenir Skookum doll, sometimes simply called \"a skookum\". Mary McAboy first started making Skookum dolls in 1913 and received a patent for them in 1914. They were popular from the early 1920s until the 1960s. They were factory-made dolls that resembled Native American people and were sold to tourists at trading posts in the western United States.\n\nEarly dolls heads were made of dried apples with the bodies made of wood and stuffed with either leaves, straw, twigs or grass stuffed in a muslin sack. Later the dolls were made from composition and had mohair wigs. Later dolls were made of plastic and had plastic brown shoes. They have \"Indian style\" blankets as part of their attire. Some had jewelry such as beaded necklaces or earrings. Some dolls have feathered headdresses. The sizes of the dolls ranged from babies inside of cradle boards to large, human size store display dolls. The rule of thumb is the larger the doll, the more valuable/rare they are. The most common sizes range from about seven inches to about 12 inches tall. Skookums were widely imitated. Minnetonka, Milbros or Minnehaha dolls are similar, but not the same. Most Skookum dolls were made so they look to the right. Skookums do not have arms: they are wrapped with blankets and have the suggestion of arms. Skookums never have gray hair, as in \"elders\". Skookums should have the words \"Skookum\" either stamped on their brown plastic shoes or a tag with \"Skookum\" on their foot in the case of the older versions.\n\nSkookum, either alone or in the combination skookumchuck, occurs in dozens of placenames throughout the Pacific Northwest region and beyond. A short form used with personal names, \"Skook\", is found on the map of British Columbia at Mount Skook Davidson near the confluence of the Kechika and Gataga Rivers in northern British Columbia and Mount Skook Jim, near the head of the Stein River in the northern Lillooet Ranges between Pemberton and Lytton. Local lore in any area of British Columbia may have a Skookum Charlie or a Skookum Brown; the most famous of such nicknames was that of Skookum Jim, one of the co-discoverers of the Klondike goldfields in the Yukon. It is also the name given to a 1909 Baldwin 2-4-4-2 Mallet type logging locomotive.\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes used as a baby teething food. In the United Kingdom, the name also refers to a wheat-based food additive.\n\nRusk is called sukhary () in Azerbaijani. It is usually (but not always) made from a stale bread and buns. In Baku, some bakeries use their stale buns and bread for making rusks. The price of rusk in those bakeries is usually low, as the bakeries do this to avoid wasting the leftover bread and buns.\n\n\"Sponge rusk\" is similar to biscotti but it is made out of twice-baked yellow cake batter. The yellow cake batter is baked into a flat, rectangular cake pan; once it is baked and cooled off, it is sliced into strips and baked again or toasted to make a cake toast. It is usually eaten with Cuban coffee (Cuban espresso) or as an accompaniment to ice cream, custard, or other dessert dishes.\n\n\"Tvebak\" is a Danish type of rusk.\n\nA \"biscotte\" is a French type of rusk. They are sold packaged in supermarkets.\n\nA Finnish type of rusk is called \"korppu\", usually a dried piece of bun, flavored with cinnamon and sugar. \"Korppu\" is a common coffee bread, normally eaten after having been dipped in coffee. A sour version, called \"hapankorppu\", is a flat rusk made from rye flour and salt, and can be eaten like bread.\n\n\"Zwieback\" (literally \"twice baked\") is a form of rusk eaten in Germany. Like the Danish and French words, the name refers to being baked or cooked twice.\n\nThe term \"paximadi\" () covers various forms of Greek rusk, made commonly from barley or chickpea flour, and softened with wine, water or oil before eating. \"Paximadi\" form the basis of the Cretan snack \"dakos\" ().\n\nIn India rusk (or toast biscuit) is a traditional dried bread. It is also known as papay, \"khasta\" (Hindi: खस्ता), \"russ\" or \"cake rusk\" in Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu or \"katti toos\" in Bengali. It is usually eaten during tea time with milky tea which softens the rusk.\nThe rusk originated from Persia around the 7th century and is common throughout north India and some parts of the south.\n\nIn Pakistan, It is known as \"russ\" (Urdu: رس) or \"cake rusk\". It is mostly found in large round biscuit shapes (russ), but also comes in long rectangular shapes (cake rusk). It is usually eaten in breakfast with milk tea. Sometimes also called Papay (Urdu: پاپے)\n\nIn Iran, rusk is called \"nān-e sokhāri\" (Persian: نان سوخاری). It is made from wheat flour, sugar, skimmed milk powder, vegetable oil, gluten, malt extract, soy flour, salt, yeast, and water. It is eaten as a dunking biscuit, particularly with Persian chai (tea). The most common brand of \"naan sukhaari\" is Vitana.\n\nIn Italy, this form is called fette biscottate; it should not be confused with \"biscotti\" (twice-baked cookies or biscuits).\n\nIn Japan, rusk is often a delicacy made from baguette, cake or even croissant. It is often sweet.\n\nIn the Levant this form is called \"boksum\" (Arabic: ) in Iraq and Syria or \"qurshalla\" (Arabic:قرشلة) in Jordan. It is made from flour, eggs, oil or butter, sugar, yeast or baking powder, and sometimes a small amount of cardamon. It is topped with roasted sesame seeds, black caraway seeds, or anise, and eaten as a dunking biscuit, especially with herbal tea.\n\n\"Beschuit\", also known as Dutch crispbakes, are light, round, rather crumbly, rusks as eaten in the Netherlands and Belgium. Particularly in the Netherlands it is customary to serve \"beschuit met muisjes\" (sprinkled with \"little mice\" which are anise seeds covered in white, pink or blue sugar; note that \"muisjes\" can be thought of as miniature \"sugar plums\") at the birth of a baby. \"Beschuiten\" are also eaten as a breakfast food with a variety of toppings, most commonly butter and sprinkles in flavours such as chocolate (\"chocoladehagel\" or \"chocolademuisjes\") or fruit (\"vruchtenhagel\"), or cheese. A longtime Dutch tradition is to serve strawberries on \"beschuit\" usually topped with some sugar or whipped cream.\n\n\"Beschuit\" is almost always sold in rolls; a roll typically has 13 rusks (a baker's dozen). They are made by first baking a flat round bread (\"beschuitbol\"), slicing it, and then baking each half again, possibly at a lower heat, in the oven after the main baking is over. Etymologically, \"biscotto\" (16th-century Italian), biscuit (19th century, from 16th-century \"bisket\") and \"beschuit\" come from Latin \"(panis)\" \"bis\"+\"coctus\", (bread, twice cooked).\n\nIn Norway, rusk is referred to as \"kavring\", and is similar to the Swedish \"skorpor\". Crushed kavring, called \"strøkavring\", is used, amongst other things, for making \"kjøttkaker\" and in the traditional dessert \"tilslørte bondepiker\". Kavring is also broken up and can be served with regular, soured or cultured milk.\n\nThe Philippine version of rusk is called \"biscocho\". Cake rusks are called \"mamon tostado\".\n\nIn Portuguese, rusk is called \"tosta\". \"Tosta\" word means a hard, biscuit-textured slice of bread - it can be sweet, but most often it is savory. It can have various shapes and thicknesses. When ground, it is called \"pão ralado\", literally \"ground bread\" and has various culinary uses.\n\nThe Russian version is called \"sookhar' \" (Cyrillic: сухарь). They are either baked a second time from sweet challah-like bread, sliced in biscotti fashion or just made of leftover stale bread, cut into small cubes and air-dried or baked at a very low temperature. The first one is like a cookie, good with milk, kefir, tea, coffee or cacao. The second one is usually added to soup, clear or otherwise, softening up from absorbed liquids and accompanying it instead of bread. It became a tradition in order not to waste any leftover bread that always was a staple in Russian cuisine, was hard labored for, and respected for thousands of years. There is a lot of folklore and sayings about bread in Russian language, paying due respect to this grain food that is one of the cornerstones of Slavic nations' life and history.\n\nRusks is the anglicized term for \"beskuit\" and is a traditional Afrikaner breakfast meal or snack. They have been dried in South Africa since the late 1690s as a way of preserving bread, especially when travelling long distances without refrigeration. Their use continued through the Great Trek and the Boer Wars through to the modern day. Rusks are typically dunked in coffee or tea before being eaten.\n\nRusks are essentially double-baked bread dough. Round balls of dough are closely packed in pans and baked like bread, after which long chunks are cut or broken off and slowly rebaked to a dry consistency. Several modern-day, mass-produced versions are available, the most famous brand being \"Ouma Rusks\". Many bakeries, delis and home industries also sell commercial rusks, sometimes made from non-traditional ingredients, such as baking powder rather than sourdough. In addition to plain and buttermilk flavours, aniseed, wholewheat, condensed milk, muesli, and lemon poppyseed variations are also available.\n\n\"Skorpor\" (plural; singular \"skorpa\") are a Swedish form of rusk. They can be flavoured with herbs, dried fruit, nuts, or spices such as anise or cardamom. Swedish bakery company Pågen makes the world's most-sold rusk brand, Krisprolls.\n\nIn Turkish, rusk is called \"peksimet\". \"Pek\" word means solid, tight, durable in Turkish and \"simet/simit\" is Arabic word [سميد] means bread/flour. Another name is \"galeta\", a loanword from Catalan.\n\nTo the British, butcher rusk is a dry biscuit broken into particles, sorted by particle size and sold to butchers and others for use as a food additive in sausage manufacture. Though originally made from stale bread, now called \"bread-rusk,\" a yeast-free variety called simply \"rusk\" is now more commonly used.\n\nVarious rusk particle sizes are used in the food industry, where uses include:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Farley's Rusks are a dry biscuit dating from the 1880s, but manufactured by Heinz since 1994. They are usually given to infants, either soaked in milk and mashed up or in their original hard form as a teething aid.\n\nIn 2006, a short-lived scare was caused when some Farley's Rusks were found to contain traces of the weedkiller chlorpropham. The affected products were recalled and the contamination was traced to a batch of flour used during the manufacturing process. The level of contamination was not high enough to be considered a health risk.\n\nIn the US, commonly available types of rusk include melba toast, which is sold packaged in grocery stores, and biscotti, which are found both at grocery stores and at coffee shops or cafes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1070307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1070307", "title": "Fitna (word)", "text": "Fitna (word)\n\nFitna (or , pl. \"; : \"temptation, trial; sedition, civil strife\") is an Arabic word with extensive connotations of trial, affliction, or distress. A word with important historical implications, it is also widely used in modern Arabic.\n\nOne might distinguish between the meanings of \" as used in Classical Arabic and the meanings of \"fitna\" as used in Modern Standard Arabic and various colloquial dialects. Due to the conceptual importance of \"fitna\" in the Qur'an, its use in that work may need to be considered separately from, though in addition to, the word's general lexical meaning in Classical Arabic.\n\nAside from its use in the Qur'an, \"fitna\" is used as term for the four heavy civil wars within the Islamic Caliphate from the 7th to the 9th century AD.\n\nArabic, in common with other Semitic languages like Hebrew, employs a system of root letters combined with vowel patterns to constitute its whole range of vocabulary. As such, identification of the root letters of any word might bring a better understanding the word's full semantic range.\n\n\"Fitna\" has the triliteral root \"fā'-tā'-nūn\" (). In addition to the feminine noun \"fitna\", \"fitan\", this root forms, in particular, a Form I active verb \"fatana\", \"yaftinu\" (), a Form I passive verb \"futina\", \"yuftanu\" (), a Form I maṣdar \"futūn\" (), a Form I active participle \"fātin\" (), a Form I passive participle \"maftūn\" (), and so on.\n\nLane, in his monumental \"Arabic-English Lexicon\" compiled from various traditional Arabic lexicographical sources available in Cairo in the mid-19th-century, reported that \"to burn\" is the \"primary signification\" of the verb. The verb then came to be applied to the smelting of gold and silver. It was extended to mean causing one to enter into fire and into a state of punishment or affliction. Thus, one says that something caused one to enter \"al-fitna\", i.e. trial, affliction, etc., or more generally, an affliction whereby some good or evil quality is put to the test. Lane glosses the noun \"fitna\" as meaning a trial, a probation, affliction, distress or hardship, and says that \"the sum total of its meaning in the language of the Arabs\" is an affliction whereby one is tried, proved or tested.\n\nThe definitions offered by Lane match those suggested by Badawi and Haleem in their dictionary of Qur'anic usage. They gloss the triliteral root as having the following meanings: \"to purify gold and silver by smelting them; to burn; to put to the test, to afflict (in particular as a means of testing someone's endurance); to disrupt the peace of a community; to tempt, to seduce, to allure, to infatuate.\"\n\nThe meanings of \"fitna\" as found in Classical Arabic largely carry over into Modern Standard Arabic, as evidenced by the recitation of the same set of meanings in Hans Wehr's \"Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic\". In addition, Wehr glosses the noun \"fitna\" as also meaning \"charm, charmingness, attractiveness; enchantment, captivation, fascination, enticement, temptation; infatuation, intrigue; sedition, riot, discord, dissension, civil strife.\"\n\nBuckwalter & Parkinson, in their frequency dictionary of Arabic, list the noun \"fitna\" as the 1,560th most frequent word in their corpus of over 30 million words from Modern Standard Arabic and colloquial Arabic dialects. They gloss \"fitna\" as meaning \"charm, allure, enchantment; unrest; riot, rebellion.\"\n\nThe first Quran verse about Fitna was supposedly revealed during the Nakhla Raid. After his return from the first Badr encounter (Battle of Safwan), Muhammad sent Abdullah ibn Jahsh in Rajab with 12 men on a fact-finding operation. Abdullah ibn Jahsh was a maternal cousin of Muhammad. He took along with him Abu Haudhayfa, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, Ukkash ibn Mihsan, Utba b. Ghazwan, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, Amir ibn Rabia, Waqid ibn Abdullah and Khalid ibn al-Bukayr.\nMuhammad gave Abdullah ibn Jahsh a letter, but not to be read until he had traveled for two days and then to do what he was instructed to do in the letter without putting pressure on his companions. Abdullah proceeded for two days, then he opened the letter; it told him to proceed until he reached Nakhla, between Mecca and Taif, to lie in wait for the Quraysh, and to observe what they were doing.\n\nWhile the Quraysh were busy preparing food, the Muslims attacked. In the short battle that took place, Waqid ibn Abdullah killed Amr ibn Hadrami, the leader of the Quraysh caravan, with an arrow. The Muslims captured two Quraysh tribe members. Nawfal ibn Abdullah managed to escape. The Muslims took Uthman ibn Abdullah and al-Hakam ibn Kaysan as captives. Abdullah ibn Jahsh returned to Medina with the booty and with the two captured Quraysh tribe members. The followers planned to give one-fifth of the booty to Muhammad.\n\nMuhammad initially disapproved of that act and suspended any action as regards the camels and the two captives on account of the prohibited months . The Arab pagans exploited this opportunity to accuse the Muslims of violating what is divinely inviolable (fighting in the months considered sacred to the Arab pagans). This idle talk brought about a painful headache for Muhammad's Companions, until at last they were relieved when Muhammad revealed a verse regarding fighting in the sacred months\nAccording to Ibn Qayyim, he said \"most of the scholars have explained the word Fitnah here as meaning Shirk\"\n\nThe Muslim Mufassir Ibn Kathir's commentary on this verse in his book Tafsir ibn Kathir is as follows:\nmeans, trying to force the Muslims to revert from their religion and re-embrace Kufr after they had believed, is worse with Allah than killing.' Allah said:\n\nBadawi & Haleem note that the triliteral root \"fā'-tā'-nūn\" () occurs in 6 different forms a total of 60 times in the Qur'an. In particular, it appears 34 times as a noun and 26 times in various verbal forms. Bakhtiar's concordance of the Qur'an confirms Badawi & Haleem's numbers, although Bakhtiar further breaks down the appearance of each verbal form by distinguishing active and passive verbs by tense as well. The following table sets out the details; note that since the root only appears as a verb in Form I forms, that is assumed.\n\nThe triliteral root \"fā'-tā'-nūn\" (), as noted above, bears a range of significations, even in the Qur'an itself. The Qur'anic appearances of the root are explored below (in no particular order).\n\n\"Fitna\" as persecution appears in several of the verses commanding Muslims to fight the unbelievers (specifically referring to the Meccan polytheists who had persecuted Muhammad and his early followers, thus leading to the \"hijra\"). For example, in Qur'an , the command to fight is justified on the grounds that \"persecution (\"al-fitnatu\") is worse than slaying.\" Similarly, in Qur'an , Muslims are forbidden from fighting unbelievers around the Holy Mosque in Mecca unless the unbelievers attack first, in which case Muslims are to fight \"until there is no persecution (\"fitnatun\") and the religion is God's.\" The \"hijra\" is mentioned in Qur'an as having occurred because of the persecution believers had suffered in Mecca. Other examples are Qur'an , which promises the chastisement of Hell for those who have persecuted Muslims, and Qur'an , which provides that one's daily required prayer may be shortened if, when on a journey, one fears that the unbelievers may attack if one remains in a place long enough to complete the full prayer.\n\nIn Qur'an , the Qur'an itself is described as having \"clear revelations – they are the substance of the Book – and others (which are) allegorical,\" and then the Qur'an characterizes those who are unsteady and who do not have firm faith as desiring dissension in the community through their pursuit of interpretations of the \"allegorical\" verses of the Qur'an. A set of occurrences of the root related to dissension or sedition occurs in Quran , where those who say they are believers, but show themselves reluctant to follow certain of God's commands, are described as seeking \"sedition\" among the community.\n\nMany instances of the root as \"trial\" appear throughout the Qur'an. This sense of the root bears the further sense of a \"tribulation\" or \"difficulty\" in such verses as, for example: Qur'an , where Moses, after killing a man in Egypt, was \"tried with a heavy trial\" by being forced to flee and to live among the Midians for many years; and Qur'an , where some believers are characterized as worshipping God \"upon a narrow marge,\" since they are happy so long as their life is relatively secure and easy, but as soon as they experience a trial, they turn away from God.\n\nHowever, the root in other verses carries a sense of \"trial\" as simply a kind of test of a person's commitment to their faith (without necessarily implying that the testing results from something bad happening, as the sense of trial as \"tribulation\" might bear). For example, Qur'an says, in part, \"And even so do We try some of them by others.\" Things widely recognized as good things in life may serve as trials, as Qur'an and make clear by describing one's own wealth and children as trials. Qur'an also carries this sense of trial by something good; there, God's own \"boon\" (or \"blessing\") is described as a trial for certain people. Again, in Qur'an , God will give those idolaters who decide to \"tread the right path\" an abundance of good \"that We may test them thereby,\" to see whether they will turn away from God once they have obtained his favor or whether they will be steadfast in faith.\n\nTrials may also result from things revealed by God that some may find difficult to accept. For example, Qur'an describes the revelation of the \"Cursed Tree\" as \"an ordeal for mankind.\" Another example of this sense is Qur'an , where the number of the angels who guard the Fire has been \"made a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve ... and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude?\"\n\nThe root also bears the sense of \"temptation,\" as in Qur'an , where those who were hypocritical in their faith will be turned away and told by the steadfast believers, from whom they are separated, \"ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah.\" In Qur'an , Aaron is said to have warned the Israelites, when Moses had left them to meet with God for forty days, that the Golden Calf was only something they were being tempted by (or, in Pickthall's translation, \"seduced with\"). Harut and Marut warn the people of Babylon, in Qur'an , \"We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not,\" although the warning proved to be ineffective for some.\n\nAside from its use in the Qur'an, \"fitna\" came to have a primary sense of \"'revolt', 'disturbances', 'civil war', but a civil war that breeds schism and in which the believers' purity of faith is in grave danger.\" This was especially so as it came, in the term First Fitna, to refer to the first major civil war of the Islamic Caliphate, which lasted from 656 to 661. \"On account of the struggles that marked Mu'āwiya's advent, the term \"fitna\" was later applied to any period of disturbances inspired by schools or sects that broke away from the majority of believers.\" The term thus appears the descriptions of other major conflicts such as the Second Fitna (680–92), the Third Fitna (744–47), the Fourth Fitna (809-827), and the Fitna of al-Andalus (1009–1031).\n\n\n"}

Christopher Columbus devoted a complete page to what a wonderful time it would be when he would be able to gorge himself on figs in the orient, while Marco Polo described women in association with the beauty of figs. It was also during this period that figs reached America, when the Spanish reached the island of Hispaniola in 1520.\n\nIn the UK the biscuit is made by McVities, Jacob's, and Bolands. During the mid 1990's Jacob's produced a limited edition of a Chocolate version of the biscuit.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, many physicians believed that most illnesses were related to digestion problems, and therefore recommended a daily intake of biscuits and fruit. Although an ideal solution for this problem, until this time fig rolls were still a locally made and hand-produced product.\n\nThe mass production of the fig roll was created in 1891 by Philadelphia baker and fig lover Charles Roser, who, in 1892, was awarded a patent for a machine which inserted fig creme into a cake-like dough: classical fig rolls are encased in a more pastry-like covering, creating a chewy experience. Naming his product “Newtons” after the local town of Newton, Massachusetts, he approached the Cambridgeport, Massachusetts based Kennedy Biscuit Company, who agreed to take on production and sales.\n\nKennedy Biscuit Company had recently become associated with the New York Biscuit Company, and after merger to form Nabisco, trade marked the product as the Fig Newton.\n\nNow a trademarked product of Nabisco, the unusual shape of Fig Newtons is a characteristic that has been adopted by many competitors, such as the generic fig bars sold by most supermarkets, and Newman's Own Fig Newmans (an organic variety).\n\nThe Britannia Industries in India produces Fig Rolls.\n\n\n"}

The chocolate bar is typically chilled before battering to prevent it from melting into the frying fat, despite a cold Mars bar being able to fracture when heated.\n\nThe dish originated at chip shops in Scotland as a novelty item, but was never mainstream. Since various mass media began reporting on the practice in the mid-1990s, in part as a commentary on urban Scotland's notoriously unhealthy diet, the popularity of the dish has spread. The product has not received support from Mars, Inc., who said \"deep-frying one of our products would go against our commitment to promoting healthy, active lifestyles.\"\n\nThe creation of the dish is attributed to John Davie who invented the sweet treat in 1992 in the Haven Chip Bar (now the Carron) in Stonehaven, near Aberdeen on Scotland's northeast coast.\n\nThe first recorded mention of the food was in the \"Aberdeen Evening Express\", following a tip off phone call to their journalist Alastair Dalton that a chip shop in Stonehaven had been deep frying Mars Bars for local children. The article included a quote from Mars spokesperson who said this was the first time they had heard of this being done with their product. The following day the story was picked up and run in the \"Daily Record\", August 24, 1995, in an article titled \"Mars supper, please\". Scottish broadsheets \"The Herald\" and \"Scotsman\" ran the story the following day and the UK broadsheets the day after, each adding their own cultural slant. On the fifth day Keith Chegwin performed taste tests on \"The Big Breakfast\" TV program and the story was covered by the BBC World Service.\n\nIn July 2015, Aberdeenshire Council instructed the proprietors of the Carron Fish Bar to remove a banner advertising the shop as the origin of the product. The council wished to \"improve the look of Stonehaven\". However, the proprietors have refused to remove the banner.\n\nAfter the food was mentioned in 2004 by Jay Leno on NBC's \"Tonight Show\" in the United States, \"The Lancet\" commissioned the University of Dundee in June 2004 to validate the association between Scotland and the deep-fried Mars bar.\n\nAfter undertaking a telephone questionnaire survey of 627 fish and chip shops in Scotland, the results published in December 2004 attempted to discover how available the deep-fried Mars bar was, and if people were actually buying them. The survey found:\n\nIn 2012, the Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven (formerly called the Haven) which began the craze, estimated sales of 100150 deep-fried Mars bars per week, but that 70% were sold to visitors who have heard of its reputation.\n\nIn 2000, Scottish chef Ross Kendall included the bars on the menu of \"Le Chipper\" restaurant in Paris.\n\nThe deep-fried Mars bar has also given rise to the frying of other confections, for example, Reiver's Fish Bar in Duns annually advertises an Easter special of deep-fried Creme Egg, although this is available all year. Deep-fried Snickers have also been reported, particularly in the United States where the Mars bar is not common; it is popular at state fairs and similar events. In her book and television series \"Nigella Bites\", Nigella Lawson includes a recipe for a deep-fried Bounty bar. Deep-fried Moro bars are also sold in New Zealand, where the brand is popular.\n\nSince it was first reported in the media in August 1995, when the \"Daily Record\" ran an article entitled \"Scotland's craziest takeaway\", the deep-fried Mars bar has become a symbol for ill health, obesity and high-fat diets. The original article was quickly followed up by other UK publications, with the food portrayed to speak eloquently about Scotland's and the wider UK's poor diet, and resultant levels of obesity.\n\nIn 2012, the Haven sought an application for secured status under the EU's Protected Food Name Scheme. But Mars wrote to the fish bar asking it to make plain that deep-frying of the bars was \"not authorised or endorsed\" by Mars, and an agreed disclaimer statement was put up in both the shop and in its menu.\n\nThe deep fried Mars bar was one outcome factor amongst many theories behind the \"Glasgow effect\", whereby the city has a notedly higher mortality rate than many cities of the same size and scale. One theory suggested that its residents have a naturally pessimistic disposition, and that eating unhealthy food was an example of their tendency to put \"a lower price on the future\". In a 2012 interview, Glasgow restaurateur John Quigley felt that Scotland had been trying to \"shake off\" its unhealthy image for 20 years, since the media coverage of the deep-fried Mars bar.\n\n\n"}

It has a yellowish-green color imparted by Tartrazine. Among soft drinks, it is known for its high caffeine content (63 mg per 12 oz can, 9 mg higher than a 12 oz can of Mountain Dew, but not as much as Vault with 70.5 mg per 12 oz can). Orange juice is an ingredient in the drink, and remaining pulp matter from the orange juice provides some of the soft drink's taste and appearance.\n\nSun Drop was developed in Missouri, by Charles Lazier, a salesman of beverage concentrates. While riding around town in the family car, Lazier quickly scribbled a recipe for a new soft drink on a small piece of paper which he handed to his son, Charles Jr. The younger Lazier worked as a lab technician at his father’s plant, and soon began work on the formula. Two years later, Sun Drop Cola debuted at the American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages Conference in Washington, D.C. The Sun Drop formula was patented on April 15, 1930.\nThe drink was marketed in several Southern states under names such as \"Sundrop Golden Cola\" or \"Golden Girl Cola.\" The brand was acquired and standardized by Crush International in 1970. Crush International was purchased by Procter & Gamble in 1980, which sold its soft drinks holdings to Cadbury Schweppes plc in 1989. Cadbury Schweppes plc demerged in 2008, with its beverages unit becoming Keurig Dr Pepper, which currently produces Sun Drop.\nPrior to the sale to Cadbury Schweppes, Procter & Gamble introduced several new Sun Drop flavors in 1985, including a reformulated Diet Sun Drop brand using aspartame instead of saccharin. A third brand, Cherry-Lemon Sun Drop, was introduced that same year. In February 2002, the brand introduced Caffeine-Free Sun Drop to the portfolio after the company received numerous requests from loyal consumers for a caffeine-free version of their favorite citrus soft drink. A diet variant of Cherry Lemon Sun Drop was introduced 2014.\n\nSun Drop has maintained popularity in many parts of the southern United States, especially in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina and parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and western Minnesota. Similar to other regional drinks with a cult following, fans outside bottling areas have been known to pay large amounts to have the drink shipped to them. Families have sent it to U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan.\n\nSun Drop is sometimes used as a mixer for drinks with hard liquor.\n\nSun Drop is the official drink of the nationally recognized \"Fancy Farm Picnic\" in Fancy Farm, Kentucky.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, the drink was promoted in the American South by NASCAR Winston Cup driver Dale Earnhardt.\n\nCarolina Beverage Corp. bought Sun Drop Bottling Co. of Concord effective December 1, 2016. The Concord, North Carolina plant closed.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper distributed Sun Drop nationwide beginning in 2011, with a new campaign that features an updated web site, a Facebook page, and a promotional deal with MTV. The Sun Drop marketing plan is a component of Dr Pepper Snapple's efforts to expand its non-cola soda sales and is targeting drinkers of PepsiCo's Mountain Dew brand of soft drinks in the United States. Sun Drop's expansion occurred several months after Coca-Cola brought its high-caffeine citrus drink Mello Yello nationwide.\n\nDr Pepper Snapple entered into an agreement with MTV's marketing agency, Scratch. Scratch will develop new Sun Drop advertising and branding, including a new design for the can. MTV will also feature Sun Drop in programming, including on its reality series \"The Real World\".\n\nThe soft drink was a leading sponsor for racecar driver Ryan Hunter-Reay in the IndyCar Series for Andretti Autosport from 2011 to 2013.\n\nThere are six varieties of the drink:\n\nSun Drop that is bottled in glass bottles is typically sweetened with sugar instead of corn syrup, providing a slightly different taste.\n\n"}

The sandwich's history dates back at least to the 1930s. The bread itself is, at the diner's preference, often dipped (or double-dipped) into the jus the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style giardiniera (called \"hot\") or sauteed, green Italian sweet peppers (called \"sweet\").\n\nItalian beef sandwiches are commonly found at many area hot dog stands, pizzerias and Italian-American restaurants in northeastern Illinois, southeast Wisconsin (notably Kenosha), Northwest Indiana, Fort Wayne, and Indianapolis. In recent years, Chicago expatriates have opened restaurants across the country serving Italian beef.\n\nItalian beef is made using cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which contributes to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result in as much as a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.\n\nThe exact origin is unknown, but many believe it was created by Italian immigrants who worked for Chicago's old Union Stock Yards in the early 1900s. They often would bring home some of the tougher, less desirable cuts of beef sold by the company. To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted to make it more tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor. Both the roasting and the broth used Italian-style spices and herbs. The meat was then thinly sliced across the grain and stuffed into fresh Italian bread.\n\nAccording to Scala's Original Beef and Sausage Company (formed in 1925), this meal was originally introduced at weddings and banquets where the meat was sliced thinly so there would be enough to feed all the guests. It rapidly grew in popularity and eventually became one of Chicago's most famous ethnic foods: the original Italian beef sandwich.\n\nThe recipe was popularized by Pasquale Scala, and a group of his associates who started small beef stands in Chicago and used similar recipes, perfecting Chicago’s original Italian beef sandwich. Al Ferreri and his sister and brother-in-law, Frances and Chris (Baba) Pacelli, founded of Al’s Beef in 1938, and Mr. Beef on Orleans co-founders Carl Bonavolanto Jr. and his Tony (\"Uncle Junior\" to the Buonavolantos) Ozzauto each set up shop.\n\nOther Italian beef purveyors likewise set up shop in the 40s, many obtaining their beef from Scala Packing Company of Chicago.\nChris Pacelli (Baba) (founder of Al’s Beef in 1938), Carl Bonavolanto Jr. and Tony Ozzauto (co-founders, Mr. Beef on Orleans in 1961), were among the group.\n\nBy 1954, a local restaurant Al's Beef was advertising its \"Pizza, Spaghetti, Ravioli, [and] Italian Beef Sandwiches\" in the Chicago Tribune.\nMr. Beef’s founder helped his brother, Joe Buonavolanto, open one of the first Italian beef stands outside of the city limits.\n\nThere are varying degrees of juiciness, depending on taste. Nomenclature varies from stand to stand, but \"wet\" or \"dipped\" means the bread is quickly dunked in the juice; \"juicy\" even wetter; and \"soaked\" is dripping wet.\n\nMost Chicago beef restaurants also offer a \"combo,\" adding a grilled Italian sausage to the sandwich. Different eateries offer hot or mild sausage, or both.\n\nTypical beef orders are:\n\n\nSome order the \"triple double,\" which consists of double cheese, double sausage and double beef. Other even less common variations include substituting Italian bread with a large croissant or topping with marinara sauce.\n\nThe Italian beef sandwich was featured in a late 2008 episode of the Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food\", when host Adam Richman (who focused his restaurant visits on Chicago in that episode) visited Al's No. 1 Italian Beef to try the signature sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich was mentioned in the 1999 History Channel documentary \"American Eats: History on a Bun\" as an example of the specialty sandwiches found in different cities in the United States. Chris Pacelli, owner of Al's No. 1 Italian Beef, is shown demonstrating how to eat the sandwich with the \"Italian stance.\"\n\nAl's Beef was also featured on \"Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America\" in 2012, where Richman declared the Italian beef sandwich the best sandwich in the Midwest.\n\nThe 30 Rock episode \"Sandwich Day\" features \"secret\" sandwiches with dipping sauce from an unknown Italian delicatessen in Brooklyn. It has been theorised that this sandwich is based on the roast beef sandwich from an Italian delicatessen in Hoboken, New Jersey, which appears to be an Italian beef sandwich.\n\n"}

It is still strongly associated with the New York City region.

Ritually-acceptable challah is made of dough from which a small portion has been set aside as an offering. \n\nThe word is Biblical in origin. Similar braided breads – such as kalach, kalács, kolach, or colac – are found in Eastern Europe, though it is not clear whether these influenced or were influenced by the traditional Ashkenazic challah.\n\nThe term \"challah\" originally refers to the mitzvah of separating a portion of the dough before braiding. This portion of dough is set aside as a tithe for the Kohen. In Hebrew, this commandment is called \"hafrashat challah\", or \"separating challah\". This obligation (sometimes called \"taking challah\") applies to any loaf of bread, not only to the Sabbath bread. The word \"challah\" is also used to refer to a specific type of bread loaf.\n\nThe word \"challah\" likely comes from the Hebrew root \"halal\". The etymology of this root is uncertain. It may originally have indicated roundness (\"circle\") and then also came to denote hollowness (\"space\"), or vice versa. It also connotes \"let go\" of something, to put space between things, (as the dough is taken from the family bread dough, and \"let go\" to the priests. It is also now known as \"cholla\" bread. The bread was adopted by bakers in Poland and Russian Empire and is known as \"chałka\" (diminutive of \"chała\") in Poland and \"khala\" (хала) in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nYiddish communities in different regions of Europe called the bread \"khale\", \"berkhes\" or \"barches\", \"bukhte\", \"dacher\", \"kitke\", \"koylatch\" or \"koilitsh\", or \"shtritsl\". Some of these names are still in use today, such as \"kitke\" in South Africa.\n\nThe term \"koylatch\" is cognate with the names of similar braided breads which are consumed on special occasions by other cultures outside of the Jewish tradition in a number of European cuisines. These are the Russian and Ukrainian \"kalach\", the Serbian \"kolač\", the Hungarian \"kalács\", and the Romanian \"colac\". These names originated from Proto-Slavic \"kolo\" meaning \"circle\", or \"wheel\", and refer to the circular form of the loaf.\n\nMost traditional Ashkenazi challah recipes use numerous eggs, fine white flour, water, sugar, yeast, and salt, but \"water challah\" made without eggs and having a texture not unlike French baguettes also exists. Modern recipes may replace white flour with whole wheat, oat, or spelt flour or sugar with honey or molasses.\n\nAmong Sephardic Jews, water challah is preferred for ritual purposes, because Sephardic minhag does not require the dough offering to be separated if the dough contains eggs or sugar. While breads very similar to Ashkenazi egg challah are found in Sephardic cuisine, they are typically not referred to as challah but considered variants of regional breads like çörek, eaten by Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\nEgg challah sometimes also contains raisins and/or saffron. After the first rising, the dough is rolled into rope-shaped pieces which are braided, though local (hands in Lithuania, fish or hands in Tunisia) and seasonal (round, sometimes with a bird's head in the center) varieties also exist. Poppy or sesame (Ashkenazi) and anise or sesame (Sephardic) seeds may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top. Both egg and water challah are usually brushed with an egg wash before baking to add a golden sheen.\n\nChallah is usually parve (containing neither dairy nor meat—important in the laws of Kashrut), unlike brioche and other enriched European breads, which contain butter or milk.\n\nIsraeli challah contains eggs or olive oil in the dough as well as water, sugar, yeast, salt, honey and raisins.\nIt is topped with sesame.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the three Sabbath meals (Friday night, Saturday lunch, and Saturday late afternoon) and two holiday meals (one at night and lunch the following day) each begin with two complete loaves of bread. This \"double loaf\" (in Hebrew: \"lechem mishneh\") commemorates the manna that fell from the heavens when the Israelites wandered in the desert after the Exodus. The manna did not fall on Sabbath or holidays; instead, a double portion would fall the day before the holiday or sabbath.\n\nIn some customs, each loaf is woven with six strands of dough. Together, the loaves have twelve strands, alluding to the twelve loaves of the showbread offering in the Temple. Other numbers of strands commonly used are three, five and seven. Occasionally twelve are used, referred to as a \"Twelve Tribes\" challah.\n\nIt is customary to begin the evening and day Sabbath and holiday meals with the following sequence of rituals:\n\n\nThe specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread. Others say the blessing, cut or tear the challah into pieces, and only then dip the pieces in salt, or sprinkle them with salt, before they are eaten.\n\nNormally, the custom is not to talk between washing hands and eating bread. However, according to some, if salt was not placed on the table, it is permitted to ask for someone to bring salt, before the blessing on bread is recited.\n\nSalting challah is considered a critical component of the meal. The customs of dipping in salt, sprinkling salt or merely having it on the table are based on a specific Biblical command.\n\nTradition suggests that a meal without salt cannot be considered a meal. As Soferim 15:8 suggests, as the world could not do without salt, neither could it do without Torah. The challah bread, blessed and eaten on the Sabbath, is a part of this obligation; especially considering the challah was the priest’s portion of the bread during the Temple period.\n\nIn the Torah, salt symbolizes the eternal covenant with God. As a preservative, the mineral never spoils or decays, signifying the immortality of this bond. Moreover, adding taste to food, salt represents a covenant with God that has meaning and flavor.\n\nThe Torah requires that Temple sacrifices to God, sometimes described as the \"food of God,\" be offered with salt. Leviticus 2:13 states \"with all thy sacrifices, thou shalt offer salt.\" While this verse seems to relate to meal-offerings only; rabbis later concluded that just as no sacrifices can be offered without the presence of priests, no sacrifices can be offered without salt.\n\nSalt has always played an indispensable role in Jewish life and ritual dating back to the biblical period of ancient Israel. With high quantities located in the Dead Sea region of the historical land of the Jewish people, salt was considered the most essential and common of all elements. Salt was considered the most important necessity of life.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, Jewish ritual was redefined to exist in a diaspora. Rabbinic literature suggested that a table set for a meal symbolizes the Temple altar; therefore, the blessing over food should only be recited with salt present on the table. Should one eat a meal without performing a commandment, the covenant of salt protects him.\n\nA Yiddish proverb declares that \"no Jewish table should be without salt,\" which is in accordance with the homily that makes one's table \"an altar before the Lord.\" (cf. Avot 3:4).\n\nThe midrash \"Yalkut HaReuveni\" tells the following story:\n\nThe world is one part wilderness, one part settled land, and one part sea. Said the sea to G-d: \"Master of the Universe! The Torah will be given in the wilderness; the Holy Temple will be built on settled land; and what about me?\" Said G-d: \"The people of Israel will offer your salt upon the Altar.\"\n\nRabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi interpreted this story as such: \"The wine is like the wilderness — fermentation requires wild, airborne yeast. The bread is like the settled land — bread is created through cultivation and human intervention. Salt is like the ocean — the sea, where life began and purity begins.\" These are the three realms of the world and are framework of what unifies the altar within the Jewish home. Thus through the Sabbath blessing over wine and Challah, the covenant with God is manifested.\n\nOn Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, the challah may be rolled into a circular shape (sometimes referred to as a \"turban challah\"), symbolizing the cycle of the year, and is sometimes baked with raisins in the dough. Some have the custom of continuing to eat circular challah from Rosh Hashana through the holiday of Sukkot.\n\nSometimes the top is brushed with honey to symbolize the \"sweet new year.\" According to some traditions, challah eaten on Rosh Hashana is not dipped in or sprinkled with salt but instead is dipped in or sprinkled with honey. As above, some continue to use honey instead of salt through the Sukkot holiday.\n\nFor the \"Shabbat Mevarchim\" preceding Rosh Chodesh Iyar—i.e., first \"Shabbat\" after the end of the Jewish holiday of Passover—there is a custom of baking \"shlissel challah\" (\"key challah\") as a \"segula\" (propitious sign) for \"parnassa\" (livelihood). Some make an impression of a key on top of the challah before baking, some place a key-shaped piece of dough on top of the challah before baking, and some bake an actual key inside the challah. \n\nThe earliest written source for this custom is the \"sefer\" \"Ohev Yisrael\" by Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel, the Apter Rav, written in the 1800s. He calls \"schlissel challah\" \"an ancient custom,\" and offers several kabbalistic interpretations. He writes that after spending forty years in the desert, the Israelites continued to eat the manna until they brought the Omer offering on the second day of Passover. From that day on, they no longer ate manna, but food that had grown in the Land of Israel. Since they now had to start worrying about their sustenance rather than having it handed to them each morning, the key on the challah is a form of prayer to God to open up the gates of livelihood.\n\n\"Shabbat\" challah, known as a \"bilkele\" or \"bulkele\" or \"bilkel\" or \"bulkel\" (plural: bilkelekh; ) baigiel (Polish) is a bread roll made with eggs, similar to a challah bun. It is often used as the bread for \"Shabbat\" or holiday meals.\n\nSimilar are made in other traditions: the Armenian, the Bulgarian kozunak, the Romanian cozonac, the Czech vánočka, the Slovak vianočka, the Greek tsoureki, the Polish chałka, the Finnish pulla and the Turkish choreg. Zopf is a similar bread from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\n"}

It started out as Sugar Smacks. In the 1980s, it was renamed Honey Smacks. In the early 1990s, perhaps because the product mascot, Dig'em Frog, had customarily been portrayed as calling the cereal \"Smacks\", the word \"Honey\" was dropped from the name and the product was then simply called Smacks. That name is still used in Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. However, in the US the name reverted to Honey Smacks in 2004.\n\nIn the UK in 1957, a similar product called Sugar Puffs debuted; it was formerly produced by the Quaker Oats Company, and by 1976 the mascot became a large hairy yellow creature called the Honey Monster.\n\nIn Norway and Finland, it is known as \"Honni Korn Smacks\".\n\nIn Australia, the cereal had been known as Honey Smacks since the 1970s. However, Kelloggs Australia no longer markets the brand. GoldenVale currently markets this cereal under the name Honey Wheats with a bear and a honey bee as mascot. In 2007, a minor consumer petition was launched calling for the re-instatement of the product. Honey Smacks are no longer sold in Italy.\n\nIn a 2008 comparison of the nutritional value of 27 cereals, US magazine \"Consumer Reports\" found that both Honey Smacks and Post Cereals' Golden Crisp were the two brands with the highest sugar content, more than 50 percent (by weight), commenting \"There is at least as much sugar in a serving of Kellogg's Honey Smacks [...] as there is in a glazed doughnut from Dunkin' Donuts\". (The cereals are both sweetened puffed wheat.) \"Consumer Reports\" recommended parents choose cereal brands with better nutrition ratings for their children.\n\nThe product title \"Honey Smacks\" is inconsistent with honey being a minor ingredient in the recipe. The ingredient label implies that sugar and dextrose are at least two-thirds of the sugar ingredients by weight. Conversely, the proportion of honey in the recipe could range from trace amounts to one-third.\n\nKellogg's announced a voluntary recall of certain Honey Smacks packages on June 14, 2018, due to the possible presence of salmonella. Although the recall included only packages with a specific range of expiration dates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later advised consumers to avoid eating the cereal entirely. The cereal returned to the shelves in November of that year.\n\nEver since the cereal was introduced in 1953, there have been various different mascots.\n\nCliffy the Clown\n\nVarious clowns served as the advertising mascot from 1953 to 1956, including Cliffy the Clown. Ads with these clowns were known for showing them doing the \"Sugar Smack Swing\".\n\nSmaxey the Seal\n\nIn 1957, a sailor-suit-wearing seal named Smaxey became the mascot.\n\nQuick Draw McGraw\n\nThe Hanna-Barbera cartoon horse sheriff, Quick Draw McGraw, took over in 1961.\n\nThe Smackin' Bandit\n\nIn 1965, the mascot became The Smackin' Bandit, a half-mule, half-kangaroo who kissed everyone in sight.\n\nThe Smackin' Brothers\n\nThe Smackin' Bandit was replaced in 1966 by the Smackin' Brothers, two boys dressed in boxing shorts and boxing gloves. These ads usually featured the brothers wanting Sugar Smacks but winding up smacking each other instead. Also during 1966, promotional box designs were briefly introduced featuring characters from \"Star Trek\". Later commercials were similar to most Cheerios commercials as they demonstrated how the cereal was \"vitamin-powered\". Paul Frees narrated these ads.\n\nDig'em Frog\n\nIn the early 1970s, an Indian Chief appeared briefly, replaced by Dig'em Frog in 1972. He continued as spokesfrog when the cereal was rechristened Honey Smacks in the early 1980s. In these ads, Dig'em would appear in front of a group of kids, and they would eat some cereal together.\n\nLove Smacks\n\nThis character was a heart shaped dog, which was featured in 1982 giving hugs to children.\n\nWally the Bear\n\nDig 'em was replaced by an animal more associated with honey, Wally the Bear, in 1986 (1984 in France). These ads featured Wally (not to be confused with the Wally Bear from \"Wally Bear and the NO! Gang\") pestering a kid eating a bowl of Honey Smacks and doing anything to get some, and the kid would always refuse or just ignore Wally completely.Animated by Kurtz & Friends, These commercials performed poorly since they seemed too much like the Trix commercials, and Dig'em Frog was brought back the following year by popular demand.\n\nDig'em Frog (redux)\n\nDuring the 1990s, advertising campaigns for the cereal featured Dig'em attempting to have a bowl of Smacks while trying to outsmart his nemesis, Kitty. By 1997, these commercials were discontinued. Dig'em's voice was provided by Len Dresslar and later Frank Welker. While ads for Honey Smacks no longer air in the US, more recent ads in other countries depict Dig'em as a character who is crazily addicted to Smacks.\n\nUK\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the cereal was promoted with the character Barney Bee from the mid 1980s, to compete with its rivaled Quaker's Sugar Puffs brand. By the 1990s it was changed to Dig'em Frog.\n\nIn France the cereal was called \"Smacks\" with a box featuring prominently in Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film \"Alphaville\".\n\n\n"}

Storgic lovers are friends first, and the friendship, and the storge, can endure even beyond the breakup of the sexual relationship. They want their significant others to also be their best friends, and will choose their mates based on similar goals and interests—homogamy. Storgic lovers place much importance on commitment, and find that their motivation to avoid committing infidelity is to preserve the trust between the two partners. Children and marriage are seen as legitimate long-term aims for their bond, while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles.\n\nAdvantages of storgic love may be the level of how one loves their family and understands each other.

{"id": "1085894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1085894", "title": "Golf ball", "text": "Golf ball\n\nA golf ball is a special ball designed to be used in the game of golf.\n\nUnder the rules of golf, a golf ball has a mass no more than 1.620 oz (45.93 grams), has a diameter not less than 1.680 in (42.67 mm), and performs within specified velocity, distance, and symmetry limits. Like golf clubs, golf balls are subject to testing and approval by the R&A (formerly part of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews) and the United States Golf Association, and those that do not conform with regulations may not be used in competitions \"(Rule 5–1)\".\n\nIt is commonly believed that hard wooden, round balls were the first balls used for golf between the 14th through the 17th centuries. Though they were no doubt used for other similar contemporary stick and ball games, made from hardwoods such as beech and box trees, there is no definite evidence that they were used in golf in Scotland. It is equally, if not more likely, that leather balls filled with cows' hair were used, imported from The Netherlands from at least 1486 onward. Then or later, the \"featherie\" ball was developed and introduced. A featherie, or feathery, is a hand-sewn round leather pouch stuffed with chicken or goose feathers and coated with paint, usually white in color. The volume measurement for the feathers was a gentleman's top hat full of feathers. The feathers were boiled and softened before they were stuffed into the leather pouch. Making a featherie was a tedious and time-consuming process. An experienced ball maker could only make a few balls in one day, and so they were expensive. A single ball would cost between 2 shillings and 5 shillings, which is the equivalent of 10 to 20 US dollars today.\n\nThere were a few drawbacks to the featherie. First, it was hard to make a perfectly round, spherical ball, and because of this, the featherie often flew irregularly. Also, when the featherie became too wet, its distance would be reduced, and there was a possibility of its splitting open upon impact when hit or when hitting the ground or other hard surface. Despite these, the featherie was still a dramatic improvement over the wooden ball, and remained the standard golf ball well into the 19th century.\n\nIn 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams Paterson (sometimes spelled Patterson) invented the gutta-percha ball (or \"guttie\", \"gutty\"). The guttie was made from dried sap of the Malaysian sapodilla tree. The sap had a rubber-like feel and could be made round by heating and shaping it in a round mold. Because gutties were cheaper to produce, could be re-formed if they became out-of-round or damaged, and had improved aerodynamic qualities, they soon became the preferred ball for use. Accidentally, it was discovered that nicks in the guttie from normal use actually provided a ball with a more consistent ball flight than a guttie with a perfectly smooth surface. Thus, makers began intentionally making indentations into the surface of new balls using either a knife or hammer and chisel, giving the guttie a textured surface. Many patterns were tried and used. These new gutties, with protruding nubs left by carving patterned paths across the ball's surface, became known as \"brambles\" due to their resemblance to bramble fruit.\n\nThe next major breakthrough in golf ball development came in 1898. Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio for a golf date with Bertram Work, the superintendent of the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some rubber thread and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, and that was the birth of the 20th century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball. For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a layer of rubber thread into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balata sap. The balata is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balata, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balata-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or \"smile\" will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play in most instances.\n\nIn the early 1900s, it was found that dimpling the ball provided even more control of the ball's trajectory, flight, and spin. David Stanley Froy, James McHardy, and Peter G. Fernie received a patent in 1897 for a ball with indentations; Froy played in the Open in 1900 at the Old Course at St. Andrews with the first prototype. Players were able to put additional backspin on the new wound, dimpled balls when using more lofted clubs, thus inducing the ball to stop more quickly on the green. Manufacturers soon began selling various types of golf balls with various dimple patterns to improve the length, trajectory, spin, and overall \"feel\" characteristics of the new wound golf balls. Wound, balata-covered golf balls were used into the late twentieth century.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, a new synthetic resin, an ionomer of ethylene acid named Surlyn, was introduced (by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), as were new urethane blends for golf ball covers, and these new materials soon displaced balata as they proved more durable and more resistant to cutting. Along with various other materials that came into use to replace the rubber-wound internal sphere, golf balls came to be classified as either two-piece, three-piece, or four-piece balls according to the number of layered components. These basic materials continue to be used in modern balls, with further advances in technology creating balls that can be customized to a player's strengths and weaknesses, and even allowing for the combination of characteristics that were formerly mutually-exclusive.\n\nLiquid cores were commonly used in golf balls as early as 1917. The liquid cores in many of the early balls contained a caustic liquid, typically an alkali, causing eye injuries to children who happened to dissect a golf ball out of curiosity. By the 1920s, golf ball manufacturers had stopped using caustic liquids, but into the 1970s and 1980s golf balls were still at times exploding when dissected and were causing injuries due to the presence of crushed crystalline material present in the liquid cores.\n\nIn 1967, Spalding purchased a patent for a solid golf ball from Jim Bartsch. The original patent proposed a ball void of the former layered approach seen in earlier designs, but Bartsch's patent lacked the chemical properties needed in its manufacturing. Under Spalding, and its chemical engineering team, the development of a chemical resin eliminated the need for the former layered components entirely. Since this time, the majority of non-professional golfers have transitioned to using solid core (or \"2-piece\") golf balls.\n\nThe specifications for the golf ball continue to be governed by the ruling bodies of the game; namely, The Royal & Ancient (The R&A), formerly part of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and the United States Golf Association (USGA).\n\nThe Rules of Golf, jointly governed by the R&A and the USGA, state in Appendix III that the diameter of a \"conforming\" golf ball cannot be any smaller than , and the weight of the ball may not exceed . The ball must also have the basic properties of a spherically symmetrical ball, generally meaning that the ball itself must be spherical and must have a symmetrical arrangement of dimples on its surface. Additional rules direct players and manufacturers to other technical documents published by the R&A and USGA with additional restrictions, such as radius and depth of dimples, maximum launch speed from test apparatus (generally defining the coefficient of restitution) and maximum total distance when launched from the test equipment.\n\nIn general, the governing bodies and their regulations seek to provide a relatively level playing field and maintain the traditional form of the game and its equipment, while not completely halting the use of new technology in equipment design.\n\nUntil 1990, it was permissible to use balls of less than 1.68 inches in diameter in tournaments under the jurisdiction of the R&A, which differed in its ball specifications rules from those of the USGA. This ball was commonly called a \"British\" ball, while the golf ball approved by the USGA was simply the \"American ball\". The smaller diameter gave the player a distance advantage, especially in high winds, as the smaller ball created a similarly smaller \"wake\" behind it.\n\nWhen a golf ball is hit, the impact, which lasts less than a millisecond, determines the ball’s velocity, launch angle and spin rate, all of which influence its trajectory and its behavior when it hits the ground.\n\nA ball moving through air experiences two major aerodynamic forces, lift and drag. Dimpled balls fly farther than non-dimpled balls due to the combination of these two effects.\nFirst, the dimples on the surface of a golf ball cause the boundary layer on the upstream side of the ball to transition from laminar to turbulent. The turbulent boundary layer is able to remain attached to the surface of the ball much longer than a laminar boundary and so creates a narrower low-pressure wake and hence less pressure drag. The reduction in pressure drag causes the ball to travel farther.\n\nSecond, backspin generates lift by deforming the airflow around the ball, in a similar manner to an airplane wing. This is called the Magnus effect.\n\nBackspin is imparted in almost every shot due to the golf club's loft (i.e., angle between the clubface and a vertical plane). A backspinning ball experiences an upward lift force which makes it fly higher and longer than a ball without spin.\n\nSidespin occurs when the clubface is not aligned perpendicularly to the intended direction of swing or ball-to-target line, leading to a lift force that makes the ball curve to one side or the other based on the direction of where the clubface is pointing at impact. The dimples allow both the sidespin to occur as well as to promote an angular upward lift. Some dimple designs are claimed to reduce the sidespin effects to provide a straighter ball flight.\n\nTo keep the aerodynamics optimal, the golf ball needs to be clean, including all dimples. Thus, it is advisable that golfers wash their balls whenever permissible by the rules of golf. Golfers can wash their balls manually using a wet towel or using a ball washer of some type.\n\nDimples first became a feature of golf balls when English engineer and manufacturer William Taylor, co-founder of the Taylor-Hobson company, registered a patent for a dimple design in 1905. William Taylor had realized that golf players were trying to make irregularities on their balls, noticing that used balls were going further than new ones. Hence he decided to make systematic tests to determine what surface formation would give the best flight. He then developed a pattern consisting of regularly spaced indentations over the entire surface, and later tools to help producing such balls in series\nOther types of patterned covers were in use at about the same time, including one called a \"mesh\" and another named the \"bramble\", but the dimple became the dominant design due to \"the superiority of the dimpled cover in flight\".\n\nMost golf balls on sale today have about 250–450 dimples, though there have been balls with more than 1000 dimples. The record holder was a ball with 1,070 dimples—414 larger ones (in four different sizes) and 656 pinhead-sized ones.\n\nOfficially sanctioned balls are designed to be as symmetrical as possible. This symmetry is the result of a dispute that stemmed from the Polara, a ball sold in the late 1970s that had six rows of normal dimples on its equator but very shallow dimples elsewhere. This asymmetrical design helped the ball self-adjust its spin axis during the flight. The USGA refused to sanction it for tournament play and, in 1981, changed the rules to ban aerodynamic asymmetrical balls. Polara's producer sued the USGA and the association paid US$1.375 million in a 1985 out-of-court settlement. Polara Golf now manufactures balls with “Self-Correcting Technology” for non-tournament play.\n\nGolf balls are usually white, but are available in other high visibility colors, which helps with finding the ball when lost or when playing in low-light or frosty conditions.\n\nAs well as bearing the maker's name or logo, balls are usually printed with numbers or other symbols to help players identify their ball.\n\nToday, golf balls are manufactured using a variety of different materials, offering a range of playing characteristics to suit the player's abilities and desired flight and landing behaviors.\n\nA key consideration is \"compression\", typically determined by the hardness of the ball's core layers. A harder \"high-compression\" ball will fly further because of the more efficient transfer of energy into the ball, but will also transmit more of a shock through the club to the player's hands (a \"hard feel\"). A softer \"low-compression\" ball will do just the opposite. Golfers typically prefer a softer feel, especially in the \"short game\", as the softer ball typically also has greater backspin with lofted irons. But drive distance is also of critical importance to many players wanting to get on the green in fewer strokes for a chance at a birdie or eagle, which a softer ball will reduce by wasting some of the impact energy in its compression.\n\nAnother consideration is \"spin\", affected by compression and by the cover material; a \"high-spin\" ball allows more of the ball's surface to contact the clubface at impact, allowing the grooves of the clubface to \"grip\" the ball and induce more backspin at launch. Backspin creates lift that can increase carry distance, and also provides \"bite\" which allows a ball to arrest its forward motion at the initial point of impact, bouncing straight up or even backwards, allowing for precision placement of the ball on the green with an approach shot. However, high-spin cover materials, typically being softer, are less durable which shortens the useful life of the ball, and backspin is not desirable on most long-distance shots, such as with the driver, as it causes the shot to \"balloon\" and then to bite on the fairway, when additional rolling distance is usually desired.\n\nLastly, the pattern of dimples plays a role. By regulation, the arrangement of the dimples on the ball must be as symmetrical as possible; however, the dimples don't all have to be the same size, nor be in a uniform distribution. This allows designers to arrange the dimple patterns in such a way that the resistance to spinning is lower along certain axes of rotation and higher along others; this causes the ball to \"settle\" into one of these low-resistance axes that (golfers hope) is close to parallel with the ground and perpendicular to the direction of travel, thereby eliminating \"sidespin\" induced by a slight mishit, which will cause the ball to curve off its intended flight path. A badly mishit ball will still curve, as the ball will settle into a spin axis that is not parallel with the ground which, much like an aircraft's wings, will cause the shot to bank either to the left or to the right.\n\nThere are many types of golf balls on the market, and customers often face a difficult decision. Golf balls are divided into two categories: recreational and advanced balls. Recreational balls are oriented toward the ordinary golfer, who generally have low swing speeds ( or lower) and lose golf balls on the course easily. These balls are made of two layers, with the cover firmer than the core. Their low compression and side spin reduction characteristics suit the lower swing speeds of average golfers quite well. Furthermore, they generally have lower prices than the advanced balls, lessening the financial impact of losing a ball to a hazard or out of bounds.\n\nAdvanced balls are made of multiple layers (three or more), with a soft cover and firm core. They induce a greater amount of spin from lofted shots (wedges especially), as well as a sensation of softness in the hands in short-range shots. However, these balls require a much greater swing speed that only the physically strong players could carry out to compress at impact. If the compression of a golf ball does not match a golfer's swing speed, either the lack of compression or over-compression will occur, resulting in loss of distance. There are also many brands and colors to choose from, with colored balls and better brands generally being more expensive, making an individual's choice more difficult.\n\nA practice ball or range ball is similar to a recreational golf ball, but is designed to be inexpensive, durable and have a shorter flight distance, while still retaining the principal behaviors of a \"real\" golf ball and so providing useful feedback to players. All of these are desirable qualities for use in an environment like a driving range, which may be limited in maximum distance, and must have many thousands of balls on-hand at any time that are each hit and mis-hit hundreds of times during their useful life.\n\nTo accomplish these ends, practice balls are typically harder-cored than even recreational balls, have a firmer, more durable cover to withstand the normal abrasion caused by a club's hitting surface, and are made as cheaply as possible while maintaining a durable, quality product. Practice balls are typically labelled with \"PRACTICE\" in bold lettering, and often also have one or more bars or lines printed on them, which allow players (and high-speed imaging aids) to see the ball's spin more easily as it leaves the tee or hitting turf.\n\nPractice balls conform to all applicable requirements of the Rules of Golf, and as such are legal for use on the course, but as the hitting characteristics are not ideal, players usually opt for a better-quality ball for actual play.\n\nPlayers, especially novice and casual players, lose a large number of balls during the play of a round. Balls hit into water hazards, penalty areas, buried deeply in sand, and otherwise lost or abandoned during play are a constant source of litter that groundskeepers must contend with, and can confuse players during a round who may hit an abandoned ball (incurring a penalty by strict rules). An estimated 1.2 billion balls are manufactured every year and an estimated 300 million are lost in the US alone.\n\nA variety of devices such as nets, harrows, sand rakes etc. have been developed that aid the groundskeeping staff in efficiently collecting these balls from the course as they accumulate. Once collected, they may be discarded, kept by the groundskeeping staff for their own use, repurposed on the club's driving range, or sold in bulk to a recycling firm. These firms clean and resurface the balls to remove abrasions and stains, grade them according to their resulting quality, and sell the various grades of playable balls back to golfers through retailers at a discount.\n\nUsed or recycled balls with obvious surface deformation, abrasion or other degradation are known informally as \"shags\", and while they remain useful for various forms of practice drills such as chipping, putting and driving, and can be used for casual play, players usually opt for used balls of higher quality, or for new balls, when playing in serious competition. Other grades are typically assigned letters or proprietary terms, and are typically differentiated by the cost and quality of the ball when new and the ability of the firm to restore the ball to \"like-new\" condition. The \"top grade\" balls are typically balls that are considered the current state of the art and, after cleaning and surfacing, are indistinguishable externally from a new ball sold by the manufacturer.\n\nIn addition to recycled balls, casual golfers wishing to procure quality balls at a discount price can often purchase \"X-outs\". These are \"factory seconds\"; balls which have failed the manufacturer's quality control testing standards and which the manufacturer therefore does not wish to sell under its brand name. To avoid a loss of money on materials and labor, however, the balls which still generally conform to the Rules are marked to obscure the brand name (usually with a series of \"X\"s, hence the most common term \"X-out\"), packaged in generic boxes and sold at a deep discount.\n\nTypically, the flaw that caused the ball to fail QC does not have a significant effect on its flight characteristics (balls with serious flaws are usually discarded outright at the manufacturing plant), and so these \"X-outs\" will often perform identically to their counterparts that have passed the company's QC. They are thus a good choice for casual play. However, because the balls have been effectively \"disowned\" for practical and legal purposes by their manufacturer, they are not considered to be the same as the brand-name balls on the USGA's published Conforming Golf Ball List. Therefore, when playing in a tournament or other event that requires the ball used by the player to appear on this list as a \"condition of competition\", X-outs of any kind are illegal.\n\nGolfers need to distinguish their ball from other players' to ensure that they do not play the wrong ball. This is often done by making a mark on the ball using a permanent marker pen such as a Sharpie. A wide number of markings are used; a majority of players either simply write their initial in a particular color, or color in a particular arrangement of the dimples on the ball. Many players make multiple markings so that at least one can be seen without having to lift the ball. Marking tools such as stamps and stencils are available to speed the marking process.\n\nAlternatively, balls are usually sold pre-marked with the brand and model of golf ball, and also with a letter, number or symbol. This combination can usually (but not always) be used to distinguish a player's ball from other balls in play and from lost or abandoned balls on the course. Companies, country clubs and event organizers commonly have balls printed with their logo as a promotional tool, and some professional players are supplied with balls by their sponsors which have been custom-printed with something unique to that player (their name, signature, or a personal symbol).\n\nGolf balls with embedded radio transmitters to allow lost balls to be located were first introduced in 1973, only to be rapidly banned for use in competition. More recently RFID transponders have been used for this purpose, though these are also illegal in tournaments. This technology can however be found in some computerized driving ranges. In this format, each ball used at the range has an RFID with its own unique transponder code. When dispensed, the range registers each dispensed ball to the player, who then hits them towards targets in the range. When the player hits a ball into a target, they receive distance and accuracy information calculated by the computer. The use of this technology was first commercialized by World Golf Systems Group to create TopGolf, a brand and chain of computerized ranges now owned by International Management Company.\n\nCanadian long drive champion Jason Zuback broke the world ball speed record on an episode of Sport Science with a golf ball speed of . The previous record of was held by José Ramón Areitio, a Jai Alai player.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1085938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1085938", "title": "Romance copula", "text": "Romance copula\n\nThe copula in some of the Romance languages, the equivalent of the verb \"to be\" in English, is relatively complex compared to many other languages. A copula is a word that links the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement). Whereas English has one main copula verb (and some languages like Russian mostly express the copula implicitly) some Romance languages have more complex forms.\n\nSpanish, Portuguese, Italian and some other Romance languages have more than one copula verb. This is because the verb or verbs meaning \"to be\" in the Romance languages are derived from three Latin verbs: \n\nAs the Romance languages developed over time, the three separate Latin verbs became just one or two verbs in the Romance languages.\n\nThe reduction of three separate verbs into just one or two appears to have occurred as follows:\n\nThe development of two copular verbs in this manner occurred most completely in Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan. In other languages, most usages of English \"to be\" are still translated by :\n\nPortuguese also developed an additional copular verb \"ficar\", with the meaning \"to be located\" and \"to become\".\n\nIn English, it is possible to say \"there stands...\" instead of \"there is...\" in certain contexts. In Latin, too, it became common to eschew in favour of and say where things \"stood\" instead of where they \"were\". With time, it became common to use this verb to express other states.\n\nToday, Spanish, Galician, Portuguese, Catalan, and (to a lesser extent) Italian commonly use two copulas, one from each of the Latin verbs. The others use just one main copula, from .\n\nThere is also a notable tendency for a derivative of the supine of () to replace the past participle of verbs deriving from (which in Latin had no supine). Examples:\n\n\nThe Spanish copulas are \"ser\" and \"estar\". The latter developed as follows:\n\nThe copula \"ser\" developed from two Latin verbs. Thus its inflectional paradigm is a combination: most of it derives from (to be) but the present subjunctive appears to come from (to sit) via the Old Spanish verb \"seer\".\n\nE.g. derivation from :\n\nDerivation from :\n\nThe infinitive (on which the modern future and conditional are based) could have derived from either or both:\n\nIn the early part of the second millennium, in texts such as the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\", \"ser\" was still used mostly as in Latin, and there was little place for \"estar\"; sentences like \"Es pagado, e davos su amor\", \"He is satisfied, and he gives you his favour\" are found, where modern Spanish might have \"Queda contento,\" or \"Está satisfecho, y le da su favor\".\n\nAs the centuries went by, \"estar\" spread in use. Today, \"ser\" is used to express the fundamental nature, identity or characteristics of something – what it \"really is\", whilst \"estar\" expresses the state something \"happens to be in\". Indeed, \"ser\" is etymologically related to the English words \"essence\" and \"is\", and \"estar\" with \"state\", \"status\", \"standing\", \"stance\" and \"stay\".\n\nThe verb \"quedar\" (which also has the specific meanings of \"to remain\", \"to be as a result\" and others) is often used in a similar way to \"estar\". It derives from the Latin ( in the infinitive), \"to rest\".\n\n\n\nWith adjectives referring to beauty and the like, \"ser\" means \"to be\", and \"estar\" means \"to look\".\n\nNote that the differentiation between \"nature\" and \"state\" makes sense when talking about the states of life and death: \"Él está vivo\" (He is alive), \"Él está muerto\" (He is dead). \"Estar\" is used for both alive and dead, since they are both states, although being dead is considered a permanent state.\n\n\"Ser\" is used when stating the stage of life at which a person is. The old, the young, etc. are seen as groups that one can belong to. It is a question of identity:\nHowever, age can also be presented not as a matter of identity but a state:\n\nThe use of \"estar\" gives a certain special nuance to some verbs. For example, \"estar guapa\", though it has the sense of \"to be beautiful\", also emphasizes the use of make-up and clothes to create a beautiful look. \"Ser sucio\" instead of the more usual \"estar sucio\" means to be the sort of person who is likely to be dirty.\n\nThe adjective \"loco\" (\"mad\", \"crazy\", \"insane\") is always used with \"estar\" in Spain, as the implication is that the person \"has gone mad\" (i.e. a change of state). It is possible to give it a permanent nuance, but only by using it as a noun: \"Él es un loco\", \"He is a madman\". \"Ser loco\" is used in certain regions in Latin America, however, meaning a permanent insanity as opposed to \"estar loco\" meaning have gone mad or acting crazy.\n\nThe expression \"como una cabra\" (with the implied \"loco\" omitted) is used with \"estar\" to mean \"mad as a hatter\", \"crazy as a loon\". \"Ser como una cabra\" would literally mean, \"to be like a goat\".\n\n\"Ser\" is used with adjectives of fundamental belief, nationality, sex, intelligence, etc. The use of \"estar\" with \"francés\" (\"French\") would sound quite odd to native Spanish speakers, as though it meant, \"to feel a bit French\". Similarly, \"no estar católico\" does not mean, \"to no longer be Catholic\", but is a colloquial expression meaning \"to feel under the weather\". Note that this is a state.\n\nIt is often stated that the difference between the two verbs corresponds to \"permanent\" versus \"temporary\", but it is more accurate to describe the distinction as one of \"essential nature\" versus \"state or condition\". The \"essential nature\" of things does sometimes change, and this is reflected in the language. For example, someone who had been depressed for a prolonged period, and then had a life changing experience like a new career or long-term relationship, might say \"ahora yo soy feliz\", meaning, \"now I am happy\".\n\nA special use of \"ser\", which expresses neither a nature nor a state but an action, is the formation of the passive voice:\nNote that the Spanish passive voice is rarer than in English, with other turns of phrase being used instead.\n\n\"Estar\" is usually used with adjectives that derive from past participles of verbs since the use of \"ser\" would sound like a verb in the passive voice. Such adjectives in any case generally refer to states:\n\nA special example of this tendency is what happens with words indicating prohibition and suchlike. If an adjective not deriving from a verb were used, then the meaning would definitely require \"ser\". To say the same thing with a past participle, \"estar\" (or \"quedar\") is required, in order to differentiate it from the use of \"ser\" with a past participle implying an action expressed in the passive voice:\n\nThis fine nuance is not encountered in other Romance languages, which do not go to such lengths to distinguish between passives and similar-sounding phrases.\n\n\"Estar\" is used to refer to physical location. In Spanish, location is regarded as a state, and therefore is indicated with \"estar\", even in those cases (e.g. \"Madrid está en España\" \"Madrid is in Spain\") when one might think that it is something so permanent and fundamental that it could be logical to use \"ser\". The use of \"estar\" for location may be easier for English speakers to grasp if they recall that it is derived from Latin , \"to stand.\" \n\nWith immobile things, \"quedar\" is sometimes used instead of \"estar\", especially when there is a reference to a length of time, or a remaining distance, e.g.:\n\nHowever, \"ser\" can sometimes occur with words such as \"aquí\", which can mislead learners into thinking that physical location can be expressed with \"ser\". In fact, the verb in this case identifies the place rather than expressing where it is. For example, one might say to a taxi driver the following phrases, to indicate that you have arrived:\n\nThe difference becomes clear if \"aquí\" is changed to \"esta calle\":\n\n\"Es aquí\" and \"es esta calle\" express the idea that \"this is the place\", a concept quite different from what is expressed by \"estar\".\n\nThe only case in which true location is expressed by \"ser\" is when an event rather than a physical thing is referred to:\n\n\"Ser\" is always used when the complement is a noun or pronoun, regardless of whether the speaker intended to express a fundamental essence (though in practice speakers do tend to express this):\n\nHowever, it is not always easy to know what is a noun. For example, \"pez\" is a noun meaning \"fish\", but \"estar pez\" is a colloquial expression meaning to be \"rubbish\" or \"useless\" at a given activity.\n\n\"Estar\" must be used when the complement is \"bien\" or \"mal\", no matter what meaning is intended.\n\nMany adjectives change in meaning entirely depending on the verb used, sometimes meaning almost the opposite. Note that in each case the meaning which is more of a \"nature\" goes with \"ser\" and the meaning which is more of a \"state\" goes with \"estar\".\nAlthough \"sadness\" is expressed straightforwardly with \"estar triste\", \"happiness\" is a little trickier. The quality of being joyous, lively and happy is expressed with \"ser alegre\". This can describe people, music, colours, etc. \"Estar alegre\" expresses the state of being merry, which in practice may sometimes mean \"drunk\", \"tipsy\".\n\nA person who is fundamentally happy in life is said to \"ser feliz\"; indeed \"la felicidad\" is that \"happiness\" for which humans strive. This happiness often turns out to be a transitory state, a person may nevertheless declare \"yo soy feliz\" as a statement of optimism that goes beyond the description of today's mood that is expressed by any phrase with \"estar\". As for such moods, they can be expressed with \"estar feliz\".\n\nWhen not a state but a change of state is referred to, the expression is \"quedar contento\" or \"alegrarse\": \"Ella quedó muy contenta cuando yo le dije que ella había ganado\" = \"she was very glad when I told her that she had won\"; \"Yo me alegro de que vosotros hayáis llegado\" = \"I am glad that you (plural) have come\".\n\nIn the excerpt from the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\" above, one can see that \"to be happy\" a thousand years ago was \"ser pagado\" (meaning \"to be paid\" in current Spanish).\n\nThe Portuguese copulas are \"ser\" and \"estar\". As in Spanish, \"estar\" derived from Latin / :\nThe copula \"ser\" developed both from and . Thus its inflectional paradigm is a combination of these two Latin verbs: most tenses derive from and a few from . E.g. derivation from :\nE.g. derivation from :\n\n\nThe distinction between the two verbs is very similar to that of Catalan. Compared to Spanish, \"estar\" is a little less used. The main difference between Spanish and Portuguese lies in the interpretation of the concept of state versus essence and in the generalisations in some constructions. There is perhaps a little more of a concept of permanent versus temporary, rather than essence versus state. For example, unlike Spanish, Portuguese does not require \"estar\" with past participles; in this case, it follows the general rule regarding state/essence.\nThe word \"feita\", \"made\", is usually omitted.\nThe same applies to sentences expressing interdictions:\n\nHowever, there are some nuances in these verbs in the passive voice. In this case, the use of \"ser\" or \"estar\" depends on the tense of the verb. E.g.: to say that somebody is not allowed to smoke, only \"estar\" can be used in the present tense:\nIn past tenses, both \"ser\" and \"estar\" can be used, conveying a different meaning:\n\nPortuguese counts location as permanent and fundamental, and accordingly uses \"ser\", or the more specific secondary copula \"ficar\" (to stay), from Latin , \"to place/set\":\nbut:\n\nWith adjectives referring to beauty and the like, \"ser\" means \"to be\", and \"estar\" means \"to look\".\n\nAs in Spanish, the differentiation between \"nature\" and \"state\" makes sense when talking about the states of life and death: \"Está vivo\" (He is alive); \"Está morto\" (He is dead).\nNotice the important difference between \"ser morto\" (to be killed) and \"estar morto\" (to be dead):\n\n\"Louco\" (mad) can be used with \"ser\" or \"estar\", giving different connotations:\n\n\"Ser\" is used with adjectives expressing:\n\n\"Estar católico\" is used with the same sense as in Spanish:\n\nApart from this exception, due to its different meanings, \"estar\" cannot be used for nationality, gender, or intelligence, but one can say \"Estou abrasileirado\" (I have acquired Brazilian ways – state) or \"Estás americanizado\" (You have been Americanised – state).\nThe same applies for the difference between \"É um homem\" \"He is a man\" and \"Está um homem\", meaning, \"He has grown up to be a man\".\n\n\"Ficar\", apart from its use as \"to stay\", and the use mentioned above as a copula translated as \"to be located\", is extensively used for a change of state (sometimes quite sudden), being translated as \"to get\" or \"to become\":\n\nThe Catalan copulas developed as follows:\n\nThe last three forms of the first verb survive in modern Catalan. \"Ésser\" is considered the most standard, followed by \"ser\" and, distantly, \"esser\". The verb \"seure\" remains as a distinct verb and is not considered a copula.\n\nIn Catalan, \"ésser\" and \"estar\" work in a way intermediate between those of Italian and Portuguese. A complete description of its rules of usage is as follows:\n\n\nThis can be summed up in five simple rules:\n\n\n\"Animate objects\" refers mainly to people, animals, and whatever is thought to be sentient (for example, a child playing with a doll will probably treat it as an animate object).\n\nThe Italian copulas did not undergo the same development as in other languages, having preserved the Vulgar Latin forms \"essere\" and \"stare\".\n\n\"Essere\" is the main copula. \"Stare\" refers to state rather than essence, but more narrowly than in Spanish. \"Essere\" is used for almost all cases in which English uses \"to be\". It therefore makes sense to concentrate on the few uses of \"stare\".\n\nLike the Spanish \"quedar\", Italian uses \"rimanere\", from Latin (both meaning \"to remain\"), in the sense of \"to be as a result\"; e.g. \"È rimasta incinta\" = \"she became pregnant (as a result)\".\n\nThe Sicilian copulas developed as follows:\n\n\nIn Sicilian, the meanings and usages of these two copulas are not as broad as in the other languages. \"Siri\" is the dominant copula, even more so than in the other Romance languages and is used for almost all cases in which English uses “to be”. \"Stari\" has been relegated to only a few common uses:\n\n\n\"Siri\" is no longer in use as an auxiliary verb. \"Aviri\" has completely replaced it in all verbs.\n\nOccitan has just one copula, estre; which is also written èsser, ester, estar in diverse dialects.\n\nModern French has only one copula. Old French, however, had \"estre\" ( → \"essere\" → *\"essre\" → \"estre\") and \"ester\" ( → *\"estare\" → \"estar\" → \"ester\"). The latter meant to ‘stand’, ‘stay’ or ‘stop’, and might have been used as a copula in a similar way to other Romance languages. With phonetic evolution, the forms of each verb tended to be confused with one another, with the result that \"estre\" finally absorbed \"ester\"; around the same time, most words beginning with \"est-\" changed to \"ét-\" or \"êt-\". The modern form of the verb is \"être\".\n\nThe only clear traces of \"ester\" (or \"éter\" if we bear in mind the loss of the \"s\") in the modern copula are the past participle and the imperfect. Instead of the *\"étu\" one would expect, we find \"été\" – just what we would expect from \"ester\"/\"éter\". The same tendency to use past participles derived from (the supine of ) to replace the past participles of the main copula is also seen in Italian and Catalan. The Old French imperfect was \"iere\" (from Latin ); this was replaced in Middle French by the imperfect of \"ester\", which was \"estois\" (from Vulgar Latin *\"estaba\", Latin ).\n\nThe present participle and all imperfect forms of \"être\" are regular and correspond to what one would expect for a verb with the stem \"êt-\"; however, they could also be considered as deriving from \"éter\" since the forms coincide.\n\nAll other forms of \"être\" are from rather than .\n\n\"Ester\" also survives in the infinitive in the set phrases \"ester en justice\" and \"\", which translate the Latin term \"STARE IN IVDICIO\" meaning \"to appear in court\", \"to stand before the court\". \"Ester en justice\" has come to mean, \"to file a lawsuit\", i.e. to appear in court as the active party. This is a highly defective verb and only exists in the infinitive.\n\n\nRomansh has just one copula, \"esser\". \"Star\" means, \"to reside\".\n\n\"A fi, fire\" is the copula in Romanian. These infinitive forms evolved from the passive verb , \"to become\", \"to be made\":\n\nIn Latin was used suppletively as the passive voice of \"to do\", \"to make\". However in the Vulgar Latin dialects spoken in modern-day Romania, its evolved form \"fiere\" replaced \"essere\", maybe due to the similarity between the stems \"fi-\" of and \"fu-\" of (which is not coincidental, as both stems descend from the Proto-Indo-European verb \"*bʰuH-\").\n\nOther forms of the verb \"a fi\" are derived from : \"sunt, ești, e(ste), suntem, sunteți, sunt\" in the present tense and \"eram, erai, era, eram, erați, erau\" in the imperfect.\n\n\"A sta\" (stare) ( → \"sta\") means \"to stay\" or even \"to stand\", \"to stand still\" or \"to dwell/reside\" e.g. \"a sta in picioare\", as in Italian \"stare in piedi\" or \"unde stai?\" – \"where do you live/reside?\"\n\nFor information on the morphological evolution of the Romance copula, see Romance verbs.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was introduced in the US in 1947.\n\nAt the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to Cracker Jack's candy-coated popcorn. The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as \"Ranger Joe\", the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated breakfast cereal. Post Foods introduced their own version in 1948.\nThe Post version was originally called Happy Jax, and was renamed to Sugar Crisp the next year. In 1967, The name was later changed to Super Sugar Crisp, and in 1985, it was changed again to Super Golden Crisp. Finally, it was changed to Golden Crisp (during a time when many cereals dropped the word \"Sugar\" from their names) in the American market.\n\nIn the early 1970s, there was a short-lived variation on the original Sugar Crisp, called Super Orange Crisp, which had orange-flavored O's in it.\n\nThe product is still sold as Sugar Crisp in Canada. In Canada, the box still displays the Sugar Bear mascot and the phrase \"Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp.\"\n\nAdvertisements in the 1950s positioned this sugar cereal as being appropriate to eat for breakfast, as a snack, or as candy, similar to candy-coated popcorn products like Cracker Jack. Early advertisements featured three animated cartoon bears named Candy, Handy, and Dandy as the mascots. The early slogan said, \"As a cereal it's dandy—for snacks it's so handy—or eat it like candy!\"\n\nLater television advertisements feature one mascot, an anthropomorphic cartoon bear character known as Sugar Bear, who sings the jingle, \"Can't get enough of that Golden Crisp.\", to the tune of Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho. In commercials, Sugar Bear could turn into \"Super Bear\" upon eating it. This was dropped in the mid-late 1980s, where he would simply defeat his foes with a \"vitamin-packed punch\" as Sugar Bear. The jingle was also expanded to conclude with \"it's got the crunch with punch\", although this was dropped in later years. Sugar Bear's voice, provided by Gerry Matthews for forty years, was reminiscent of Bing Crosby or Dean Martin.\n\nThe focus of advertising shifted from targeting children to including parents, by downplaying the sweet taste (and associated sugar content).\n\nIn 1975, Super Orange Crisp was found to contain almost 71 percent sugar by dentist Ira Shannon, who became tired of seeing so many cavities in his patients' mouths and bought hundreds of boxes of sugary breakfast cereal and analyzed the contents of each in a lab.\n\nIn a 2008 comparison of the nutritional value of 27 cereals, U.S. magazine \"Consumer Reports\" found that Post's Golden Crisp and Kellogg's Honey Smacks were the two brands with the highest sugar content—more than 50 percent (by weight)—commenting that one serving of this or other high-sugar cereals contained at least as much sugar \"as there is in a glazed doughnut from Dunkin' Donuts\". The two cereals are both sweetened puffed wheat. Consumer Reports recommended parents to choose cereal brands with better nutritional ratings for their children.\n\n\n\n"}

Variants may include garlic, spring onions, or peppers, or vinegar instead of lemon juice. While not traditionally Greek, smoked, rather than cured, cod's roe is more widely available in some places, and often used. Bottarga is usually much more expensive than cod's roe.\n\nTraditionally the dish is made with a pestle and mortar, giving a slightly grainy texture, but commercial taramasalata is commonly blended to a very smooth paste.\n\nTaramasalata is usually eaten as a \"meze\", a dip for bread or raw vegetables. The colour can vary from creamy beige to pink, depending on the type of roe and colourings used.

It has a dual function: reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker or narrator, and highlighting the sentence focus. \n\nA modal particle's effect is often vague and dependent on the overall context. Speakers often use them somewhat excessively, and sometimes combine several particles, as in \"doch mal\", \"ja nun\", or \"ja doch nun mal\". They are a feature typical of the spoken language.\n\nMost German words can be translated to English without problem, but modal particles are a challenge to translate because the English language has no real equivalent to them.\n\n\"Halt\", \"eben\", \"einmal\" (in this context, always unshortened) and \"nun einmal\" (shortened: nun mal) imply that the (often unpleasant) fact expressed in a sentence cannot be changed and must be accepted. \"Halt\" and \"nun mal\" are more colloquial than \"eben\". In English, they could be rendered to \"as a matter of fact\" or by a \"happen to\" construction.\n\n\"Ja\" (engl. \"you know\"/\"everyone knows\"/\"I already told you\") indicates that the speaker thinks a certain fact should already be known to the listener and intends the statement to be more of a reminder or conclusion.\n\n\"Einmal\", shortened \"mal\" (literally: once, translation roughly: \"for once\") also indicates a certain immediacy to the action or even implies a command. On the other hand, it can give a kind of casualness to a sentence and so making it sound less blunt. \n\n\"Doch\" can have several meanings. (See also .) For one, it can be used affirmatively, or it can convey emphasis, urgency or impatience, or it can serve as a reply to a real or imagined, or pre-emptively answered, disagreement, hesitation, or wrong assumption on the part of the listener, or other people. In other situations this can have different effects. \n\nIn this way, \"doch\" can be similar to stressed \"schon\" (\"indeed\"), but \"schon\" implies an actual qualification of the statement, often made explicit in a phrase with \"aber\" (\"but\"):\n\nThis is not to be confused with the adverbial meaning of, unstressed, schon: already. However, at least in writing schon \"already\" must either be made unmistakable by the context, e. g. by additional adverbs, or replaced by its equivalent \"bereits\".\n\nIn other contexts, \"doch\" indicates that the action described in the sentence was, in fact, unlikely to occur:\n\n\"Aber\", when not used as a conjunction, is very similar to \"doch\". It conveys a meaning of disagreement to a previously-stated or implied assertion.\n\n\"Sowieso\", \"ohnehin\" or \"eh\", meaning \"anyway(s)\", implies an emphasized assertion. Especially in the South, \"eh\" is colloquially most common. All these can be enforced by a preceding \"doch\".\n\n\"Vielleicht\", as a modal particle, is used for emphasis and should not be confused with the adverb \"vielleicht\" (meaning \"perhaps\"):\n\nBut:\n\n\"Fei\" (which is no longer recognised as the adverb \"fein\", finely) is a particle peculiar to Upper German dialects. It denotes that the speaker states something important that might be a surprise for the listener. To give an adequate translation even into Standard German is difficult; probably, the best substitute would be to use understatements with strong affirmative meaning. In English, translations to \"I should think\" or \"just to mention\" seem possible, varying from context.\n\n\"Wohl\" is often used instead of epistemic adverbs, such as \"vermutlich\" or \"wahrscheinlich\". It is also used to emphasize a strong disagreement. Literal translation with \"probably\" or at least with \"seemingly\" is possible.\n\n\n"}

In the south Indian state of Kerala, Banana Fritters are extremely popular and are known as Pazhampori (പഴംപൊരി).\n\nIn Indonesia fritters come under the category of \"gorengan\" (, from \"goreng\" \"to fry\"), and many varieties are sold on travelling carts or by street vendors throughout Indonesia. Various kinds of ingredients are battered and deep fried such as \"pisang goreng\" (banana fritter), tempeh, \"mendoan\", \"tahu goreng\" (fried tofu), oncom, sweet potato, cassava chunk, cassava tapai, \"cireng\" (tapioca fritters), bakwan (flour with chopped vegetables) and breadfruit. And these are often eaten accompanied by fresh bird's eye chili. The variety known as bakwan commonly contains flour with chopped vegetables such as carrot and cabbage, whereas the fried patties called perkedel typically consist of mashed potatoes or ground corn (\"perkedel jagung\" or \"bakwan jagung\").\n\nThe Iranian variety is called Kuku which come in different versions like the ones with potatoes or the ones with herbs.This type of fritter resembles a crustless quiche.\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, tempura is vegetable or seafood dipped and fried in a light crispy batter and served as a common accompaniment to meals.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, deep-fries are known as \"twigim\" (). \"Twigim\" are often battered and breaded, but there are varieties without breading, as well as varieties without breading and batter. Popular \"twigim\" dishes include \"dak-twigim\" (fried chicken), \"gim-mari-twigim\" (fried seaweed roll), \"goguma-twigim\" (fried sweet potato), \"gul-twigim\" (fried oyster), \"ojingeo-twigim\" (fried squid), and \"saeu-twigim\" (fried shrimp).\n\nTraditional vegetarian deep-fries associated with Korean temple cuisine include \"twigak\" and \"bugak\". \"Twigak\" are made from vegetables such as \"dasima\" (kelp) and bamboo shoot, without breading or batter. \"Bugak\" are made from vegetables such as \"dasima\", perilla leaves, and chili peppers, which are coated with glutinous rice paste and dried thoroughly.\n\nIn Malaysia, it is common for a type of fritter called \"cucur\" (such as yam, sweet potato and banana) to be fried by the roadside in a large wok and sold as snacks.\n\nIn Burmese cuisine, fritters are called \"a-kyaw\" (), while assorted fritters are called \"a-kyaw-sone\" (). The most popular a-kyaw is the gourd fritter (ဘူးသီးကြော်). Diced onions, chickpea, potatoes, a variety of leafy vegetables, brown bean paste, Burmese tofu, chayote, banana and crackling are other popular fritter ingredients. Black beans are made into a paste with curry leaves to make bayagyaw—small fritters similar to falafel. Unlike pisang goreng, Burmese banana fritters are made only with overripe bananas with no sugar or honey added.\n\nThe savory fritters are eaten mainly at breakfast or as a snack at tea. Gourd, chickpea and onion fritters are cut into small parts and eaten with Mohinga, Myanmar's national dish. These fritters are also eaten with Kao hnyin baung rice and with Burmese green sauce—called chin-saw-kar or a-chin-yay.

Hence: \"potato fritter\", \"pineapple fritter\", \"apple fritter\", \"pea fritter\", etc. At home and at school, fritters are also sometimes made with meat, especially Spam and corned beef.\n\nIn the United States, fritters are doughnuts made with a primary ingredient that is mixed with an egg and milk batter and either pan-fried or deep-fried; wheat flour, cornmeal, or a mix of the two may be used to bind the batter. \"Corn fritters\" are often made with whole canned corn and are generally deep-fried. \"Apple fritters\" are well known, although the contemporary American apple fritter is unlike the British one. Older versions of the apple fritter in the United States were prepared in the style of British ones, by slicing apples, dipping them in batter and frying them. Another regional favourite is the \"zucchini fritter\".\n\nWest African countries have many variations similar to fritters.

Some claim that it was first served during the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented. Though in 1894, a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention describing: \"A small, solid [cake] of the ice cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was first prepared.\" A third claim, beginning in the 1960s proposes that fried ice cream was invented by Japanese tempura restaurants. In the late 1960s, critic Cooper Adams refused to believe in the dish's existence until the moment it was placed in front of him.\n\nIn the United States, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the \"Dining Out\" section of the \"New York Times\" in the 1970s. It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi's adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its \"signature dessert\" when it opened in the early 1980s. The connection with Asian cuisine is also reflected in Australia.\n\nIn Australia, fried ice cream is strongly associated with Australian Chinese cuisine.\n\nThe dessert is commonly made by taking a scoop of ice cream frozen well below the temperature at which ice cream is generally kept, possibly coating it in raw egg, rolling it in cornflakes or cookie crumbs, and briefly deep frying it. The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint, though whipped cream or honey may be used as well.\n\nThe Asian recipe usually uses tempura batter. Mexican versions use corn flakes, nuts, cookie crumbs, or tortillas for coating. Common flavors in Asian restaurants are green tea, vanilla, taro and red bean.\n\nThe British film \"Comfort and Joy\" portrays the feud between two ice-cream sellers who end up joining forces in a new venture to sell \"frosty hots\" or deep-fried ice cream.

{"id": "1093071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093071", "title": "Milanesa", "text": "Milanesa\n\nThe milanesa (in Italian \"cotoletta alla milanese\") is a South American variation of an Italian dish where generic types of breaded meat fillet preparations are known as a \"milanesa\".\n\nThe milanesa was brought to the Southern Cone by Italian immigrants during the mass emigration called the Italian diaspora between 1860-1920s. Its name probably reflects an original Milanese preparation, \"cotoletta alla Milanese,\" which is similar to the Austrian \"Wiener Schnitzel\".\n\nA milanesa consists of a thin slice of beef, chicken, veal, or sometimes pork, eggplants, tempeh or soy. Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other condiments according to the cook's taste (like parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow-fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative. A similar dish is the chicken parmigiana.\n\nBy adding tomato paste, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes ham, a dish called \"milanesa a la napolitana\" (Milanese in the Neapolitan style) was created. \"Neapolitan\" is not named for the city of Naples, but because it was first made and sold in Restaurante Napoli owned by Jorge La Grotta in Argentina in the 1940s.\n\nMilanesas are one of the most popular dishes in Argentina and have been described as \"one of the quintessential Río de la Plata dishes\". They are the legacy of Italian immigrants, who introduced \"cotoletta alla milanese\" in the late 19th century and early 20th century. During that time, Argentina experienced a huge European immigration wave, with most immigrants coming from Italy. Milanesas are so ubiquitous to Argentine culture that the country even has a \"Day of the Milanesa\", celebrated on May 8. \n\nThey are frequently served hot with fried or mashed potatoes; this dish is known as \"milanesa con papas fritas\" or \"milanesa con puré\". In Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, it's often topped with a fried egg, known as \"milanesa a caballo\" (milanesa riding horseback). They are often eaten cold as a sandwich filling, with salad. Lemon juice and sometimes mayonnaise are commonly used as seasoning. Their low cost and simple preparation makes milanesas a popular meal.\n\n\"Milanesa Kaiser\", or \"escalopa\" as it is known in Chile, is a variant (where normal milanesas are also eaten) reminiscent of \"cordon bleu\" or \"valdostana\", with a layer of melted cheese between the beef and a layer of ham. A classic Chilean version is called \"escalopa a lo pobre\", topped with french fries, sautéed onions and fried eggs, akin to \"lomo a lo pobre\".\n\nIn Mexico and the Southern United States, milanesas are eaten in some regions, often in a \"torta\" (a sandwich made with \"bolillo\" or \"telera\" bread). In northern Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua (due to U.S influence), it features lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise like a traditional sandwich, but the milanesa is also common in these regions as the main course of a meal. The milanesa \"memela napolitana\" is made with a thick fried tortilla with a milanesa on top, with ham, tomato sauce and grated cheese. In Mexico, milanesa usually refers to the preparation method; any type of meat that is pounded thin, breaded and fried might be referred to as a milanesa. In the northern state of Nuevo León, perhaps due to the influence of German and Czech immigrants, the dish known as milanesa is extremely popular and stands on its own as a main dish in most restaurants. It is usually served with french fries, refried beans, rice, and a lettuce salad.\n\nIn Panama, they are most commonly made of thinly sliced beef (usually sirloin steak), but also thin chicken fillet. Lime juice is squeezed over them before serving or eating them, and often they are also seasoned with hot sauce. They are eaten with white rice and other side dishes such as salad, lentils or beans. The latter two are poured over the rice, as they are usually served in Panama while the salad is served off to the side where there is still space left on the plate. When served as sandwiches, they are known as \"emparedado de milanesa\" or \"sandwich de milanesa\" when tomatoes, onions, lettuce, ketchup, and/or American cheese (\"queso amarillo\" i.e. yellow cheese). \"Pan de molde\" (sandwich bread) and \"pan flauta\" (a Panamanian type of baguette that is thicker and softer) are the types used to make these sandwiches.\n\nIn the Philippines, milanesa is known as carne frita, and is cooked in much the same way as described above (meat pounded until thin, flour, egg, breadcrumbs, fried). Admittedly, it is not as popular in the country as it is in South America, and it is served mainly in people's homes, not in restaurants. The families that do eat it usually serve milanesa/carne frita with white rice, a bean stew of some sort (for instance, white beans with a dark leafy green; also fabada), sometimes an American-style potato salad with cut green beans added, and often, chili ketchup and/or a mayo-ketchup mixed sauce not unlike the South American salsa golf. It is virtually never served as a sandwich.\n\n\nSimilar dishes:\n"}

While typically served as a side dish, onion rings can also be eaten on their own. Like other cooked onion dishes, the cooking process decomposes propanethial oxide in the onion into the sweet-smelling and tasting bispropenyl disulfide, responsible for the slightly sweet taste of onion rings.\n\nThe exact origins of the onion ring are unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in \"The New York Times Magazine\".\n\nA recipe for French Fried Onions may have appeared in the Middletown, New York \"Daily Times\" on 13 January 1910. It does not claim to be the originator of the recipe.\n\nOne claimant to the invention of the onion ring is the Kirbys Pig Stand restaurant chain, founded in Oak Cliff, Texas, in the early 1920s. The once-thriving chain, whose heyday in the 1940s saw over 100 locations across the United States, also claims to be the originator of Texas toast.\n\nJohn Mollard's 1802 cookbook \"The Art of Cookery Made Easy and Refined\" (page 152) includes a recipe called \"Fried Onions with Parmesan Cheese.\" The recipe suggests cutting onions into 1/2\" rings, dipping them into a batter made of flour, cream, salt and pepper, and Parmesan cheese, and then deep frying them in \"boiling\" lard.

In contrast to the New York-style bagel, or the East Coast Style Bagel which also contains sourdough, the Montreal bagel is smaller, thinner, sweeter and denser, with a larger hole, and is always baked in a wood-fired oven. It contains malt, egg, and no salt, and is boiled in honey-sweetened water before being baked.\n\nIn some Montreal establishments, bagels are still produced by hand and baked in full view of the patrons. There are two predominant varieties: black-seed (poppy seed), or white-seed (sesame seed).\n\nMontreal bagels, like the similarly shaped New York bagel, were brought to North America by Jewish immigrants from Poland and other Eastern European countries; the differences in texture and taste reflect the style of the particular area in Poland in which the immigrant bakers learned their trade. Minor controversy surrounds the question of who first brought the bagel to Montreal. They were (reportedly) first baked in Montreal by Chaim (Hyman) Seligman, as verified by Montreal historian Joe King, a historian of Montreal Jewry. Seligman first worked in the neighbourhood community of Lachine and later moved his bakery to the lane next door to Schwartz's Delicatessen on Boulevard St. Laurent in central Montreal. Seligman would string his bagels into dozens and patrol Jewish Main purveying his wares, originally with a pushcart, then a horse and wagon and still later from a converted taxi. Seligman went into partnership with Myer Lewkowicz and with Jack Shlafman but fell out with both of them. Seligman and Lewkowicz founded the St. Viateur Bagel Shop in 1957 and Shlafman established Fairmount Bagel in 1919, which both still exist in the present day.\n\nA substantial proportion of Montreal's English-speaking Jewish community gradually left for other locales. Catering to this population, Montreal-style bagel shops have opened in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary, and other Canadian, and even US cities, such as Burlington, Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles & Oakland, CA and Portland, Oregon. For a time this style of bagel was almost completely unknown in the northeastern U.S. despite its proximity to Montreal, mainly due to the proximity of the rival New York City bagel. (with one exception having been in Burlington, Vermont, where Myer's Bagels boasts a Montreal-style wood-fired oven and Lloyd Squires, a former St-Viateur Bagel Shop baker). At one point in New York City there were two Montreal-style bagel locations in the borough of Brooklyn within four blocks of each other, but one is now closed and the other no longer offers Montreal-style bagels.\n\nMontreal-style bagels are currently the only style of bagel known to have ventured into space. Gregory Chamitoff, who grew up in Montreal, took three bags of sesame bagels with him on his assignments to STS-124 as passenger and ISS Expedition 17 as crewmember.\n\nMontreal-style bagels are, for the most part, manufactured by the same method used to produce a generic bagel.\nThe Montreal-style method of making bagels builds on the basic traditional method in the following ways:\n\nSeveral Montreal bagel factories are famous for their authentic Montreal-style bagels. St-Viateur Bagel, at 263 av. St-Viateur West, and Fairmount Bagel, at 74 Avenue Fairmount Ouest, are the most well-known and popular bagel shops in Montreal. St. Viateur Bagel in particular has pictures of a number of famous visitors attached to their wall. These shops often sell popular bagel accompaniments such as cream cheese spreads and smoked salmon. Some of the more popular bagel bakers have relatively recently begun to feature different flavours of bagels; Fairmount Bagel for example now offers a caraway seed bagel while St. Viateur features an 'all-dressed' variety with onion, garlic, sesame & poppy seeds.\n\n"}
{"id": "1093628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093628", "title": "Smoked meat", "text": "Smoked meat\n\nSmoked meat is a method of preparing red meat (and fish) which originates in prehistory. Its purpose is to preserve these protein-rich foods, which would otherwise spoil quickly, for long periods. There are two mechanisms for this preservation: dehydration and the antibacterial properties of phenols and other chemicals in the absorbed smoke. In modern days, the enhanced flavor of smoked foods makes them a delicacy in many cultures.\n\nSmoking of meat and fish has been practiced for ages. Indigenous cultures around the world may have used smoke during the drying of fish to drive away the flies. They soon found that the absorbed smoke acted as a preservative. Perhaps the most famous \"smokers of meat\" were the Caribbean natives who smoked it on a rack over a smoky fire, a setup they called \"barbacoa\" (one possible etymological origin of barbecue).\n\nCountry Ham is the United States version of a dry cured ham (other dry cured hams include Italy's Prosciutto, and Spain's Serrano). Most country hams are smoked at the end of the curing process (often with hickory wood). Most Country Hams are aged 90 days or longer to achieve a flavor profile.\n\nFamous among early smokers of meat are the Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Europe, and is often associated with other foods popularized by Jewish communities, such as bagels. In the United States it is referred to as pastrami, which is derived from the (pronounced \"pastrómeh\"). However, lovers of pastrami vociferously argue that the consistency, flavoring, seasoning and color of pastrami differs significantly from that of smoked meat. Pastrami comes in two flavors-\"old fashioned\" which is a process where the meat is naturally aged or cured and \"regular\" a process whereby additives are used to age the meat. Both the dish and the word were brought to North America with the wave of Jewish immigration from Bessarabia and Romania in the second half of the 19th century; it is similar to roast brisket, a signature dish of the local Jewish cuisine of these regions. Smoked meat, also known as salt beef in London, is cured, spiced, and flavoured in ways similar to corned beef. Difference in meat cut and spicing mean that smoked meat's taste is different from either of these, and even varies among recipes.\n\nSmoke meats from the southern United States, also known as Barbecue or BBQ were developed to use the \"cheaper\" cuts of meats, as they were typically tough and deemed \"undesirable\". The \"low and slow\" cooking methods tenderized the connective tissues in the meat and made these cuts a sought after delicacy. Usually done in a \"low temp\" environment of 200 to 300 °F (95 to 150 °C), they take a significant amount of time to prepare, which breaks down the connective tissues and collagens within the meat, and renders out the fat. A sub-category is the plethora of sauces and \"mops\" that are used to flavor and further tenderize the meats. BBQ has become a culinary art form, and hundreds of competitions are held yearly.\nIn the Southeast, pulled pork and pork ribs are the most common smoked meat, while brisket, beef ribs, and sausage are most popular in Texas and the central south. Chicken is also smoked throughout.\n\nOne study has shown an association between the frequency of consumption of smoked foods and intestinal cancer. However, the study was restricted to a small Slovenian population in Hungary, where the local smoke curing process produces levels of contaminants roughly eight times as high as standard processes elsewhere. Smoked meats have the potential for promoting the growth of \"Listeria\" bacteria. \"Listeria monocytogenes\" can also cause serious neonatal infection and can be transmitted from mother to child before or after birth. The infection can cause serious harm or even infant death.\n\n"}
{"id": "1093656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093656", "title": "Schmaltz", "text": "Schmaltz\n\nSchmaltz (also spelled schmalz or shmalz) is rendered (clarified) chicken or goose fat used for frying or as a spread on bread in Central European cuisine, and in the United States, particularly identified with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. Rendered waterfowl fat is also used in the cuisine of Southwestern France. As an effect of cross-cultural influences of the Jewish Ashkenazi, Polish, and Ukrainian cuisine, it is also popular in Poland and Ukraine, where rendered fats (including lard) are called \"smalec\", with schmaltz derived from geese being popular as \"gęsi smalec\".\n\nThe English term \"schmaltz\" is derived from Yiddish, and is cognate with the German term \"Schmalz\", meaning \"rendered animal fat\", regardless of source: both tallow and lard are considered forms of \"Schmalz\" in German, as is clarified butter. English usage tends to follow Yiddish, where it means poultry fat.\n\nThe term \"schmaltz\" entered English usage through Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews who used it to refer to kosher poultry fat; the word \"shmalts\" is the Yiddish word for rendered chicken fat. The word is common to the High German languages, including both Yiddish and modern Standard German, and comes from Middle High German \"Schmalz\", a noun derived from the verb \"schmelzen\", meaning \"to melt\". The verb can be traced back to the Germanic root \"smeltan\", which survives in the Modern English verb \"to smelt\".\n\nSchmaltz rendered from a chicken or goose was used by northwestern and eastern European Jews who were forbidden by kashrut (Jewish dietary laws) from frying their meats in butter or lard, the common forms of cooking fat in Northern Europe, as butter, being derived from milk, cannot be used with meat under the Jewish prohibition on mixing meat and dairy, and lard is derived from pork, an unkosher meat. Furthermore, tallow derived from beef or mutton would have been uneconomical, particularly given that virtually all suet (the raw material for tallow) is \"chelev\" and its consumption is forbidden. Northwestern and Eastern European Jews also could not obtain the kinds of vegetable-derived cooking oils such as olive oil and sesame oil, used in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean (as in Spain and Italy). Thus Ashkenazi Jews turned to poultry fat as their cooking fat of choice; the overfeeding of geese to produce more fat per bird produced modern Europe's first \"foie gras\" as a side effect.\n\nThe manufacture of schmaltz involves cutting the fatty tissues of a bird (chicken or goose) into small pieces, melting the fat, and collecting the drippings. Schmaltz may be prepared by a dry process where the pieces are cooked under low heat and stirred, gradually yielding their fat. A wet process also exists whereby the fat is melted by direct steam injection. The rendered schmaltz is then filtered and clarified.\n\nHomemade Jewish-style schmaltz is made by cutting chicken or goose fat into small pieces and melting in a pan over low-to-moderate heat, generally with onions. After the majority of the fat has been extracted, the melted fat is strained through a cheesecloth into a storage container. The remaining dark brown, crispy bits of skin and onion are known in Yiddish as \"gribenes\". Another simple method is as a by-product of the making of chicken soup. After the chicken is simmered in the pot or crock-pot, the broth is chilled so the fat rises to the top and can be skimmed off, at once providing schmaltz to set aside for other uses and a lower-fat soup, which is brought back to heat before serving.\n\nSchmaltz often has a strong aroma, and therefore is often used for hearty recipes such as stews or roasts.

{"id": "1093842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093842", "title": "Scutum (shield)", "text": "Scutum (shield)\n\nThe scutum (; plural \"scuta\"; ) was a type of shield used among Italic peoples in antiquity, and then by the army of ancient Rome starting about the fourth century BC. The Romans adopted it when they switched from the military formation of the \"hoplite\" phalanx of the Greeks to the formation with \"maniples\". In the former, the soldiers carried a round shield, which the Romans called a \"clipeus\". In the latter, they used the \"scutum\", which was a larger shield. Originally it was an oblong and convex shield. By the first century BC it had developed into the rectangular, semi-cylindrical shield that is popularly associated with the \"scutum\" in modern times. This was not the only shield the Romans used; Roman shields were of varying types depending on the role of the soldier who carried it. Oval, circular and rectangular shields were used throughout Roman history.\n\nIn the early days of ancient Rome (from the late regal period to the first part of the early republican period) Roman soldiers wore \"clipeus\", which were like the (), small round shields used in the Greek \"hoplite\" phalanx. The \"hoplites\" were heavy infantrymen who originally wore bronze shields and helmets. The phalanx was a compact, rectangular mass military formation. The soldiers lined up in very tight ranks in a formation which was eight lines deep. The phalanx advanced in unison, which encouraged cohesion among the troops. It formed a shield wall and a mass of spears pointing towards the enemy. Its compactness provided a thrusting force which had a great impact on the enemy and made frontal assaults against it very difficult. However, it worked only if the soldiers kept the formation tight and had the discipline needed to keep its compactness in the thick of the battle. It was a rigid form of fighting and its maneuverability was limited. The small shields provided less protection. However, their smaller size afforded more mobility. Their round shape enabled the soldiers to interlock them to hold the line together.\n\nSometime in the early fourth century BC, the Romans changed their military tactics from the \"hoplite\" phalanx to the \"manipular\" formation, which was much more flexible. This involved a change in military equipment. The \"scutum\" replaced the \"clipeus\". Some ancient writers thought that the Romans had adopted the \"maniples\" and the \"scutum\" when they fought against the Samnites in the first or second Samnite War (343-341 BC, 327-304 BC). However, Livy did not mention the \"scutum\" being a Samnite shield and wrote that the oblong shield and the \"manipular\" formation were introduced in the early fourth century BC, before the conflicts between the Romans and the Samnites. Plutarch mentioned the use of the long shield in a battle which took place in 366 BC. Couissin notes archaeological evidence shows that the \"scutum\" was in general use among Italic peoples long before the Samnite Wars and argues that it was not obtained from the Samnites. In some parts of Italy the \"scutum\" had been used since pre-historical times.\n\nPolybius gave a description of the early second century scutum: \n\nThe oval \"scutum\" is depicted on the Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome, the Aemilius Paullus monument at Delphi, and there is an actual example found at Kasr el-Harit in Egypt. Gradually the \"scutum\" evolved into the rectangular (or sub-rectangular) type of the early Roman Empire.\n\nBy the end of the 3rd century the rectangular \"scutum\" seems to have disappeared. Fourth century archaeological finds (especially from the fortress of Dura-Europos) indicate the subsequent use of oval or round shields which were not semi-cylindrical but were either dished (bowl-shaped) or flat. Roman artwork from the end of the 3rd century until the end of Antiquity show soldiers wielding oval or round shields.\n\nThe word \"\"scutum\"\" survived the Roman Empire and entered the military vocabulary of the Byzantine Empire. Even in the 11th century, the Byzantines called their armoured soldiers \"skutatoi\" (Grk. σκυτατοί).\n\nThe \"scutum\" was a \nlarge rectangle curved shield made from three sheets of wood glued together and covered with canvas and leather, usually with a spindle shaped boss along the vertical length of the shield. The best surviving example, from Dura-Europos in Syria, was high, across, and deep (due to its semicylindrical nature), with a thickness of 5-6mm., some source prove it weighed about 5.8kg (13 pounds) to 6.8kg (15 pounds)\n\nThe \"scutum\" was light enough to be held in one hand and its large height and width covered the entire wielder, making him very unlikely to get hit by missile fire and in hand-to-hand combat. The metal boss, or \"umbo\", in the centre of the \"scutum\" also made it an auxiliary punching weapon. Its composite construction meant that early versions of the \"scutum\" could fail from a heavy cutting or piercing blow, which was experienced in the Roman campaigns against Carthage and Dacia where the \"falcata\" and \"falx\" could easily penetrate and rip through it. The effects of these weapons prompted design changes that made the \"scutum\" more resilient such as thicker planks and metal edges.\n\nThe \"aspis\", which it replaced, was heavier and provided less protective coverage than the \"scutum\" but was much more durable.\n\nAccording to Polybius, the \"scutum\" gave Roman soldiers an edge over their Carthaginian enemies during the Punic Wars: \n\"Their arms also give the men both protection and confidence owing to the size of the shield.\"\n\nThe Roman writer Suetonius recorded an anecdote of the heroic centurion Cassius Scaeva, who fought under Caesar in the Battle of Dyrrachium:\n\nThe Roman writer Cassius Dio in his \"Roman History\" described Roman against Roman in the Battle of Philippi: \"For a long time there was pushing of shield against shield and thrusting with the sword, as they were at first cautiously looking for a chance to wound others without being wounded themselves.\"\n\nThe shape of the \"scutum\" allowed packed formations of legionaries to overlap their shields to provide an effective barrier against projectiles. The most novel (and specialised, for it afforded negligible protection against other attacks) use was the \"testudo\" (Latin for \"tortoise\"), which added legionaries holding shields from above to protect against descending projectiles (such as arrows, spears, or objects thrown by defenders on walls).\nDio gives an account of a \"testudo\" put to good use by Marc Antony's men while on campaign in Armenia:\nHowever, the \"testudo\" was not invincible, as Dio also gives an account of a Roman shield array being defeated by Parthian knights and horse archers at the Battle of Carrhae:\nCassius Dio describes \"scuta\" being used to aid an ambush:\n\nDio also notes the use of the \"scutum\" as a tool of psychological warfare during the capture of Syracuse:\nIn 27 BC, the emperor Augustus was awarded a golden shield by the senate for his part in ending the civil war and restoring the republic, according to the \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\". The shield, the \"Res Gestae\" says, was hung outside the Curia Julia, serving as a symbol of the \"princeps\" \"valour, clemency, justice and piety\".\nThe 5th century writer Vegetius added that \"scuta\" helped in identification:\nThe name Scutum has been adopted as one of the 88 modern constellations, and by UK luxury clothing maker Aquascutum, which became famous in the 19th century for its waterproof menswear. Hence the name, which in Latin means \"water shield\".\n\nIn zoology, the term \"scute\" or \"scutum\" is used for a flat and hardened part of the anatomy of an animal, such as the shell of a turtle.\n\n\n"}

It has the capacity to further express an individuals identity and personality as there are accessories that come in different, shapes, sizes, hues etc. The term came into use in the 20th century.\n\nFashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: those that are carried and those that are worn. Traditionally carried accessories include purses and handbags, glasses, hand fans, parasols and umbrellas, wallets, canes, and ceremonial swords. Accessories that are worn may include jackets, boots and shoes, cravats, ties, hats, bonnets, belts and suspenders, gloves, muffs, necklaces, bracelets, watches, sashes, shawls, scarves, lanyards, socks, pins, piercings, rings, and stockings.\n\nThe type of accessory that an individual chooses to wear or carry to complement their outfit can be determined by several factors including the specific context of where the individual is going. For example, if an individual is going to work their choice of accessory would differ to one who is going out to drinks or dinner thus depending on work or play different accessories would be chosen. Similarly, an individual's economical status, religious and cultural background would also be a contributing factor.\n\nIn Victorian fashion accessories such as fans, parasols and gloves held significance for how women experienced gender, race, and class. In this era, there was a trend for women to adopt, or aspire to, a more leisurely lifestyle. Consequently, gloves were often used by women to cover their hands and mask any signs of labor.\n\nAlso, in the early 16th century in Italy hat badges were worn by civilian men of higher social status as a decorative item, in imitation of the cap badges worn by the invading military. Hat badges were often worn in conjunction with a decorative sword and hilt. Hat badges were fashioned after plaquettes and often depicted a scene with personal relevance to the wearer. \n\nAs time has progressed fashion accessories have become more and more prominent in the immediate fashion world ranging from the runway to street wear. Today's generation of fashionistas has adopted a new way of wearing certain items to complete an outfit. Celebrities such as A$AP Rocky and Lil Uzi Vert have a unique style and have redefined what it means to wear an accessory. Many hurdles were cleared this year in the fashion world by icons such as Kanye West and Virgil Abloh, bringing freshness and innovation to the fashion industry. Virgil Abloh, CEO of Off-White and creative designer for Louis Vuitton, has paved a way for many trends to take off due to his usage of them in his runway shows consisting of the new \"Dad Shoe\" trend that's catching on quickly throughout many other big names such as Gucci and Balenciaga. Some other accessories that have gained popularity this year are side bags, clout glasses, long coats, and plaid designed articles. Although these trends are currently popular, fashion is an ever-changing field that adapts to its inhabitants. The future of fashion is always exciting and is credited with creating the most bizarre trends that seem to find its way to the closets of every inner city fashion enthusiast.\n\n"}

{"id": "1103679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1103679", "title": "Minjung", "text": "Minjung\n\nMinjung is a Korean word that combines the two hanja characters \"min\" and \"jung\". \"Min\" is from \"Inmin\" may be translated as \"people\" and \"jung\" is from \"Daejung\" which translated as \"public\". Thus, \"minjung\" literally means \"peoblic\", or more simply \"mass\" or \"the people.\"\n\nHowever, in the Korean political and cultural context, \"public\" is not an adequate translation, and \"the people\" carries a Communist connotation that makes it dangerous in anti-Communist South Korea. Nonetheless, \"the people\" is close to what \"minjung\" seeks to convey, both sociologically and politically. For Koreans, \"minjung\" are those who are oppressed politically, exploited economically, marginalized sociologically, despised culturally, and condemned religiously. For example, the Minjung Party founded in October 2017.\n\nThus, the notion of \"minjung\" came to identify and inform the struggle for democracy in South Korea. That is, the term \"minjung\" works as a kind of worldview that provides the categories in which social reality is organized and understood. One of the basic precepts of this worldview is that history should be understood from the point of view of the \"minjung\", or that the \"minjung\" are the subjects (and not victims) of history.\n\nThe idea of Minjung can be traced back to the late Joseon dynasty's Silhak movement through the works of Jeong Yak-yong and Yi Hwang.\n\nAfter the Korean War ended and South Korea ran its own government under their first president, Syngman Rhee, there were several military coups and forces involved in a reformation of the new government. Notably, there was President Park Chung-hee (1961–1979) and President Chun Doo-hwan.\n\nWhile \"Minjung\" (the mass of people) was suffering and struggling from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency, a major student uprising, and some American interference, managed to oust Syngman Rhee. Afterwards, a group of military officers led by General Park Chung-hee seized power in South Korea through a coup d' etat, and declared himself President. The period from 1965 to 1971 was one of rapid economic growth and comparative political stability. To achieve economic stability, Park Chung-hee created the first Five-Year Economic Development Plan (to start in 1962), the first such overall development program ever prepared for Korea. The five-year plan gave priority to the following things:\n\n\nPark ran for reelection in 1967, and became the president of the Third and Fourth Republic of Korea; he served for 16 years.\n\nIn August 1979, around 200 young female workers at YH Trading Company protested the company's decision to close down. YH had become a huge wig exporting company during the 1960s; however, the company's position had significantly deteriorated by the end of the 1970s.\n\nOn August 7, 1979, YH Company closed down. The young women workers protested and fasted against the company's closure. The police got involved and forcefully removed the women from the building. During this violent action, one young worker was killed. Her death was significant and triggered many protest movements throughout South Korea. It may be considered one of the most important sparks of opposition towards President Park Chung-hee and the demise of his presidency.\n\nThe Gwangju Democratization Movement, officially renamed the Gwangju Democratization Movement in 1987, began on May 18, 1980. The citizens of Gwangju, seeking the abolition of martial law and the resignation of General Chun Doo-hwan, initiated the movement. As General Chun Doo-hwan and the military tried to maintain martial law, students and some civilians came together to demonstrate their disapproval. On May 18, 200 male students tried to enter a school that was forced into closure by officials. During the attempt, the students were heavily injured. Seeing this, civilians decided to join in but were stopped by military forces. In the end, many civilians were injured and killed, thus starting the Gwangju Movement. On May 19, as the movement grew to 5000 civilians, the military brought in an armoured motorcar and marched in with guns wielding fixed-bayonets. On May 20, 200,000 civilians marched through the military force and stopped all communications systems in the city so the military would not bring in reinforcements. Thus, Gwangju was freed.\n\nChun Doo-hwan was the ROK army general and president of South Korea from 1980 to 1988. Chun started his coup by making himself head of the KCIA and keeping his position as head of the Defense Security of Command. Minjung gathered to the streets to protest and demonstrate their opinions about Chun's action. On May 17, 1980, Chun declared martial law to finalize his coup. Chun fired and arrested high officials and students who were opposed to his actions. On the next day, martial law was declared and about 500 people came together to Gwangju's streets to protest and demand the repeal of the martial law. \"One woman student was pilloried near the town square, where a paratrooper attacked her breasts with a bayonet.\" The soldiers shot and killed people who kept protesting and refused to go home. Gwangju Rebellion is also called Gwangju massacre because of the number of casualties inflicted on the protesters. It is unclear how many people actually died in the Gwangju Rebellion, but one source indicates the number to be between 2,300 to 4,900 deaths in May 1980.\n\nAs a result of this chaos, Chun took it upon himself to isolate about 37,000 journalists, students, teachers, labor organizers, and civil servants in condemned and confined camps up in the mountain areas to promote \"a time of cleansing their minds and spirits.\" Chun was not willing to let these movements go without making it very clear that he was not going to tolerate this. He said he was setting up these boot camps for those \"who would see the error of their ways after lots of push-ups, marathon running, small-group criticism and self-criticism, and ideological exhortation.\" \n\nThe 1980s marked a worldwide spark of democratization. The decline of the Soviet Union Bloc led to the breakdown of European Communist regimes in 1989. The Hungarian Solidarity Movement is one example of major revolutions during the 1980s. Much of dictatorships in Latin America also collapsed. In Philippines, the ousting of dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the subsequent \"yellow revolution\" led the way to democratization. These circumstances worldwide bear resemblance with the fall of the Chun regime, and the revolutions are akin to the Kwanju incident (albeit the discrepancies in human casualties). Scholar Samuel P. Huntington referred to this period as the \"Third Wave\" of Democratization.\n\nThe United States' supposed involvement in the Gwangju rebellion triggered the rapid spread of anti-Americanism sentiments. The protesters were expecting Americans to intervene for their side. Instead, the Twentieth Division of the ROK Army was sent to the area in response to the uprising. Although many Koreans, and especially those who had favored or participated in the uprising, blamed the U.S. Government for \"releasing\" these troops from their duties near the DMZ, the American general in charge of defending against North Korean (DPRK) attack had no idea that they were going to be moved. He was awakened by a late-night telephone call by the ROK president, informing him that the Twentieth had been removed from their positions along the DMZ—thus creating a huge gap in the defensive line in the event of large-scale infiltration from the North—and sent south to Gwangju. Nevertheless, because the U.S. Command was nominally in control of joint forces, the urban legend persists that the United States was responsible for the forcible repression of the uprising by military means. Because of this, the US took a portion of the blame:\n\nInitially, before Gwangju, there were negative attitudes towards the United States growing because of their support of Chun Doo-hwan. But Gwangju really catalyzed the Anti-Americanism among Koreans.\n\nDuring the presidential election in March 1960, Syngman Rhee sought out a fourth term. Considering his age of eighty-five, there was serious concern for Rhee's health and his future fulfillment of leadership within the Liberal Party. Therefore, in order to maintain power, the Liberal Party gained the desire to win at all costs. The Liberal Party did end up winning the election; Syngman Rhee and Yi Kibung (Vice President) officially won. However, the election process was corrupted. The \"ballot boxes had been stuffed with votes for the government candidates even before the voting took place.\" In reaction to the Liberal Party's rigged victory, the outraged citizens and students of all ages protested through street demonstrations. As a declaration indicting the government's abuse of power, on April 19, 1960, Yi Sujong expressed: \"We want to plant the seeds of reason, truth, freedom, and the spirit of the university in the barren soil of our country.\" Through the protest, the students became a power of influence among the people of Korea. Although the South Korean government had claimed to be a \"democratic\" nation, its actions did not display the exercise of democracy. The students sparked a vital movement in South Korea. These protests are evidence of students understanding of their own power and capabilities to influence the nation. Students were fervent in their search for their own rights because they learned from history. A middle schooler by the name of Kim Chu-yol in a sense became a symbol of the sacrifice for freedom. They needed to fight for their rights just like their fathers. \"Look at the torch of freedom that we are now raising! Listen, in these hours of darkness, as we proudly toll the bell of freedom, just as our fathers and elder brothers did under the iron yoke of the Japanese imperialist\". This was a new type of movement to which Korea was not accustomed which would be a key instrument in allowing students to begin to voice their opinions and fight for their rights.\n\nIn the 1960s, Park Chunghee saw normalization of relations with Japan as a way to gain start-up capital for industrial development. Mass demonstrations ensued against the signing of the normalization treaty. Demonstrators were met with military force in 1964, but in 1965, the treaty was ratified.\n\nFollowing the model of Liberation Theology established in the Latin American states, the Korean Catholic church became a haven for those opposing Park Chung-Hee's policies. This was largely due to governmental agencies', particularly the KCIA, reluctance to use military force against the church. The issues of democratization and evangelism were conflate, and some church leaders went so far as to lead protests against the authoritarian regime. The Minjung movement utilized theological arguments to support and legitimize the move towards a more democratic state. The model of Liberation Theology was viable in Korea due to the relatively high percentage of Koreans who practiced Christianity. (In 2005, approximately 1/3 of the Korean population claimed to be practicing Christians). The church provided a unique haven for anti-authoritarian dissent to develop.\n\nBorn in the southwestern province of Cholla, Kim Chi-ha is known for being a critic that played a large role in the Pak regime. Participation in anti-government activities, resulted in his multiple arrests which granted him the time to write a satire in experimental pan'sori form, \"Five Bandits\" (). This poem expresses his opposition towards the corrupt authoritarian government. \"The poem condemned the five core power groups of the Pak regime - business tycoons, members of the National Assembly of South Korea (legislature), senior government officials, generals, and cabinet ministers - as 'five bandits' who had brazenly acquired wealth by illicit means.\" As a result of the poem's publication, Kim Chiha was arrested on the charge of \"abetting the propaganda lines\" of North Korea. In 1974, Kim Chiha was sentenced to death for violating the National Security Act and instigating rebellion. However, due to protesters like: Willy Brandt, Jean-Paul Sartre and Oe Kenzaburo, he was released in 1979.\n\nOne of the great leaders of the cause was Kim Taejung (Kim Dae-jung), who stated that the economic development doesn't have to come with sacrifice of democracy and political freedom. Kim Taejung is often described as \"a fierce and articulate critic, Kim castigated the government for abuses of power, corruption, and the social inequities created thereby and made an appeal for those who had not shared in the economic growth or who had been victimized by human rights violations.\" Fierce critics such as Kim Taejung won wide popularity with the people of South Korea. Such men with devotion to steer the nation into a democratic nation fueled the students and white collars to achieve what we call Minjung movement today. With significant efforts from Minjung, \"a mass movement for democracy, embracing students, workers, and many in the middle class, finally brought a democratic breakthrough in Korea.\"\n\nSuch powerful leaders like Kim Taejung pay a price for standing up for what they believe in. He was \"subjected to frequent political persecution and even targeted for assassination attempts\". Through his devotion and criticism of an unfair government he was \"sentenced to death on a false charge\" which was later relieved through the United States. He still had to suffer by staying in jail for four years where he was under partial solitary confinement. Kim Taejung, undeterred, took advantage of his jail time to reflect and recharge. He worked through all the obstacles the government enforced such as \"being exiled to the United States\" and \"prohibited from engaging in political activities\". Kim Taejung would not have the reputation of a fierce and one of the many great leaders if he had not kept fighting as he did. He ran for presidency three times and finally was elected in 1997 \"marking the first time an opposition party candidate had won a presidential election in South Korea\".\n\nAccording to Kim Taejung democracy is essential to the people of South Korea because it gives the people some sense of ownership over their nation. It gives them freedom and motivates them to defend it. Kim Taejung admits that because of Korean's history and culture which was heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, it is difficult for South Korea to adapt to Democracy. Democracy is an idea that was invented by the Western civilization. However, this instrument can be used in South Korea if the people of South Korea want to serve under the principles of democracy which is freedom, justice, and human dignity. Kim Taejung argues that South Korea does yearn for democracy. Even when you look at the history of the Tonghak Rebellion, this resistance occurred because the peasants wanted equality and less corruption. Even before South Korea became a democratic nation, the people wanted this political government.\n\nKim Taejung believes that the most ideal economic system for a democratic nation would be a free enterprise system. However, he argues that although South Korea claims to be a democratic nation with free enterprise, this nation does not follow its principles. There is no free competition. South Korea is filled with big corporations with monopolies that are protected by the government which eliminates all competition. Also, he argues that in a free enterprise system, society and government should be able to provide and protect the working class. He even goes on to say that \"the workers in our country are the other major role players\". However, the authoritarian government abuses these workers and their freedom. They are treated unjustly and are not fairly rewarded. Also, there is no balance between the social classes. There is such a huge division between the higher class and the lower class which consists of farmers, workers, and small business men. In order for South Korea to break out of its shell, a balanced growth is necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, The infamous Asian financial crisis set forth in 1997, while the election was taking place. Foreign reserves were diminishing and economic issues such as high cost and low efficiency were threatening South Korea's investors. In his presidential inaugural address in February 1998, Kim Taejung addressed the economic standpoint of the country at the time. Kim also emphasized the importance of Korea's agriculture, farming, and foreign investments. Educational reform was highly encouraged and teaching future generations of societal values. He concluded by reflecting upon the thousands of years of heritage and fight for Korea's difficulties thus far.\n\n"}

In Australia, a short-lived product called Vegemite Singles combined Kraft Singles and Vegemite.\n\nKraft singles do not qualify for the US FDA Pasteurized Processed Cheese labeling. For this reason Kraft labels them Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product to avoid FDA sanctions. They were calling Kraft Singles Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Food until the FDA gave them a warning in December 2002 that the product could not be legally labeled as \"Pasteurized Processed Cheese Food\" due to the inclusion of milk protein concentrates. Kraft complied with the FDA order by changing the label to the current Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product.\n\nOne of the more famous ad campaigns involved the claim that each ¾ ounce slice contained \"five ounces of milk\", which makes them taste better than imitation cheese slices made mostly with vegetable oil and water and hardly any milk. The campaign was lambasted for its implications that each slice contained the same amount of calcium as a five-ounce glass of milk and also more calcium than imitation cheese slices, which eventually led to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission in 1992 that ordered Kraft to stop making false claims in its advertising.\n\nIn Australia, the Kraft branding was retired in 2017.

Hamburg steak is a similar product but differs in ingredients.\n\nPrior to the popularity of minced or ground beef like Salisbury steak in the United States, similar foods already existed in the culinary tradition of Europe. The Apicius cookbook, a collection of ancient Roman recipes that may date to the early 4th century, details a preparation of beef called \"isicia omentata\"; served as a baked patty in which minced or chopped beef is mixed with pine kernels, black and green peppercorns, and white wine, \"isicia omentata\" may be the earliest precursor to the hamburger. In the 12th century, the nomadic Mongols carried food made of several varieties of milk (\"kumis\") and meat (horse or camel). During the life of their leader Genghis Khan (1167–1227), the Mongol army occupied the western portions of the modern-day nations of Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, forming the so-called Golden Horde. This cavalry dominated army was fast moving and sometimes unable to stop for a meal, so they often ate while riding. They wrapped a few slices of meat under their saddles so it would crumble under pressure and motion and be cooked by heat and friction. This recipe for minced meat spread throughout the Mongol Empire until its split in the 1240s. It was common for Mongol armies to follow different groups of animals (such as herds of horses or oxen or flocks of sheep) that provided the necessary protein for the warriors' diets. Marco Polo also recorded descriptions of the culinary customs of the Mongol warriors, indicating that the flesh of a single pony could provide one day's sustenance for 100 warriors.\n\nWhen Genghis Khan's grandson Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, he and his warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This was later called \"steak tartare\". The city states of what is now Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets. One of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled \"Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburg Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.\n\nMinced meat was a delicacy in medieval cuisine, red meat usually being restricted to the higher classes. Very little mincing was done by medieval butchers or recorded in the cookbooks of the time, perhaps because it was not part of the sausage-making process that preserve meat. Russian ships brought recipes for steak tartare to the port of Hamburg during the 17th century, a time when there was such a great presence of Russian residents there that it was nicknamed \"the Russian port.\" Trade within the Hanseatic League between the 13th and 17th centuries made this port one of the largest in Europe, its commercial importance being further heightened as it became vital to early transatlantic voyages during the age of steam. In the period of European colonization of the Americas, immigrants to this port were a \"bridge\" between old European recipes and the future development of the hamburger in the United States.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, most of the northern European emigrants who traveled to the New World embarked on their transatlantic voyages from Hamburg. The German shipping company Hamburg America Line, also known as the \"Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft\" (HAPAG), was involved in Atlantic transport for almost a century. The company began operations in 1847 and employed many German immigrants, many of them fleeing the revolutions of 1848–9. The vast majority of settlers and emigrants from various parts of northern Europe also began voyages to the United States from Hamburg, introducing the culinary customs to state they come into. New York City was the most common destination for ships traveling from Hamburg, and various restaurants in the city began offering the Hamburg-style steak in order to attract German sailors. The steak frequently appeared on the menu as a \"Hamburg-style American fillet\", or even \"beefsteak à Hambourgeoise\". Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants, evoking memories of the port of Hamburg and the world they left behind.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the port of New York. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted and often smoked, and usually served raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs. The oldest document that refers to the Hamburg steak is a Delmonico's Restaurant menu from 1873 which offered customers an 11-cent plate of Hamburg steak that had been developed by American chef Charles Ranhofer (1836–1899). This price was high for the time, twice the price of a simple fillet of beef steak. However, by the end of the century the Hamburg steak was gaining popularity because of its ease of preparation decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day. Documents show that this preparation style was used by 1887 in some U.S. restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals; the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw egg.\n\nThe menus of many American restaurants during the 19th century included a Hamburg beefsteak that was often sold for breakfast. \n\nComing from this history is the Salisbury steak, which is usually served with a gravy similar in texture to brown sauce. Invented by Dr. James Salisbury (1823–1905), the term \"Salisbury steak\" has been used in the United States since 1897. Dr. Salisbury recommended this recipe for the treatment of alimentation (digestive problems):\nSalisbury steak remains popular in the United States, where it is traditionally served with gravy and mashed potatoes or pasta.\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture standards for processed, packaged \"Salisbury steak\" require a minimum content of 65% meat, of which up to 25% can be pork, except if de-fatted beef or pork is used, the limit is 12% combined. No more than 30% may be fat. Meat byproducts are not permitted; however, beef heart meat is allowed. Extender (bread crumbs, flour, oat flakes, etc.) content is limited to 12%, except isolated soy protein at 6.8% is considered equivalent to 12% of the others. The remainder consists of seasonings, fungi or vegetables (onion, bell pepper, mushroom or the like), binders (can include egg) and liquids (such as water, milk, cream, skim milk, buttermilk, brine, vinegar etc.). The product must be fully cooked, or else labeled \"Patties for Salisbury Steak\".\n\nThe standards for hamburger limit the meat to beef only, and of skeletal origin only. Salt, seasonings and vegetables in condimental proportions can be used, but liquids, binders and/or extenders preclude the use of the term \"hamburger\" or \"burger\". With these added, the product is considered \"beef patties\".\n\nProducts not made in USDA-inspected establishments are not bound by these standards and may be bound by other standards which vary from country to country.\n\nHamburg steak is a very similar dish.\n\nIn Sweden, \"Pannbiff\" is similar to a Salisbury steak and is often made by a mix of ground pork and beef, chopped onions, salt and pepper. It is served with boiled potatoes, gravy made from cream, caramelized onions and lingonberries. It is a very traditional dish that is common in the \"husman\" cuisine.\n\nMinced cutlet (котлета рубленая, \"kotleta rublenaya\"), or, since the late 19th century, simply \"cutlet\", is a staple of Russian cuisine. It is similar to a Salisbury steak, with the main difference being pure beef is rarely employed, usually pork or a beef-pork mixture is used. The meat is seasoned with salt and pepper, mixed with finely chopped onion (optionally fried), garlic, and a binder (eggs and breadcrumbs soaked in milk), divided into oval-shaped patties, lightly breaded and shallow-fried in a half-inch of vegetable oil. The transliterated Japanese dish, \"menchi katsu\", is always deep-fried and heavily breaded, being essentially a mincemeat croquette, while the Russian version is always shallow-fried.\n\nGrillsteaks are a similar product \n\n"}

Chivas Regal traces its roots back to 1801. Chivas Regal's home is Strathisla distillery at Keith, Moray in Speyside, Scotland, the oldest operating Highland distillery, which was founded in 1786.\n\nIt is the market-leading Scotch whisky 12 years and above in Europe and Asia Pacific. Chivas Regal sales grew by 61% between 2002 and 2008. In global terms, Chivas Regal recorded volume sales of 4.9 million nine-litre cases in 2012 and 2013 but sales have decreased steadily since, dropping to 4.4 million cases in 2015.\n\n\nChivas Brothers traces its roots to the opening of a grocery store at 13 King Street, Aberdeen, in 1801. The store sold luxury foodstuffs such as coffee, exotic spices, French brandies, and Caribbean rums to a wealthy clientele. In 1842, Chivas Brothers was retained to supply provisions to the royal family at Balmoral Castle upon Queen Victoria's first visit to Scotland.\n\nIn 1843, Chivas Brothers was granted a Royal Warrant to supply goods to Queen Victoria. The May 8, 1890 edition of \"Scotland Magazine\" described Chivas Brothers as \"undoubtedly the finest purveying business in the north of Scotland\".\n\nDuring the 1850s James Chivas decided to respond to his affluent customers' demands for a smoother whisky, by beginning to blend whiskies to create a blend proprietary to Chivas Brothers. The firm's first blended Scotch whisky, Royal Glen Dee, was launched, followed in the 1860s by a second proprietary blended Scotch whisky, Royal Strathythan.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Chivas Brothers decided to create its most aged blended Scotch whisky to export to the United States, where the booming economy after the turn of the century was fueling demand for luxury goods. The whisky was named Chivas Regal.\n\nChivas Regal 25 Year Old was launched in 1909 as the original luxury Scotch, and became a leading brand in the United States. Chivas Regal continued its success until Prohibition in the 1920s. \n\nChivas Regal was purchased by Seagrams in 1949, which enabled a much wider distribution and marketing system.\n\nIn 1950, the company was able to buy the Strathisla Distillery, which produces the Strathisla single malt whisky used in the Chivas Regal blend.\n\nChivas Regal was re-launched as Chivas Regal 12 year old in the US following the disruption of both Prohibition and World War II. Chivas became a fashionable brand of the era, and became associated with Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. Chivas Regal was the Scotch whisky requested by Sinatra, along with other spirits brands backstage at performances, and Chivas sponsored his Diamond Jubilee Tour in 1990.\n\nIn 1997, the Chivas Regal range was expanded with the launch of longer aged whiskies, with the launch of Chivas Regal 18 year old, and in 2007 with the launch of Chivas Regal 25. \n\nChivas Regal was acquired by Pernod Ricard following a joint bid with Seagram Spirits & Wine in December 2000 by Pernod Ricard and Diageo.\n\nThe home of Chivas Regal and location of its visitor centre is located at the Strathisla distillery. The distillery was founded in 1786, and is the oldest working distillery in the Highlands of Scotland, located in Speyside. The Strathisla distillery is owned by Chivas Brothers, and Strathisla single malt is one of the malt whiskies used within the Chivas Regal blend. Strathisla single malts have a natural sweetness and help to define the taste of Chivas Regal.\n\nChivas Regal whiskies have performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. In 2013, the San Francisco World Spirits Competition jury awarded its Double Gold Medals to the Chivas Regal 18yr, 21yr and 25yr whiskies.\n\nIn the 1973 film \"The Exorcist\", the character Father Dyer brings this whisky for Father Karass to drink after the death of his mother. They share it and he remarks \"Chivas Regal! Where'd you get the money for it—out of the poor box?\"\n\nWithin the first six minutes of the film \"The Spook Who Sat by the Door\" (1973), the top 10 African-American candidates for the CIA \"spook\" position toast to their success to that point, and one notes the Chivas Regal they are drinking costs $3.\n\nIn Only Fools And Horses Series 2, episode 3, A Losing Streak, first broadcast in 1982 Delboy asks for a 'Large Chivas Regal' at the bar to try and impress Boycie.\n\nIn Working Girl, from 1988, savvy New York City receptionist Tess McGill played by Melanie Griffith orders a \"Chivas\" during an engagement party for her friend Cynthia (Joan Cusack), immediately prior to a proposal from her boyfriend Mick Dugan played by Alec Baldwin.\n\nKelly Clarkson's 2007 album \"My December\" includes a hidden track entitled \"Chivas\". The track is about an ex she ran into at a bar while drinking Chivas.\n\nIn the \"Mad Men\" season 6 episode, \"The Better Half\", Ted Chaough compares Fleishchmann's margarine to Chivas Regal (because it's a relatively expensive brand of margarine), while Don Draper compares it to Ballantine Beer (because he compares margarine to butter).\n\nIn the \"American Dad!\" season 6 episode, \"Spring Break-Up\", Roger (as \"Scotch Bingington\") invites Spring Breakers to party at the Smith household. As the self-proclaimed \"King of Spring Break,\" he has a staff that dispenses Chivas Regal.\n\nAuthor Hunter S.

{"id": "1106501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106501", "title": "Streetball", "text": "Streetball\n\nStreetball or street basketball is a variation of basketball, typically played on outdoor courts, featuring significantly less formal structure and enforcement of the game's rules. As such, its format is more conducive to allowing players to publicly showcase their own individual skills. Streetball may also refer to other urban sports played on asphalt. It is particularly popular and important in New York City.\n\nSome places and cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, operated similarly to midnight basketball programs. Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments, with Hoop-It-Up and the Houston Rockets' Blacktop Battle being two of the most popular. Since the mid-2000s, streetball has seen an increase in media exposure through television shows such as ESPN's \"Street Basketball\" and \"City Slam\", as well as traveling exhibitions such as the AND1 Mixtape Tour, YPA, and Ball4Real.\n\nIt is also popular in other countries like Philippines. Most of their streets have their own basketball court. Tournaments are also organized especially during summer and holiday season. Divisions are divided into 4 brackets, Mosquito (ages 7 to 13), Midget (ages 14 to 17), Junior, (ages 18 to 25),and Senior division (ages 26 and up).\n\nStreetball rules vary widely from court to court.\n\nPlayers typically divide into teams by alternating choices.\n\nNo referees are employed, so almost invariably a \"call your own foul\" rule is in effect, and a player who believes he has been fouled, simply needs to call out \"Foul!\", and play will be stopped, with the ball awarded to the fouled player's team (free throws are not awarded in streetball).\n\nCalling fouls is generally disfavored. The etiquette of what rightly constitutes a foul, as well as the permissible amount of protestation against such a call, are the products of individual groups, and of the seriousness of a particular game.\n\nOther violations which are enforced include traveling, double-dribble, carrying, kicking, goaltending, and backcourt.\n\nSince there are not always enough players to play on a full court (typically 4-on-4 is a minimum for full court) and full-court games are more physically demanding, the majority of Streetball games are played on a half court. Special rules have been developed for half-court play:\n\nAt the beginning of the game and after each made basket, play begins at the top of the key. A \"checking\" system is used to ensure that both teams are ready to begin play. This involves the offensive player saying \"check\" while throwing the ball to his defender. The defender then makes sure his/her team is ready and then throws the ball back to begin play.\n\nIf the ball goes out of bounds during play, the ball can either be checked from out of bounds near where the ball went out or at the top of the key, depending on the rules established before the game.\n\nFIBA recently had to add the ‘check clock’ rule into play in their streetball tournaments due to some players taking excruciatingly long amounts of time to check the ball, interrupting the flow of play. This ‘check clock’ means that when the defending player has been checked the ball, he has to return it within 5 seconds.\n\nIf the defending team gains possession of the ball through a steal, block, or rebound, they must take the ball out to beyond the three-point line before they can score a basket. This does not need to be at the top of the key and no checking is required. This is analogous to taking the ball to the other side of the court in a full-court game.\n\nA common feature of street basketball is the \"pick up game\". To participate in most streetball games around the world, one simply goes to an outdoor court where people are playing, indicates a wish to participate, and from all the players who were at the court before one has played, two players acting as \"captains\" will get to pick their team out of the players available and play a game. Generally, the team captains alternate their choices, but different courts have differing rules in regards to player selection. Many games play up to 7, 11, 13, 15, or 21 points with baskets counting for 1 and 2 points. It is possible to do (1's only), (2's only), (1's and 2's), (2's and 3's) or (1's, 2's and 3's)\n1's only - each basket counts as 1 point\n2's only - each basket counts as 2 points\n1's and 2's - each basket counts as 1 point if inside the arc, or 2 points if outside the arc\n2's and 3's - each basket counts as 2 points if inside the arc, or 3 points if outside the arc\n1's, 2's and 3's - You need at least 3 teams for this, baskets count as 1 or 2 points until one of the 3 teams score a certain number of points, then the other 2 teams play for second place with baskets counting for 2 and 3 points\nPlayers often play 'win by 2' which, as in tennis, means that the team has to win by a margin of at least 2 points. Sometimes a local \"dead end\" limit applies; for instance a game may be played to 7, win by 2, with a 9-point dead end, (referred to as \"7 by 2's, 9 straight\") which would mean scores of 7-3, 8-6, or 9-8 would all be final, while with scores of 7-6 or 8-7, play would continue. The most common streetball game is 3 on 3 played half court, though 5 on 5 full court can be found. Another common variation to the rules is the \"skunk\" rule. This merely means that if a player reaches a certain point without the other player scoring, the game is over. The skunk rule limit can vary, but is often used at the score 7 to 0.\n\nSometimes in a half-court game, a \"\"winner's ball\"\" or \"make it, take it\" rule is used. This means that if a team scores, it gets the ball again on offense; one team could end up never getting the ball on offense if the other team scores on every possession. Full court basketball is not played with these rules, but, in most instances, the winning team gets to choose which basketball and usually which direction (which basket) they get to use. Also, if the ball goes out of bounds players must check up.\n\nAnother possible streetball feature is having an MC call the game. The MC is on the court during the game and is often very close to the players (but makes an effort to not interfere with the game) and uses a microphone to provide game commentary for the fans.\n\nIf the player loses the match of a 1v1 (\"one-on-one\", two players competing alone), the losing player is given a second chance to shoot a shot at the three point line. This either results with the match continuing or if the match is close enough resulting in a tie. \n\nIn a game of 1v1, in a close game the game cannot end on a bank shot. If a bank shot happens on the last point of the game it is a replay of possession.\n\nA popular variation of street basketball is \"21\", also known as \"Hustle,\" \"American,\" \"St. Mary's,\" a \"V or Varsity,\" \"Roughhouse,\" 33, 50 or \"Crunch,\" or \"New York.\" 21 is played most often with 3-5 players on a half court, typically when not enough players have arrived at the playground to \"run 3's\" (play 3-on-3). However it is possible to play \"21\" with only two players, or more than 5.\n\nFurther, in some forms, players can freely enter the game after it has begun, starting at zero points or being \"spotted\" the same number as the player with the lowest score. \"21\" is an \"every player for himself\" game, with highly variable rules. The rules of \"21\" are usually agreed by the players at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe typical rules of \"21\" are:\n\nCommon additional rules include:\n\n\"21\" is considered a very challenging game, especially because the offensive player must possibly go up against several defenders at the same time. For this reason, it is exceedingly difficult to \"drive to the hole\" and make lay-ups in \"21.\" Therefore, and also because of the emphasis on free-throws, \"21\" is very much a shooter's game, and because a successful shot means you keep the ball, it is possible for there to be come-backs when a player recovers from a large deficit by not missing any shots (this can also result in failure when they miss their final free-throw at 20 points and revert to 13 or 15 etc.).\n\n\"21\" is popular because it allows an odd number of people to play, unlike regular basketball or other variants.\n\nAnother less common streetball variant, often referred to as \"King of the Court\", or \"Boston\", results in essentially a one-on-one (or sometimes two-on-two) tournament between any number of players. Each match is played following normal one-on-one rules, including violations (such as fouls and out-of-bounds) to just one point. The winner remains on the court and gets to take the ball out while the loser returns to the end of the line of players waiting to step on the court. The first player to win a set number of matches (usually 7 or 11) wins the game.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1106701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106701", "title": "Cortado", "text": "Cortado\n\nA cortado is a beverage consisting of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity. The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and \"texturized\" as in many Italian coffee drinks.\n\nThe word \"cortado\" is the past participle of the Spanish verb \"cortar\" (to cut), in the sense of \"dilute\", and can refer variously to either coffee or espresso drinks throughout Spain, Portugal and Cuba.\n\nIn Spain a \"café solo corto\" or a \"café cortado\" generally both refer to single espresso shots with foam, while the term \"cortado\" is itself broadly associated with various coffee or espresso beverages having been \"cut\" with milk. The café solo corto may in fact be interchangeable with the Italian macchiato or similar to the French noisette. \n\nThe \"cortadito\" in Cuba specifically implies a small beverage similar to the café solo corto consisting of a standard 1oz espresso shot; however, unlike the solo corto, the Cuban cortadito is generally cut with heated sweetened condensed milk, being a more available preserved form of milk, whereas fresh milk was historically often unavailable. A \"cortadito\" is usually served in a special glass, often with a metal ring base and a metal wire handle. There are several nominal variations, including \"cortado condensada\", \"café con leche condensada\" or \"bombón\" (espresso with condensed milk); \"leche y leche\" is a similar variation, but with both condensed milk integrated throughout and a dollop of cream resting on top. Brought to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida, by Cuban-Americans in the 1960s, the cortadito drink is now found throughout the city, and is an important part of everyday culture, particularly among Cubans. However, the cortadito is a drink distinct from Cuban-style coffee, which includes sugar in addition to milk, and has its own brewing method as espresso.\n\nIn non Spanish-speaking countries where it appears on a specialty coffee menu, however, the cortado should generally be distinguished from the Italian caffè macchiato, cappuccino, or a flat white. A macchiato has only a small amount (a 'mark' or spot) of milk foam added, while a cappuccino has a head from both foam and milk. A flat white is generally made with a similar equivalent ratio of espresso to milk, but uses steamed and textured (e.g. microfoam) milk, resulting in a hotter and lighter drink, more closely related to a latte.\n\nA similar drink in Australia is known as a \"piccolo latte,\" or simply a \"piccolo\". This is a single ristretto shot in a macchiato glass that is filled with steamed milk in the same fashion as a cafe latte. A larger drink, popular in Portugal, is the \"galão,\" which uses 1:3 proportions but is otherwise similar to both cortados and manchados.\n\nIn Catalan, \"tallat\" takes the role of describing being \"cut\", with the closest word in Basque being \"ebaki\", and \"pingado\" or \"garoto\" in Portuguese. In the United States the meaning of the name can vary by region but on the East Coast it is generally known as a \"cortado\". In the Czech Republic, Costa Coffee sells cortado under the marketing name \"corto classic\".\n\nThe name \"gibraltar\" originated in San Francisco, California, where roasters – first Blue Bottle Coffee Company, later Ritual Coffee Roasters and others – started the cortado trend by serving the drink in Libbey Glass Company glassware by the same name.\n\nWhereas a cortado is a broader term for many a cut beverage, a \"gibraltar\" is specifically defined in its proportions by the constraints of its cup size: a Libbey 'Gibraltar' glass contains 4.5 oz, 2 oz of which are filled by a standard double espresso shot and the remainder filled by well-integrated microfoam. It was developed as a readily available profiling beverage for immediate consumption, and is typically identifiable from cortados as having a richer, more velvety texture and a cooler, lukewarm temperature. Because of its temperature, emulsified milk integration, immediate consumption and lowered acidity, the gibraltar is especially good for profiling naturals with their hints of strawberry or blueberry. \n\n"}

The majority of its UK sales are during the Christmas period.\n\nMatthew Gloag was a grocer and wine merchant at 22 Athole Street Perth, Scotland. Gloag purchased whiskies from distilleries around Scotland, and when Queen Victoria visited Perth in 1842, he was invited to supply the wines for the royal banquet.\n\nIn 1860, his son, William Gloag, took over the company. Following the Great French Wine Blight the company began to look at creating its own blended whiskies around 1875. In 1896, William's nephew, Matthew Gloag (1850-1912), took over the family business. He created a new blended brand called The Grouse in 1896. at this time the company was still operating from the grandfather's premises but had expanded to occupy adjacent shops, jointly covering 20 to 26 Atrhiole street. In 1905 the limited company of Matthew Gloag & son was formed and the Grouse was renamed The Famous Grouse in the same year. Matthew Gloag's daughter Phillippa first designed the label's grouse icon. Only at this point did the company move to new purpose-built premises on Kinnoull Street.\n\nIn 1970, Matthew Gloag & Son, owned by the Gloag family, was sold to Highland Distillers, after the death of the chairman, Matthew Frederick Gloag. The marketing and distributive power of the company saw Famous Grouse become the highest selling Scotch in Scotland by 1980 and the second highest selling in the United Kingdom. From the 1980s the brand began to be exported overseas, where it now sells over 2 million cases annually. In 1984 The Famous Grouse was awarded the Royal Warrant.\n\nThe standard blend is 40% ABV.\n\nThe blend is matured in oak casks for up to six months at 46% ABV.\n\nIn 2007 a peated special version of The Famous Grouse called The Black Grouse developed for the Swedish market was released. The packaging displays a black grouse in place of the usual red grouse. The following year a special version, meant for chilling, was released called Snow Grouse. The packaging features a ptarmigan.\n\nThe Famous Grouse has focussed its television advertising around the Christmas period since 1996.\n\nThe Famous Grouse was the primary sponsor of the Perth-based football team St Johnstone between 1986 and 1989 and again between 1991 and 1998. It also sponsored the Scotland national rugby union team from 1990 until 2007, and was 'The Official Spirit of Scottish Rugby' from 2013 for three years.\n\nIn May 2014, Famous Grouse was named the Official Whisky of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n"}

While dnL remained listed as an official product of the company in late 2005, it was scheduled to be discontinued for 2006 in favor of the 7 Up Plus brand.\n\nThe product's name came from the fact that the \"dnL\" logo is the \"7 Up\" logo rotated 180°. As such, the product itself was, in many ways, the polar opposite of 7 Up: while 7 Up is caffeine-free, colorless, and comes in a green bottle, dnL contained caffeine, was colored vaguely similar to the green of 7 Up's bottle, and came in a clear bottle. And while 7 Up has a fairly standard lemon-lime flavor, dnL was a stronger lime-lemon/citrus flavor.\n\nIt was featured in SSX 3 as its sponsored drink.\n\nThe limited amount of marketing created for dnL focused on its \"upside-down\" theme, including its slogan, \"\"Turn your thirst upside-down.\"\" The color was also similar to Pepsi's Mountain Dew soft drink, and, like Mountain Dew, was developed primarily to compete with The Coca-Cola Company's Sprite, Fanta, and Mello Yello.\n\n"}

The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. Somewhat similar in texture to European pancakes crossed with a popover or Yorkshire pudding, æbleskiver are solid like a pancake but light and fluffy like a popover. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.\n\nÆbleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\n\nThe batter for æbleskiver usually includes wheat flour, which is mixed with buttermilk, milk or cream, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Some recipes also include fat (usually butter), cardamom and lemon zest to improve taste, and a leavening agent, most often baking powder, but sometimes yeast, to aerate the batter.\n\nBatter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the æbleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of apple (\"æble\") or applesauce inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, black currant or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nÆbleskiver can be bought fried and frozen at supermarkets, only needing heating in an oven.\n\nIn Denmark æbleskiver are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gløgg, Scandinavian mulled wine. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar. They are also served at children's birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\n\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate æbleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \"Æbleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1113355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113355", "title": "Miller Lite", "text": "Miller Lite\n\nMiller Lite, is a 4.2% ABV American light pale lager sold by MillerCoors of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. Miller Lite competes with Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light beer. The company also produces Miller Genuine Draft and Miller High Life. It is also the Official Beer Sponsor of the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, Milwaukee Bucks, and Bellator MMA, as well as being a primary sponsor of Brad Keselowski's No. 2 Ford Mustang in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nMiller Lite was the first successful mainstream light beer in the United States market. After its first inception as \"Gablinger's Diet Beer\", developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \"Lite\" on packaging and in advertising (with \"Lite Beer from Miller\" being its \"official\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Providence, Rhode Island, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of \"Lite\" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called \"Bud Light\" as \"everything else is just a light\". In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its \"Lite\" brand as \"Miller Lite\".\n\nIn 2008, Miller Brewing Company test-marketed three new recipes – an amber, a blonde ale, and a wheat – under the Miller Lite brand, marketed as Miller Lite Brewers Collection.\n\nIn December 2013, as part of a product placement marketing campaign with the film \"\", Miller reintroduced the 1974 navy-blue blackletter font \"Lite\" packaging on its cans for a limited time (the original 1972 cans used a light-blue script logo). However, the vintage packaging was such a success that by September 2014, the company decided to switch back to the vintage packaging full-time, including on bottles and tap handles, mirroring the unexpected success that PepsiCo had in 2009 with its Pepsi Throwback & Mountain Dew Throwback lines in tapping into the retro-themed packaging market. The unexpected sales increase, combined with wanting to differentiate the packaging from Bud Light, were factors in the decision, with some consumers even stating that Miller actually improved on the taste when nothing changed in the beer itself.\n\nMiller Lite Great American Beer Festival's silver medal in 2003 in the same category. At the 2010 and 2014 Great American Beer Festival, Miller Lite won the gold medal for Best American Style Lager or Light Lager, beating out Miller Genuine Draft, which received the bronze. The beer debuted at #1 on the list of top 100 beers of all time by Cold Cans.\n\nMiller Lite's long-running \"Tastes Great!...Less Filling!\" advertising campaign was ranked by \"Advertising Age\" magazine as the eighth best advertising campaign in history. The campaign was developed by the advertising agency McCann-Erickson Worldwide. In the prime of the campaign, television commercials typically portrayed a Lite Beer drinker noting its great taste followed by another who observed that it was less filling. This usually led to a parody of Wild West saloon fights in which every patron got involved in the dispute for no real reason, though in this case it was always a shouting match, and blows were never thrown. The commercials were closed with a voiceover from actor Eddie Barth, who read the slogan, \"\"Lite Beer from Miller: Everything you've always wanted in a beer. And less.\"\"\n\nThe then-recently retired New York Jets running back Matt Snell was the first person to appear in Miller Lite's first commercial in 1973.\n\nTo attract 'Joe Sixpack' to a light beer, these commercials started to feature both elite ex-athletes such as Ray Nitschke, Ben Davidson, and Bubba Smith but also oddball cultural figures such as Mickey Spillane (accompanied by a blonde, Lee Meredith, who is better known for her role as Ulla, the secretary in \"The Producers\"), and comedian Rodney Dangerfield. As the series of commercials went on, it began featuring athletes and celebrities of all sorts. Some commercials from this era include:\n\n\nAs the popularity of the ads and the number of athletes and celebrities that appeared in them grew, Miller produced occasional \"alumni\" ads featuring all of the stars, generally in some sort of competition between the 'Less Fillings' and the 'Taste Greats'. The ads usually ended with Rodney Dangerfield somehow being the goat of the losing team. In one of the last spots to feature Dangerfield, the Miller Lite alumni are competing in a bowling match. It is the last frame of a tie game, and Ben Davidson grumbles to Dangerfield, \"All we need is \"one\" pin, Rodney.\" Dangerfield rolls the ball down the lane, only to have it bounce horizontally off the head pin and into the gutter, knocking down zero pins.\n\nAs part of this campaign, Miller Brewing ran a series of highly distinctive television commercials in the winter of 1993–1994 showing several fictitious \"extreme sports\" such as \"Wiener Dog Drag Racing\" (which featured two wiener dogs racing each other at a drag racing strip), \"Sumo High Dive\" (which depicted a Japanese sumo wrestler diving off a platform) and \"The Miss Perfect Face-Off\" (which featured beauty pageant contestants playing ice hockey). The tag line that followed was, \"If you can combine great taste with less filling, you can combine anything.\" and the question \"Can your beer do this?\"\n\nIn 1995-1996, Miller Lite ran the \"Life Is Good\" campaign, which showed Miller Lite drinkers' aspirational transition to more fun via a Miller Lite bottle tap, like \"Beach Rewind\", where three men on a beach admired three beautiful women walking by, and could rewind, and enjoy, the scene repeatedly. The campaign was developed by Leo Burnett Company, and received the American Marketing Association EFFIE award for outstanding advertising effectiveness. The campaign included celebrities such as Larry Bird, Keith Jackson, and Richard Karn.\n\nBeginning January 12, 1997, a series of surrealistic Miller Lite ads, purportedly made by a man named \"Dick\", began to air. They were hallmarked as such either at the beginning or the end of the commercial. The campaign was developed by Minneapolis-based ad agency Fallon. The series of \"Dick\" commercials was directed by Gerald Casale of the new wave band Devo. Such commercials include one where a middle-aged man sees the message \"twist to open\" on a Miller Lite bottle cap, and he proceeds to do the Twist.\nThe ad campaign changed back to using high-profile celebrities who were either on opposite ends of the spectrum or had bragging rights to exchange with the other. Notable pairings included the following:\n\n\nIn 2002, \"Catfight\", another high-profile commercial in the long-running \"Great Taste...Less Filling\" campaign, was denounced by critics as depicting women as sexual objects. The commercial featured two women, a blonde (Tanya Ballinger) and a brunette (Kitana Baker), discussing the classic \"Great Taste/Less Filling\" debate, except they engaged in a catfight, hence the ad's title, with the fight moving from a fountain to a mud pit, with the girls stripping each other of their clothing in the process. An uncensored version of the commercial ended in the muddy beauties, stripped down to their underwear, sharing a passionate kiss. The girls received much publicity from the commercial, and later starred in a few related commercials, videos and events.\n\nIn 2006, Miller Lite had an advertising campaign called Man Laws featuring celebrities that include actor Burt Reynolds, professional wrestler Triple H, comedian Eddie Griffin, and former American football player Jerome Bettis. The celebrities and other actors were in a \"Men of the Square Table\", a group meeting where they discuss different situations that should be included in the \"Man Laws\". The ads were developed by the ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky/Miami, and were directed by comedy film director Peter Farrelly.\n\nIn June 2010, commercials premiered featuring actresses Lindsey McKeon and Nadine Heimann as bartenders.\n\nMiller Brewing Company began their NASCAR sponsorship in 1983 with driver Bobby Allison, advertising the Miller High Life brand and later in 1990 with driver Rusty Wallace, advertising the Miller Genuine Draft brand. In 1997, the company began advertising the Miller Lite brand on Wallace's #2 Penske Racing car. The car later earned the nickname \"Blue Deuce\", due to its number and blue paint scheme. Wallace retired following the 2005 season, and Kurt Busch was named as his replacement. Busch drove the \"Blue Deuce\" from 2006 to 2010. The car is currently driven by Brad Keselowski, who won the 2012 Sprint Cup Series championship.\n\nOther promotion in motorsport included the sponsoring of Don Prudhomme's Larry Dixon-driven NHRA top fuel dragster from 1997 to 2007. Prior to that, Dixon was sponsored by Miller Genuine Draft. Additionally, Miller Brewing sponsored the Unlimited hydroplane of R.B. \"Bob\" Taylor in 1984 with the U-7 \"Lite All-Star\", driven by Tom D'Eath. The following year, Miller switched teams and brands with the \"Miller American\" Unlimited hydroplane owned by Fran Muncey and Jim Lucero—which resulted in the 1985 National Championship, and APBA Gold Cup wins in 1985, 1986, and 1987, driven by Chip Hanauer.\n\nFor the first time in a video game, it was featured in NASCAR '15: Victory Edition and NASCAR Heat Evolution as a sponsor available to users verified to be over 21 years of age.\n\n"}
{"id": "1117176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117176", "title": "Ainu music", "text": "Ainu music\n\nAinu music is the musical tradition of the Ainu people of northern Japan.\n\nThe oral Ainu culture includes various genres, of which upopo, lighthearted ballads on daily affairs and rituals often accompanied by traditional Ainu instruments, and yukar (mimicry), a form of rhythmic epic poetry often supported by light percussion, are most prominently covered in writings on this oral Ainu culture.\n\nThe contents of these ballads were an important source of understanding daily life as well as various traditions and habits of the Ainu people, and today these remain an important part in protecting the Ainu cultural identity, as seen in efforts by performers such as Oki, the most famous contemporary performer of Ainu music.\n\nThe most useful English-language overview of Ainu music (with recordings and transcriptions) is by Chiba Nobuhiko.\n\nAinu music carries spiritual resonance in almost all of its forms, and it has played an important role in both the cultural history and the cultural renaissance of the Ainu people. Almost every type of Ainu song is sacred, and even the musical instruments are said to be imbued with souls. Traditional Ainu music can be divided into two major groups — everyday songs and epic songs. Everyday songs in Ainu tradition were sung in many situations and on an impromptu basis. They were often accompanied by the two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments: the \"tonkori\", a plucked zither, and the \"mukkuri\", a jaw harp played by women.\n\nThese everyday songs are short, fairly simple, and center on an activity like a game or work. The act of singing is itself used as a game in some instances, such as Rekuhkara (Ainu throat-singing) competitions between women. Work songs are rhythmic, with lyrics and melodies based on the work with which they are sung. However, even such everyday songs have sacred rather than mundane meanings. \"Chants like the \"kar upopo\" (sake-making song) and the \"iyuta upopo\" (the pounding song)…are not labor songs; rather, they are magic-oriented, for they are sung to ward off evil spirits\". Short, everyday songs are also a way of praying. \nThese prayer songs are (or were) performed regularly before meals, after a fishing trip, to ask for luck in hunting, and in many other contexts. Unfortunately, material about everyday songs is very difficult to obtain. Many have never been recorded.\n\nAinu epic songs, \"yukar\", are performed as long monologues. The singer performs the song entirely from memory, and, traditionally, in a \"non-formal\" setting such as a friend’s house or before the hearth at a gathering. While somewhat casual, these epics are still more formal than the short prayer songs mentioned earlier. Both men and women recite Ainu epics, though the vocal *qualities* of women are considered preferable to those of men. The epic songs are fairly rhythmic melodic chants. The voice of the singer usually fluctuates within words, and phrases and sentences are distinguished by the melody. Singers strive for their audience to understand every word. The epic is unaccompanied by musical instruments, though at times both the singer and the listener might tap \"repni\", or simple blocks of wood, against the hearth or the floor to help keep time and punctuate the epic. Certain paintings also show these epics being performed lying down, with the singer beating time on his or her abdomen with the hands, but this practice has faded into obscurity.\n\nEpics themselves take several different forms. Following Philippi’s model and dividing them in two different ways, they can be distinguished by both subject and style. Philippi divides epic subjects into two groups: mythic narratives and heroic narratives. Mythic narratives are those epics featuring origin stories and stories of deities, while heroic narratives are those narratives featuring the cultural heroes of the Ainu. Mythic narratives can be told either from the point of view of a human observer or from the point of view of the divine participant. One of the most distinctive aspects of Ainu epics is this first person god point of view. Heroic narratives feature one of several major culture heroes, or recurring protagonists of mythical origins, such as \"Kotan-Kor-Kamui\", or the Owl God. Though these culture heroes are often presented as gods, they are more human than they seem. They are analogous to the Navajo and Apache Coyote; while he is a god, he is representative of human interests and foibles. Stylistically, epics can be divided into two more categories. Some epics are novelistic and feature a set chain of events involving gods and humans, while others, which Philippi refers to as parodies, feature abnormal situations — unexplained phenomena and dreams, presented without a clear chronological narrative. These \"parody\" epics are very rare.\n\nEpics, as well as a few of the more everyday songs, are regularly featured in Ainu ceremonies. For example, the most famous of Ainu cultural events, the \"bear-sending ceremony,\" is accompanied by a whole host of songs, not the least of which is the \"Song of a Bear,\" a mythic epic. This epic relates the story of the bear god, who, in saving his young son, is killed by human hunters. The song both presents the situation from the god’s point of view — he is confused when he is killed, and doesn’t recognize his own dead body for what it is — and prescribes the methods for the bear-sending ceremony. The premise for the bear-sending is that the bear god is trapped in his mortal body, and by killing the bear in a ritualized, respectful manner, humans are doing the god a favor and sending him home. The song describes the \"inau\", or carved sticks that are used as holy objects by the Ainu, as well as the prayers and ceremonies that are used to send the bear home. In this way, the ceremony and the epic are somewhat inseparable. The activities of the ceremony are outlined by the epic, and the epic accompanies the ceremony to reinforce it. Though the epic can be performed outside of the ceremony, it cannot exist without the ceremony as context, and the ceremony cannot be performed without the epic. These epics, as well as the everyday songs, represent the cultural heritage of the Ainu and allow us to understand customs and their mythic significance, but they also act as indicators of the relative well-being of the Ainu culture.\n\nRekukhara, also known as \"rekutkar\" (composed from the Ainu words for throat, rekut, and produce kar), was a vocal game popular amongst Sakhalin Ainu, and used throat singing techniques comparable to katajjaq, the Inuit singing style. A game was typically played by two to ten people at a time, always in pairs.\n\nAt the start of each game, players take opposite places and form with their hands a closed tube between each other’s mouths. One of the players starts by making a certain rhythmical motive which then resonates in the other player’s mouth. This player must then uphold this motive until the other player decides to change motive. Whoever can uphold these rules without losing breath or laughing wins.\n\nAccording to an interview with the daughter of the last practitioner of this style (who died in 1973), the rekukhara was often done during the iomante ritual, the slaughter of a brown bear, as the produced sounds from this game would symbolically refer to the cries of the bear.\n\nYaisama is a form of singing game used as an expression of certain emotions (such as expressing love) or as means of self introduction in a group. As lyrics and melody are improvised on the spot, this genre can be compared to contemporary freestyle rap.\n\nThe name of these Ainu lullabies differ by location: the terms \"Iyon'nokka\" or \"Iyonruika\" were commonly used in the Hidaka region, while Ihunke was the term used by Asahikawa and Tokachi Ainu.\n\nOne of the characteristics of these lullabies, is the mother’s production of meaningless sounds such as \"Ohho Lulu Rurururu\" on the rhythm of lulling baby’s cradle, typically done by rolling the tip of the tongue.\n\nThe two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments are the tonkori and the mukkari. Through the effort of Ainu cultural organizations as well as prominent musicians, both have enjoyed a certain revival. Evidence shows the existence of several other instruments attributed to the Ainu, but these are no longer in active use.\n\nAs a result of the geographical dispersion of the Ainu people over various neighboring islands, some of these native instruments strongly differ in usage and construction.\n\nThe Mukkuri is an idiophone made out of bamboo, similar in construction to the Jaw harp. Sound is produced by manipulating a string connected to the bamboo reed, and while the instrument is unpitched, tone manipulation can be accomplished by altering the size of one’s mouth, which serves as a resonance box during playing.\n\nHistorically this instrument did not retain a large importance in Ainu communities and was commonly seen as a children’s toy rather than a tool for supporting songs or rituals. The mukkuri’s inexpensive production however has made it a popular tourist souvenir in Hokkaido.\n\nThe tonkori, an onomatopoeic description of the sound the instrument produces, is a plucked string instrument and generally has five strings made out of gut. Unfretted and played open, the tonkori is limited in tones by the number of strings. \nThe tonkori is played by both men and women and commonly serves as musical accompaniment to yukar or dances and rituals, although solo-performances have been noted as well.\n\nThe Kaco was a percussion instrument similar to the tambourine, used for accompanying yukar or shamanistic rituals. It was made by stretching animal skin over a cylindrical ring commonly made out of willow or larch, and its drumbeater was done by wrapping dogskin over a branch.\n\nThe cirektekuttar (referred to in Sakhalin as \"henyudo\", \"ionka\" or \"pehkutu\"), was a cylindrical wind instrument made out of the root of a reed indigenous to northern Japan, and is thought to have been similar in style and usage as the didgeridoo developed by Indigenous Australians.\n\nAfter cultural exchange with the Russians, Ainu living on the Kurille islands built this instrument in the image of the Russian balalaika, pronounced in Ainu as pararayki.\n\nMissionary-anthropologist John Batchelor describes the existence of several Ainu-created fiddles no longer in usage.\n\nAinu music has been important throughout the years in both reflecting and establishing the Ainu cultural identity. Ainu music, historically, has represented the state of Ainu society. The folkloric epics of the Ainu often refer directly to the state of the Ainu as a group. For example, when the Ainu were first conquered, in the period of decline after the 16th century, the culture heroes featured in the heroic types of epics were said to have \"departed in indignation,\". In addition to this kind of direct representation of Ainu cultural identity, the variable increase and decline of Ainu music is also indicative of Ainu culture. In the peak Ainu period, the most complex and fantastic epics were created, stretching out to tens of thousands of verses and building on new and complex ideas. In the most desperate period for the Ainu, however, in late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the population declined to only 15,000 or so, Ainu music was very scarce; even the famous bear-sending ceremony was described as a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience in 1948.\n\nThe pressure on Ainu music throughout their history as a people under the rule of a dominant majority has come largely from the Japanese government. The Japanese government deliberately banned Ainu language, music, and dance (including the bear ceremony) in 1799 in an attempt to homogenize the Ainu with the larger Japanese population. In addition to this, through pressure and in governmental institutions such as schools, \"on every possible occasion the Bakufu persuaded the natives to follow the Japanese way,\". This attitude, that the Ainu should do as much as possible to become Japanese, existed in the government well into the 20th century. A railway tourism manual published in 1941 reflects not only this attitude, but also the idea that the Ainu were happy to have their culture suppressed in this way. \"They have a special aversion to distinctive treatment, and have Japanized themselves in every respect. They have abandoned their native customs and manners, forgotten the Ainu tongue and effected a complete change in their daily life.\" It continues, \"They requested of the Government a census whereby they might become recognized Japanese subjects. This the Government instituted and the Ainu were accepted as common people. Consequently, they are now so Japanesque that their characteristics as an Ainu race will vanish before long,\". While these excerpts are indicative of the attitude of the government that the Ainu should conform to the rest of Japanese society, the pamphlet’s very existence counters the idea that they fit in. The pamphlet goes on to detail the very differences that make the Ainu worth writing a tourism pamphlet on, describing their customs and ceremonies and even pointing out their racial differences.\nThis kind of contradiction is actually characteristic of the way the Japanese government has treated the Ainu, especially in the early 20th century. Besides publications such as the aforementioned pamphlet, the government also created cultural shows featuring Ainu song and dance that acted as tourist attractions (this occurred, of course, after the ban on Ainu music had been lifted). Ainu singers and dancers could often only find an avenue for their talents, and in some cases, find any job at all, in these cultural shows. The shows featured sacred, ceremonial songs, especially those of the famous bear-sending. The songs would be repeated three or four times a day, for dozens of tourists. Kayano Shigeru, who some have called \"Ainu personified\", a prominent Ainu public figure, recalls the shows he participated in with shame. \"It is beyond words for me to explain to others how miserable it made us feel to sing and dance — albeit for money — in front of curious tourists from throughout Japan when we weren’t even happy or excited,\". The government was, in effect, encouraging certain aspects of Ainu culture while concurrently suppressing it as a whole. Ceremonial songs and dances became both a viable means of making a living and a shameful badge of dishonor.\n\nIn recent years, Ainu music has begun to take part in an intense Ainu cultural revival. The Ainu began reclaiming their identity as a cultural group in the 1960s and 1970s, meeting with one another, creating organized groups, and even developing an Ainu flag. While most of this reclamation occurred by way of peaceful meetings and beneficial organizations such as Kayano Shigeru’s work for a national Ainu museum, some groups, like Ainu Liberation, used terrorist tactics such as the bombing of October 23, 1972, to attract attention to their cause. As a whole, however, the movement for Ainu cultural identity has been exacted through cultural media such as art, storytelling, and music, and political tactics like voting blocs and nonviolent protests. In the 1970s and 1980s, festival and ceremonial revivals began to occur, acting as a catalyst for cultural unity. When Ainu ceremonies were performed regularly for the first time in years, it allowed Ainu to come together, to identify and get to know one another through the avenue of culture, and to bond through that avenue as well. In addition to the creation of community in this way, and because Ainu song is so firmly rooted in history, Ainu were able to reclaim their folkloric history through these ceremonies.\n\nThe revival of Ainu culture, and especially music, has meant more than just the development of a cohesive group of Ainu people, however. It has, not surprisingly, also resulted in the rise of an Ainu-music pop star on the Japanese stage. Oki Kano, the most prominent player of Ainu-inspired pop music in Japan, plays songs that are based on Ainu ceremonial songs. They use indigenous Ainu instruments, Ainu language, and Ainu subject matter, but also include Western influences such as guitar and bass, and sound similar to British ska music. Oki Kano is fairly well known in Japan, and represents the idea of Ainu music to many Japanese people, even though his music is very Westernized.\n\n\n\n"}

Salting, either with dry salt or brine, was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. It was frequently called \"junk\" or \"salt horse\".\n\nSalt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required.\n\nSalted meat and fish are a staple of the diet in North Africa, Southern China, Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Salted meat was a staple of the mariner's diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic Royal Navy diet consisted of salted beef, salted pork, ship's biscuit, and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter. Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship \"Moshulu\" to consist almost entirely of salted meat. \"Moshulu's\" lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.\n\n"}

{"id": "1120048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1120048", "title": "Scroll", "text": "Scroll\n\nA scroll (from the Old French \"escroe\" or \"escroue\"), also known as a roll, is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper containing writing.\n\nA scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of writing material. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction (boustrophedon).\n\nSome scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: Torah scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.\n\nScrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations. Parchment scrolls were used by the Israelites among others before the codex or bound book with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD. Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.\n\nThe ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.\n\nShorter pieces of parchment or paper are called \"rolls\" or \"rotuli\", although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use \"roll\" instead of \"scroll\". Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60 cm or two feet wide. Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.\n\nA special Chinese form of short book, called the \"whirlwind book,\" consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.\n\nIn Scotland, the term \"scrow\" was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (\"Rotulorum Clericus\") meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.\n\nThe Romans invented the \"codex\" form of the book, folding the scroll into pages which made reading and handling the document much easier. Legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. \n\nEventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or \"leaves,\" and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. \"Codex\" is Latin for a \"block of wood\": the Latin \"liber\", the root of \"library,\" and the German \"Buch\", the source of \"book,\" both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection.\n\nThe term \"codex\" technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.\n\nFrom the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.\n\nThe oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy’s University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. \n\nThe scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. \n\nModern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged Herculaneum scrolls, researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1120500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1120500", "title": "Sauerbraten", "text": "Sauerbraten\n\nSauerbraten (German: \"sour roast\" from \"sauer\" for \"sour\" or \"pickled\" and \"Braten\" for \"roast meat\") is a German pot roast that can be prepared with a variety of meats—most often beef, but also from venison, lamb, mutton, pork, and traditionally, horse. Before cooking, the cut of meat is marinated for several days (recipes vary from three to ten days) in a mixture of vinegar or wine, water, herbs, spices, and seasonings. Since usually tougher cuts of meat (like rump roast, or bottom round of beef) are used for Sauerbraten, the longer marinating of the meat acts to tenderize it, resulting in a finished dish that is tender, soft, and juicy. The ingredients of the marinade vary based on regional styles and traditions throughout Germany.\n\nSauerbraten is regarded as one of the national dishes of Germany. It is one of the best-known German dishes, and is frequently found on the menus of German-style restaurants outside Germany. Several regional variations on the dish include those from Franconia, Thuringia, Rhineland, Saarland, Silesia, and Swabia. In a few parts of Germany potato pancakes (either \"Kartoffelpuffer\" or \"Reibekuchen\") are served with sauerbraten; many German-style restaurants in the US do this.\n\nSauerbraten is traditionally served with traditional German side dishes, such as Rotkohl (red cabbage), Knödel or Kartoffelklöße (potato dumplings), Spätzle (an egg and flour noodle), and boiled potatoes.\n\nJulius Caesar has been assigned a role in the inspiration for sauerbraten as he sent amphoras filled with beef marinated in wine over the Alps to the newly founded Roman colony of Cologne. According to this legend (Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BC and the Roman city of Cologne was founded in 50 AD), this inspired the residents of Cologne to imitate the Roman import. While quite common, these claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nSeveral sources believe sauerbraten was invented by Charlemagne in the 9th century AD as a means of using leftover roasted meat. Saint Albertus Magnus, also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, is also credited with popularizing the dish in the 13th century.\n\nSauerbraten was originally made from horse meat; this is still done by many traditional restaurants, particularly in the Rhineland, but today, sauerbraten is most often made from beef.\n\nThere are many regional variants of sauerbraten. Many of the variations are in the ingredients used for the marinade in which the cut of meat is immersed for several days before cooking.\n\nGenerally, the marinade's base is either red wine, vinegar or a combination of both. While Germany largely produces white wines such as Riesling and Gewürztraminer, regions of Germany that are closer to France often use red wine as the base for the marinade. Wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar and other varieties can be used as a base. Recipes from eastern regions of Germany closer to Poland and the Czech Republic tend to use vinegar as the base more frequently. In many regions, wine and vinegar are used together.\n\n\nSauerbraten can be made with many different kinds of roasting meat. Tougher, less expensive cuts of meat are used—typically a rump roast or bottom round of beef.\n\nVenison or other game are often prepared as sauerbraten as the spices and vinegar take away the gamey taste of the meat.\n\nA solid cut from the bottom round or rump is marinated for three or four days, or as many as 10, before cooking.\n\nRed wine vinegar and wine typically form the basis of the marinade, which also includes earthy aromatic spices such as peppercorns, juniper berries, cloves, nutmeg, and bay leaves and less commonly coriander, mustard seed, cinnamon, mace, ginger, and thyme. The marinade may also include vegetables such as onions, celery, and carrots. The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat (which is typically a tougher cut) before it cooks. Buttermilk is also used as a marinade in certain regional varieties.\n\nIt is frequently advised to marinate the meat in an earthenware, glass, plastic, or enamel container rather than one made of bare metal, as the acidic marinade would react with a metal vessel during the extended marinating.\n\nAfter the meat is removed from the marinade and dried, it is first browned in oil or lard and then braised with the strained marinade in a covered dish in a medium oven or on the stovetop. After simmering for four hours or more, depending on the size of the roast, the marinade will continue to flavor the roast and, as the meat cooks, its juices will also be released resulting in a very tender roast.\n\nAfter the roast is cooked, the marinade is strained and returned to a saucepan where it is thickened (often with crushed gingerbread, lebkuchen, or gingersnaps, flour, sour cream, brown sugar, and/or roux) which add body and flavor to the sauce. Before it closed in 1982, Luchow's German restaurant in New York City used crushed gingersnap cookies to season and thicken the gravy of its sauerbraten, one of the favored dishes. This style was made popular in the U.S. after the publication of “Luchow's German Cookbook: The Story and the Favorite Dishes of America's Most Famous German Restaurant” by Jan Mitchell in 1952.\n\nPackaged sauerbraten seasonings are available. Cooked sauerbraten in marinade is sold in some supermarkets.\n\nWhile sauerbraten is most traditionally eaten with beer, it pairs well with the following wine varietals: Burgundy, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gewürztraminer, Pinot noir, Riesling, and Syrah.\n\n"}

{"id": "1122115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122115", "title": "Politeia", "text": "Politeia\n\nPoliteia (πολιτεία) is an ancient Greek word used in Greek political thought, especially that of Plato and Aristotle. Derived from the word \"polis\" (\"city-state\"), it has a range of meanings, from \"the rights of citizens\" to a \"form of government\".\n\nAccording to Liddell and Scott's \"Greek-English Lexicon\" a meaning of politeia is \"the conditions and rights of the citizen, or \"citizenship\"\", analogous to the Latin \"civitas\".\n\n\"Politeia\", in Greek means the community of citizens in a city / state. It should not be confused with \"regime\" that is meant by \"politeuma\" or \"Status quo\" that is meant by \"kathestos\".\nThe regime is the word describing the political situation of the community of citizens\nin a city/state, and \"kathestos\" means also the general situation of an object, an agreement,\nor something else.\n\n\"Politeia\" is derived from both the root word \"polis\" meaning city/state, and from the verb \"politeuomai\" that means “I am living as an active citizen of the \"polis\".”\n\nPeople living in a Greek city/state were not necessarily citizens. A person that was ostracized from the active matrix of the \ncity was an example of such. Another example was people who lived in the city but were not \nactive citizens who had a say in the political processes of the community. Women, slaves and \nothers who were deemed unworthy for some reason were not in the active matrix of the \npolitical formations of that city state, making them not-citizens, so not part of \"politeia\".\n\nIn the works of ancient Greek philosophers, the principal meaning of \"politeia\" appears to be: \"how a \"polis\" is run; constitution\". A \"politeia\" differs from modern written constitutions in two respects: first, not all Greek states put their laws in writing; more importantly, the Greeks did not normally distinguish between ordinary and constitutional legislation. If a certain body had the power to change the laws, it had the power to change the laws controlling its own power and membership - even to abolish itself and set up a new governing body.\n\nThe phrases \"system of government\", \"state organisation\", \"form of government\", and, more recently, \"régime\" have also been used to translate \"politeia\". \"Régime\" has drawbacks: it is ambiguous where \"politeia\" is not, since a change of \"régime\" can mean a change of governors under the same form of government. It has a negative tone in English, which \"politeia\" does not in Greek. It is also a loan-word; and in that regard, has no advantage over simply adopting \"politeia\" itself.\n\nSome translators thus use a different term for this second meaning of \"politeia\". Most common is the vague term polity. Specific translations of this second meaning as \"constitutional democracy\" or \"republic\" are at least anachronistic, and in most instances contentious and/or inaccurate. Some translators feel it is incorrect to translate the same word in different ways, arguing that the ambiguity must have been deliberate and that it is impossible to always know which way the word should be rendered.\n\nIn the Greek New Testament \"politeia\" is translated as \"commonwealth\" or \"freedom\" in Ephesians 2:12 and Acts 22:28.\n\n\"Politeia\" is the original title of the book by Plato now commonly known in English as \"The Republic\". Cicero translated \"politeia\" as \"res publica\" (see also: \"De re publica\"), from which the modern word republic comes. Note that the meanings the ancient Romans attached to \"res publica\" were also multiple and only partially overlapping with the Greek \"politeia\", and further that few of the multiple meanings of \"politeia\" or \"res publica\" are much of an equivalent to \"republic\" as it is understood in modern political science.\n\nIn the \"Constitution of the Athenians\" (\"Athenaion Politeia\"), Aristotle uses \"politeia\" for eleven states of the Athenian government up to his own time, from the absolute monarchy of Ionia and the tyranny of the Thirty to the democratic Assembly and selection by lot of Pericles's time and his own. He may have added that the absolute monarchy of Ion was \"less political\" than that of Theseus or the later constitutions, but the text is doubtful.\n\nIn his \"Politics\", Aristotle clearly uses \"politeia\" both as above and also in a more restricted sense. Exactly what this sense is, and whether Aristotle is using it in a consistent manner, have both been long debated. By careful choice of quotation, all of the following can be defended: \nIn Book III of his \"Politics\" (1279a), Aristotle seems to indicate that, in principle, \"politeia\" refers generically to any form of government or constitution, although he uses the word also to call a particular form of government: “\"When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments\" (politeion)\", government\" (politeia)”.\n\nWhy Aristotle uses the same term to refer to at least two distinct ideas has confused readers for millennia. For instance, later Aristotle refers to the ideal politeia as one using a mixed government. But it is uncertain whether he is referring to governments in general or to a specific form.\n\nIn the New Testament \"politeia\" refers both the Greek World as well as to the nation of Israel. Strong's Concordance defines the term as:\nSignifies (a) \"the relation in which a citizen stands to the state, the condition of a citizen, citizenship,\" Acts 22:28, \"with a great sum obtained I this citizenship\" (KJV, \"freedom\"). While Paul's \"citizenship\" of Tarsus was not of advantagre outside that city, yet his Roman \"citizenship\" availed throughout the Roman Empire and, besides private rights, included (1) exemption from all degrading punishments; (2) a right of appeal to the emperor after a sentence; (3) a right to be sent to Rome for trial before the emperor if charged with a capital offense. Paul's father might have obtained \"citizenship\" (1) by manumission; (2) as a reward of merit; (3) by purchase; the contrast implied in Acts 22:28 is perhaps against the last mentioned; (b) \"a civil polity, the condition of a state, a commonwealth,\" said of Israel, Ephesians 2:12.\n\n\n"}

A spiedie consists of cubes of chicken, pork, lamb, veal, venison or beef. The meat cubes are marinated overnight or longer, then grilled on spits over a charcoal pit.\n\nThe traditional method involves serving freshly prepared cubes of lamb, chicken, or beef on soft Italian bread or a submarine roll, occasionally drizzled with fresh marinade. Spiedie meat cubes can also be eaten straight off the skewer or can be served in salads, stir fries, and a number of other dishes. The marinade recipe varies, usually involving olive oil, vinegar, and a variety of Italian spices and fresh mint.\n\nSpiedies have been celebrated at the Spiedie Fest and Balloon Rally in Binghamton, New York every August since 1983. The annual event includes a spiedie cook-off in search of the best spiedie recipes.\n\nThe term \"spiedie\" is derived from the Italian \"spiedo\" meaning spit. The regional dish called \"spiedini\" or \"spidducci\" in Abruzzo, Italy, most closely resembling spiedie, uses cubes or balls of goat meat, lamb, chicken or beef on a skewer.\n\nThe original idea for the spiedie was brought by Italian immigrants to upstate New York in the early 1920s. The specific origin of the spiedie is disputed. Traditionally, the early Broome County spiedie was made only from spring lamb, but currently most commercial restaurants prepare spiedies using chicken or pork. The \"chicken category\" was added to the Spiedie Fest cook-off in 1987, and quickly became the most popular meat choice.\n\nCamillo Iacovelli created the spiedie in Endwell, New York, and was serving them in 1938 at his Parkview Restaurant on Oak Hill Ave in Endicott. His brother, Agostino \"Augie\" Iacovelli, popularized spiedies when he introduced them in his Endicott restaurant Augie's in 1939. Iacovelli's marinade, which he called \"zuzu\", originally was made simply from wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, garlic and mint. Italian spices, olive oil and minced onion were added later as regional tastes and the choice of meat began to vary. Augie Iacovelli's son Guido continued in the spiedie business into the 1990s, owning as many as 26 restaurants at the peak of his career.\n\nPeter Sharak is also alleged to have invented spiedies, and began serving them in 1947 at his Sharky's Bar and Grill in Binghamton. Sharkey's promotes itself as the birthplace of the sandwich in television commercials across the greater Binghamton area.\n\nIn 1975, Rob Salamida became the first person to bottle the sauce and sell it. He began by cooking spiedies outside a local tavern at 16. After writing letters for over a year, he was allowed to have his own booth at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, New York. For 12 years he built his reputation at the fair. After a tornado nearly struck his stand in 1975, he decided it would be more lucrative and safer to bottle a spiedie marinade.\n\nIn 1983, a few families got together and held a Spiedie Fest that was a tremendous hit. Coupled with a Balloon Rally, it quickly grew to an annual festival attracting more than 100,000 attendees (and also one of the top balloon rallies in the country).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1124901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1124901", "title": "Tianxia", "text": "Tianxia\n\nTianxia () is a Chinese term for an ancient Chinese cultural concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In ancient China, \"tianxia\" denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, tributary states, and finally ending with the fringe \"barbarians\". \n\nThe center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese \"tianxia\". In classical Chinese political thought, the \"Son of Heaven\" (Emperor of China) (), having received the Mandate of Heaven (), would nominally be the ruler of the entire world. Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Emperor, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Emperor.\n\nThe larger concept of \"tianxia\" is closely associated with civilization and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the world view of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. \"Tianxia\" has been independently applied by other countries in the East Asian cultural sphere, including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\nThe \"tianxia\" world view was not fully developed during the Shang dynasty. Only during the Zhou dynasty when Heaven took on human deity traits (or at least when references to Heaven as such enter recorded history) did the concept of \"tianxia\" become common. Terms like \"Four Quarters\" and \"Ten Thousand States\" appear in texts of the time; the term \"Four Quarters\" () means territory established by the royal court and governed by the Zhou kings from the capital, but with peripheral non-Han tribes on the outer borders and Han Chinese in the center. The term \"Ten Thousand States\" () refers to both territory and the subjects who reside therein, both Han and \"barbarian\". The Zhou kings received and empowered these \"Ten Thousand States\" by virtue of the Mandate of Heaven. This is some of the earliest evidence of the Hua-Yi distinction.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of the feudal lords developed rapidly, and several non-Han regions became powerful states themselves. As many of these feudal states had shared cultural and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the Yellow River Plain gradually expanded. The term \"tianxia\" began to appear in classical texts such as the \"Zuo Zhuan\" and \"Guoyu\".\n\nThe territory and governments of the Zhou dynasty and the Qin dynasty were unified after the conquests of Qin Shi Huang, and the concept of \"tianxia\" was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity. Qin Shi Huang's goal to \"unify all under Heaven\" was, in fact, representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the Han dynasty, the equivalence of \"tianxia\" with the Chinese nation evolved due to the feudal practice of conferring land and autonomy upon the aristocracy to avoid having to expend military expense in their subjugation. Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory.\n\nUnification theme applied to \"tianxia\" can be seen in Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer:\n\nUnified China fractured into many different nations during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and with it went the practical use of the term \"tianxia\". When Emperor Gaozu reunited China under the Tang dynasty in the 7th century, some northern tribes, after being made vassal, referred to him as the \"Khan of Heaven\".\n\nBy the time of the Song dynasty, China's northern borders were met by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, and the Tangut-led Western Xia kingdom. After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations. The Mongols divided Chinese citizens into two types during the Yuan dynasty: those of the south, and those of the north. When the Ming dynasty expelled the Mongols and reunited China under Han rule, the concept of \"tianxia\" returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty.\n\nAt the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of Neo-Confucianism and its mantras of \"cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing \"tianxia\"\" (a quote from the Great Learning) became widespread, producing large shifts in Confucianism. Contemporary philosopher Wang Fuzhi believed that tianxia was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning's mentioning of \"harmonizing \"tianxia\"\" was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism. On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the Qing dynasty by the Manchus, people previously considered \"fringe barbarians\", heavily influenced people's views of \"tianxia\". Gu Yanwu, a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of \"tianxia\". He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the \"tianxia\" of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on.\n\nThe idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of \"tianxia\" by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with Earl Macartney's embassy to China in 1793. Earl Macartney hoped to deal with China as equal sovereign nations, as Great Britain would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to sign a trade agreement. The Qianlong Emperor rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods, and rejected the idea that Great Britain could negotiate with China as an equal nation. In the early 19th century, Britain's victory over Qing China in the First Opium War forced China to sign an unequal treaty. This marked the beginning of the end for the \"tianxia\" concept.\n\nFollowing their defeat in the Second Opium War, China was forced to sign the Treaty of Tianjin, in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a \"sovereign nation\", equal to itself. This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional \"tianxia\" system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau.\n\nBecause Western nations' system of international affairs was based on the idea that the sovereign nations dealt with each other as equals, China's traditional \"tianxia\" world view slowly collapsed. After China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese terminated Korea's traditional status as a protectorate of China, and the system of feudal enfeoffment and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the \"tianxia\" concept. At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Great Britain Xue Fucheng took the traditional Hua-Yi distinction in the \"tianxia\" world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction.\n\nReferences to \"tianxia\" first appear in Japanese history during the Kofun period, approximately 250 to 538 AD. At the time, Japanese rulers were respectful and submissive to the Chinese court, and Chinese immigrants (then called \"toraijin\" 渡來人) were received happily and sought after for their knowledge of the Chinese language and culture. The excavated Eda Funayama grave mound in Kumamoto contained an iron sword with engraved characters that dates to the late 5th century. The characters on the sword refer to the king of the time as the \"Grand King who rules all under \"Tianxia\"\" (). This discovery demonstrates that the Kofun-era Japanese (at least of that area) had begun viewing their realm to be a complete and divinely-appointed \"tianxia\" in its own right, separate from the \"tianxia\" of the older and larger Chinese empire.\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Sui\", the Yamato king in 607 sent a hand-written epistle to Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty in which he called himself the \"Son of Heaven in the Land of the Rising Sun\" (), showing that the Japanese notion of their independent \"tianxia\" had continued to that time.\n\nWith the development of \"Ritsuryō\" in 7th-century Japan, a Sino-centric concept of \"tianxia\" was introduced and replaced older concepts. The hallmark of \"Ritsuryō\" – the concept of citizenship – necessarily accompanied its introduction into Japan, since Neo-Confucianism said that all were \"Equal Citizens Under Heaven\" ().\n\nIn the journals of Fujiwara no Kanezane (藤原兼実、九條兼実), an official of the Kamakura shogunate whose journals became the \"Gyokuyō\" (玉葉), he describes the founding of the Shogunate by Minamoto no Yoritomo as \"beginning \"tianxia\"\". His usage of \"tianxia\" is entirely \"Ritsuryō\" in nature, and his phrase \"beginning \"tianxia\"\" refers to the establishment of a new nation, jurisprudence, and system of order. However, even if Yoritomo had the intention to become a monarch-level ruler, Japan's \"tianxia\" concept had not achieved the Chinese level of an Emperor who governed feudal kingdoms and was entrusted with the ordering of the world by Heaven. In the journals of Gidō Shūshin (義堂周信), Gidō records a discussion he had with Ashikaga Yoshimitsu where the Shōgun repeatedly referred to his dominion as \"\"tianxia\"\". In the Muromachi period, people gradually began regarding the Shōgun as the representative of Heaven.\n\nAs the Muromachi shogunate weakened, regional warlords began fighting with each other for control of the nation. More powerful nobles, such as Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, controlled large areas and viewed their domains as \"tianxia\". The term was used with increasing frequency as generals sought to reunify Japan, and came to be equivalent with the land of Japan itself.\n\nBy the Edo period, the \"shōgun\" was referred to as \"Man of \"Tianxia\"\" and the Shogunate as \"Court of \"Tianxia\"\". The widespread adoption of the \"tianxia\" concept helped influence Japan's long period of isolation before the Meiji Restoration.\n\nBased on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, Goguryeo had concepts of Son of Heaven (天帝之子) and independent \"tianxia\". The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the \"Haedong\" \"East of the Sea\" \"tianxia\", which encompassed the historical domain of the \"\"Samhan\"\", another name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea.\n\nIn the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or the \"Little China\" (), emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.\n\nThe \"all under the heaven\" expression became the origin for the literary expressions denoting China in a number of Western languages, such as the Russian \"Podnebesnaya\" (Поднебесная, i.e. \"Under the heaven\"). The English term \"Celestial Empire\" is said to have been based on the title of Chinese emperors, \"tian zi\" (Son of Heaven).\n\n\n"}

It was not until the 470s that the Greeks began to refer to \"Persians\", with Aeschylus' play \"The Persians\" in 472 being an early example of this.\n\nMedism was considered a faux pas, even a crime, in many ancient Greek city-states. However, it does not seem to have been specifically criminalised. For instance, in Athens suspected Medisers were charged with treason. The evidence suggests that this was true of other Greek city-states too: in Teos, for instance, a law from the classical period provided that anyone who betrayed the city should be punished by death, but failed to distinguish betrayal to the Persians from betrayal to any other group.\n\nThemistocles the Athenian was ostracized for medism. Pausanias, the Lacedaemonian \"hegemon\" of the Hellenic League in the Battle of Plataea, was accused of medism by other member states, an accusation which allowed Athens to seize control of the league. Herodotus mentions the so-called \"state medism\" of Aegina, Thessaly, Argos, Thebes, and other Boeotians. Astute politicians in Athens often exploited popular feelings against medism as a means to their own advancement, which once led to a feud between the poets Timocreon of Rhodes and Simonides of Ceos in support of and against Themistocles, respectively.\n\n"}

These are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest. Although toffee apples and caramel apples may seem similar, they are made using distinctly different processes.\n\nAccording to one source, American William W. Kolb invented the red candy apple.\n\nKolb, a veteran Newark candy-maker, produced his first batch of candied apples in 1908. While experimenting in his candy shop with red cinnamon candy for the Christmas trade, he dipped some apples into the mixture and put them in the windows for display. He sold the whole first batch for 5 cents each and later sold thousands yearly. Soon candied apples were being sold along the Jersey Shore, at the circus and in candy shops across the country, according to the \"Newark News\" in 1948.\n\nToffee apples are made by coating an apple with a layer of sugar that has been heated to hard crack stage (depending upon the type of sugar). The most common sugar coating is made from sugar (white or brown), corn syrup, water, cinnamon and red food coloring. Humid weather can prevent the sugar from hardening.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, news reports about children supposedly receiving candy apples with pins and razor blades in them, created concern during Halloween in the United States. Hospitals offered free x-rays to detect foreign objects in the candy apples. To date, the stories have never been substantiated and fall into the category of urban legend.\n"}
{"id": "1130003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130003", "title": "Artos", "text": "Artos\n\nAn artos (, \"leavened loaf\", \"bread\") is a loaf of leavened bread that is blessed during services in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine rite catholic churches. A large Artos is baked with a seal depicting the resurrection for use at Pascha (Easter). Smaller loaves are blessed during great vespers in a ritual called Artoklasia and in other occasions like feast days, weddings, memorial services etc.\n\nArtos in Ancient Greek meant \"cake\", \"loaf of wheat-bread\", collectively \"bread\", but in Modern Greek it is now more commonly used in the context of communion bread used in church, having been replaced in the broader context by the word , \"psomi\". This word is thought to be first attested in Mycenaean Greek as the first stem of the compound word , \"a-to-po-qo\", \"bakers\", written in the Linear b syllabary.\n\nNear the end of the Paschal Vigil, after the Prayer Before the Ambo, a single large loaf of bread, the Artos, is brought to the priest. Depicted on the top of the Artos are either the symbol of Christ's victory over death—the Cross, surmounted by a crown of thorns—or the Resurrection of Christ. The Artos symbolizes the physical presence of the resurrected Christ among the disciples.\nThe priest blesses the Artos with a special prayer and sprinkles it with Holy Water. The Artos is then placed on a small table before the Iconostasis where it remains throughout Bright Week. It is customary, whenever the faithful enter the Temple, for them to kiss the Artos as a way of greeting the Risen Christ. On every day of Bright Week, after the Paschal Divine Liturgy (or, alternatively, after Paschal Matins), the Artos is carried in a solemn procession around the outside of the church.\n\nIn monasteries, the Artos is carried to the Trapeza every day of Bright Week, where at the end of the festive meal, it is lifted in a ceremony called the Lifting of the Artos. The one performing the ceremony will lift up the Artos (symbolizing Christ's Resurrection) and say, \"Christ is Risen!\" All will respond, \"He is truly Risen!\" The celebrant will then make the sign of the Cross with the Artos as he says, \"We worship His Resurrection on the third day!\" Then two Paschal hymns are sung and everyone comes forward to kiss the Artos and receive the Superior's blessing, as all sing the Paschal troparion many times.\n\nOn Bright Saturday, after the Divine Liturgy, the priest says another prayer over the Artos and it is then broken and distributed among the whole congregation along with the Antidoron.\n\nThe significance of the artos is that it serves to remind all Christians of the events connected with the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ. While still living on earth, the Lord called Himself the Bread of Life, saying: \"I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and He who believes in Me shall never thirst\" (). After His Resurrection, more than once Jesus appeared to His disciples, ate before them and blessed their own food. For example, as evening fell on the first day of His Resurrection, He was recognized in Emmaus by two of His disciples as He blessed and broke bread ().\n\nOn the 40th day after His Resurrection, the Lord ascended into heaven, and His disciples and followers found comfort in their memories of the Lord: they recalled His every word, His every step and His every action. When they met for common prayer, they would partake of the Body and Blood of Christ, remembering the Last Supper. When they sat down to an ordinary meal, they would leave a place at the head of the table empty for the invisibly present Lord and would lay bread on that place.\n\nRemembering this custom of the Apostles, the Fathers of the Church made it their custom to put out the Artos at the Paschal Feast in memory of the appearances of the Risen Lord to His disciples, and also in memory of the fact that the Lord Who suffered and was resurrected for our justification has made Himself the true Bread of Life and is invisibly present in His church always, to the close of the age ().\n\nWhereas special Paschal breads, called \"kulichi\" are broken and eaten on the first day of Pascha, the Artos is kept whole throughout the whole of Bright Week as a reminder of the presence of the Risen Savior in the midst of those who believe in Him and is only divided and distributed on Saturday. In this way Bright Week begins and ends with the eating of especially baked and blessed bread.\n\nThe Artos may also be compared to the unleavened bread of the Old Testament, of which ancient Israel, delivered from their captivity in the land of Egypt, ate during the week of the Passover (Ex. 12:15-20). As Cyril, Bishop of Turov, who lived during the 12th Century in Russia, said in a sermon for the Sunday after Pascha:\n\nEven as the Jews bore the unleavened bread upon their heads out of Egypt through the desert () until they had crossed the Red Sea, after which they dedicated the bread to God, divided it amongst all their host, and having all eaten thereof, became...terrible to their enemies, even so do we, saved by our Resurrected Lord from the captivity of that Pharaoh of the mind, the Devil, bear forth the blessed bread the Artos from the day of the Resurrection of Christ and, finally, having dedicated this bread to God, we eat of it and preserve it to the health of body and soul.\n\nIt is a custom among Russian Orthodox Christians to this day to keep a portion of the artos throughout the year and with due reverence and faith to eat of it in time of illness or distress. This is eaten, often together with a drink of Holy Water, which had been blessed at the Feast of the Theophany of Our Lord.\n\nOn feast days towards the end of vespers there is a blessing of loaves, wheat, wine, and oil, whereafter the priest breaks one of the loaves from which action the rite receives its name: \"Artoklasia\", \"breaking of bread\".\n\nThe loaves for the Artoklasia may be sealed (before baking) with a stamp (as are the Prosphora for the Divine Liturgy); such a seal may have an Icon of a saint on it, or it may be a simple cross—perhaps inscribed with a prayer on it, such as \"May the Blessing of the Lord be upon us. Amen.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1130380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130380", "title": "Gimbap", "text": "Gimbap\n\nGimbap () is a Korean dish made from cooked rice and other ingredients that are rolled in \"gim\"—dried sheets of nori seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices. The dish is often part of a packed meal, or \"dosirak\", to be eaten at picnics and outdoor events, and can serve as a light lunch along with \"danmuji\" (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi. It is a popular take-out food in Korea and abroad, and is known as a convenient food because of its portability. It is usually well wrapped (traditionally with aluminium-foil, but now sometimes in paper) and does not have any liquid ingredients.\n\n\"Gim\" () refers to edible seaweed in the genus \"Porphyra\" and \"Pyropia\". \"Bap\" () broadly refers to \"cooked rice\". The compound term \"gimbap\" was not a part of the Korean language until the modern era. A food with a similar concept, cooked rice wrapped in \"gim,\" was called \"bokssam\" () in the Joseon era (1392–1897).\n\nThe term \"gimbap\" was used in a 1935 Korean newspaper article, but at the time, the loanword \"norimaki\" was used as well. \"Norimaki\", which borrowed from the name of a similar Japanese dish, was part of the Japanese vocabulary that entered into the Korean language during the Japanese forced occupation (1910–1945), when teaching and speaking Korean were prohibited. The two words were used interchangeably until \"gimbap\" was made the universal term as part of efforts to clear away the remnants of Japanese colonialism and purify the Korean language.\n\nProduction of \"gim\" in Gyeongsang and Jeolla Provinces is reported in books from the 15th century, such as \"Gyeongsang-do Jiriji\" and \"Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam\". Eating cooked rice rolled in \"gim\" is also a long-standing Korean custom. \"Yeoryang Sesigi\", a Joseon book from 1819, describes a dish called \"bokssam\" (; transcribed using the hanja , pronounced \"bakjeom\" in Korean).\n\nThere are two conflicting versions of the origin of the modern form of gimbap. Some sources say it was derived from \"norimaki\", a Japanese sushi variant introduced to Korea during the Japanese forced occupation. Other sources say the food was developed from the local tradition of rolling \"bap\" (cooked rice) and \"banchan\" (side dishes) in \"gim\".\n\n\"Gimbap\" and \"norimaki\" now refer to distinct dishes in Japan and Korea: the former called \"kimupapu\" () in Japanese and the latter called \"gimchobap\" (; \"gim sushi\") or \"norimaki\" () in Korean. Gimbap usually contains more ingredients and is seasoned with sesame oil, while \"norimaki\" is rolled with fewer ingredients and is seasoned with rice vinegar.\n\n\"Gim\" and \"bap\" are the two basic components of gimbap. While short-grain white rice is most commonly used, short-grain brown rice, black rice, or other grains may also serve as the filling.\n\nSome varieties of gimbap include cheese, spicy cooked squid, kimchi, luncheon meat, or spicy tuna. The \"gim\" may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In one variation, sliced pieces of gimbap may be lightly fried with an egg coating.\n\nFillings vary, often with vegetarian and vegan options. Popular ingredients include \"danmuji\" (yellow pickled radish), ham, beef, imitation crab meat, egg strips, kimchi, bulgogi, spinach, carrot, burdock root, cucumber, canned tuna, and \"kkaennip\" (perilla leaves).\n\nTo make the dish, \"gim\" sheets are toasted over a low heat, cooked rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil, and vegetable and meat ingredients are seasoned and stir-fried or pan-fried. The toasted \"gim\" is then laid on a \"gimbal—\"a bamboo gimbap roller—with a thin layer of cooked rice placed evenly on top. Other ingredients are placed on the rice and rolled into a cylindrical shape, typically in diameter. The rolled gimbap is then sliced into bite-sized pieces.\n\n\nMany South Korean fast food restaurant franchises specialize in gimbap and noodles. Among the chains are Gimbap Cheonguk (), Kobongmin Gimbabin (), Chungmu Gimbab Matjuk (), Teacher Kim (), Gimbap Nar (), Gimgane (), Gobong Gimbap (), Jongro Gimbap (), Rolling Rice, Gimbap King ( King), and Charles Sutbul Gimbap (). Some of these restaurants also serve other dishes, including \"dongaseu\" (pork cutlet), \"ramyeon\" (instant noodles), \"udong\" (thick noodle soup), \"naengmyeon\" (cold noodles), bibimbap, and stews such as \"kimchi-jjigae\" (kimchi stew), \"doenjang-jjigae\" (soybean paste stew), \"sundubu-jjigae\" (soft tofu stew), and omurice.\n\nGimbap is generally sold in restaurants, where they are pre-cut. However, due to the negative stigma surrounding begging, unskilled public busking and prostitution, selling whole gimbap as a street vendor is seen as the final noble and dignified form of busking that an otherwise able person, or family members of affected people, can do to get out of poverty. This is because virtually everybody can make this, and it is much more cost and time effective, and less labour-intensive, than making kimchi or preserved fruits. Vendors often sell and eat gimbap as an entire log, even after they are out of poverty or emergency. Selling whole also extends shelf life, and signifies longevity. \n"}

Sometimes known as \"duck soup\", hen, rabbit or pig blood can also be used. In English it can be called \"duck blood soup\".\n\nGenerally the sweet and sour taste of the soup comes from the balance of sugar and vinegar. However, there are hundreds of recipes popular in different parts of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. Among the ingredients used are plum or pear syrup, dried pears, plums or cherries, apple vinegar and honey. Like most Polish soups, czernina is usually served with kluski, fine noodles, macaroni, boiled potatoes, or dumplings.\n\nUntil the 19th century czernina was also a symbol in Polish culture. It was served to young men applying for the hand of their beloved. If the suitor was accepted he would be served black czernina along with the rest of the family. If not, he would be served a bowl of golden czernina, made without the duck's blood, as a symbolic rejection of their proposal. It is a plot element in \"Pan Tadeusz\", a famous Polish epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz.\n\nIt is also a regional dish in Kashubia, Masuria and Poznań.\n\nCzernina is very similar to Swedish svartsoppa.\n\n"}

In the Malay language, barang means \"thing\".\n\nThe origin of this word is debatable as there are several possibilities. One is that it came from Arabic (faranj) via Malay traders. Another is that it came straight from the French. Since Khmer does not have a letter that represents the Latin F, it is pronounced with a B sound. As with many Khmer words of foreign origin, \"n\"'s often change to an \"ng\" sound.

{"id": "1132820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1132820", "title": "Cat food", "text": "Cat food\n\nCat food is food for consumption by cats. Cats have specific requirements for their dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found in meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards. Long-term taurine deficiency may result in retinal degeneration, loss of vision, and cardiac arrest.\nContrary to popular belief, most cats dislike insects and probably eat them mistakenly which results in a bad stomach followed by vomiting.\n\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see dog biscuits and dog food). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\nIn 1844, another French writer expanded on this idea:\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for Spratt (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\" And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently horse meat, was sold from barrows (hand–carts) by itinerant traders known as \"Cats' Meat Men\".\n\nCats are obligate carnivores—meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an emetic.\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids taurine and arginine, so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as \"kibble\", or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who feed raw.\n\nDry food (8–10% moisture) is generally made by extrusion cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase palatability, and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall paper bags, sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\nIn the United States, canned or wet food (75–78% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 oz (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes. It is also sold in foil pouch form.\n\nEven though cats are obligate carnivores, there are vegetarian and vegan cat foods available. Vegetarian cat food must be fortified with nutrients such as taurine and arachidonic acid that cats cannot synthesize from plant materials. Some vegetarian cat food brands in the USA are labeled by their manufacturers as meeting AAFCO's Cat Food Nutrient Profile.\n\nLow protein diets are not as popular with consumers than high protein diets. Low protein diets are frequently associated with renal care formulas and other prescribed therapeutic diets.\n\nRaw feeding is providing uncooked ingredients to cats. Most of the diet will consist of animal-based ingredients, though fruits, vegetables and supplements are often added. Commercial raw food is mainly sold in three formats: fresh, frozen and freeze-dried. Thawing and rehydration are necessary before feeding frozen and freeze-dried food respectively. Many available commercial diets are AAFCO certified in meeting the nutrient requirements of the cat. Some diets may be formulated for all life stages or they can also be AAFCO certified for adult maintenance or growth and gestation/lactation. Many people feed their cats raw food believing that it mimics the prey diet that wild cats would consume. Firm believers in raw diets report that they bring health benefits such as a shiny coat, cleaner teeth, improved immunity, energy and body odors to their cats, although no scientific evidence exists to prove these claims.\n\nCommercial raw diets can undergo High Pressure Pasteurization (HPP), a process which kills bacteria and pathogens, including salmonella, using high water pressure. This technique is USDA approved and allows raw food to remain uncooked while greatly improving its safety and shelf-life. However, every year, many commercial raw pet foods are recalled due to various bacterial contamination, implying that feeding raw comes with a risk.\n\nWeight control simply means ensuring an energy balance: energy in equals energy out. Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. But the cat needs to take enough exercise too.\n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that has been formulated for maintenance, while at the same time it should be fed according to preference and body condition. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which tends to lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight, with no weight gain. In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; so indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours. Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients. Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets had significantly reduced incidence of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5 kg), they would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and commensal bacterial growth, and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation. Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, psyllium and cellulose.\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of strict animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy over fat when provided, even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat. Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein. Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food. The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is L-carnitine. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein, and is the only form found in nature as well as being the only biologically active form. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation. At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 1995 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the National Research Council (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions. However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"\n\nDry cat food (kibble) is most often packed in multi-wall paper bags, sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used. Wet cat food is often packed in aluminum cans or steel cans. Packaging regulations for cat food are often very similar to corresponding regulations for human foods.\n\nThe energy requirements for adult cats range from 60–70 kcal metabolizable energy/kg body weight (BW) per day for inactive cats to 80–90 kcal/kg BW for active cats. Kittens at five weeks of age require 250 kcal/kg BW. The requirement drops with age, to 100 kcal/kg BW at 30 weeks and to the adult requirement at about 50 weeks. Gestating cats require approximately 90–100 kcal/kg BW, up to 1.5 times the energy required of normal adult maintenance. Lactating cats require 90–270 kcal/kg BW depending on litter size and they require between 2 and 2.5 times the energy needed for normal adult maintenance.\n\nVitamin deficiencies can lead to wide-ranging clinical abnormalities that reflect the diversity of their metabolic roles. Twelve minerals are known to be essential nutrients for cats. Calcium and phosphorus are crucial to strong bones and teeth. Cats need other minerals, such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cell signaling. Many minerals only present in minute amounts in the body, including selenium, copper, and molybdenum, act as helpers in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions.\n\nThe table below lists the AAFCO nutritional profiles for cat foods along with the roles of vitamins and minerals in cat nutrition according to the National Research Council.\n\nFurther information: Cat skin disorders\n\nMany nutrients can cause a variety of deficiency symptoms in cats, and the skin is a vital organ that is susceptible to dietary changes in minerals, protein, fatty acids, and vitamins A and B. Cat's show dietary inadequacies in their skin through excess or inadequate oil production, and skin toughening. This results in dandruff, redness, hair loss, greasy skin, and reduced hair growth.\n\nGood overall nutrition is needed along with a well balanced diet. If problems with a greasy and dull looking coat or flaky skin arise this could be signs of a greater internal issue. It is possible that the cat is not getting the proper nutrients in the proper quantities in their diet. This can be see more commonly with cats that eat diets that are of poorer quality.\n\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular metabolism. Zinc also supports proper immune function and suitable activity within the inflammatory response. Deficiencies result in disorders of the skin and poor immune functioning. When zinc is supplemented in diets, skin scaliness was decreased. Dietary sources include poultry, red meat, and eggs.\n\nOne of the many functions of copper is to assist in production of connective tissue and the pigment melanin. A deficiency in dietary copper is also related to collagen abnormalities, hypopigmentation of the skin, and alopecia. Sources for cats include liver and supplements in the forms of copper sulfate and cupric oxide.\n\nSelenium works with vitamin E as antioxidants to handle the free radicals that are damaging to the body and the skin. Selenium also plays a role with other antioxidants to help maintain cell membranes which provides further protection from free radicals causing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in development of skin diseases. Dietary sources of selenium are naturally occurring in selenomethionine and tuna.\n\nFatty acids are an important part of the cats diet, some are more important than others with respect to the cats diet and these are known as essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are nutrients that cats are unable to produce at all or in sufficient amounts to reach their needs. There are 3 essential fatty acids that should be included in a cats diets and they are: Alpha-Linolenic acid, Linoleic acid, and Arachidonic acid. Alpha-Linolenic acid is an Omega–3 fatty acid that is important to cats as it aids in the maintenance of their skin's water barrier. As the water barrier is important to the cats skin, ingredients that are high in Alpha-Linolenic acid, such as flaxseed, should be included in the cats diet. Another source of Omega-3 s are in fish oil however, it is higher in Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which can be important for cats as they have anti-inflammatory properties. Linoleic acid is an example of an Omega-6 fatty acid that also helps with the health of the cat's skin by maintaining the integrity of their epithelial tissues. Linoleic acid is commonly found in plant-based oils, an ingredient that is commonly used as a source of Linoleic acid is sunflower oil. Arachidonic acid is also essential to cats because they are unable to create it from linoleic acid due to an absence of the Delta 6 desaturase enzyme. It's important for their skin for the same reason as Linoleic acid and can be found in ingredients such as animal fat.\n\nVitamin A is a crucial nutritional component in the maintenance of feline skin and coat health. In addition to its many other functions, vitamin A plays an important role in the keratinization of the skin, hair and nails along with assisting in the development of various epithelial tissues throughout the body. The cells making up the epithelial tissues of the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts rely on vitamin A to successfully complete the process of mitosis in order preserve these tissues and repair any damages. The mucous secreting cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium also specifically require vitamin A to successfully produce a specialized protein referred to as mucoproteins which aid in maintaining the health of these tissues. Unlike most other mammals, the cat is unique in that they are unable to transform B-carotene to vitamin A and therefore explicitly require active forms of vitamin A which are only found in animal products. This difference in metabolism is due to very low levels of activity of the enzyme B-carotene 15, 15’ dioxygenase in feline species. The nutrient profiles developed by AAFCO currently advise a minimum of 3332 IU/kg of vitamin A on a dry matter basis included in adult diets and 6668 IU/kg in the diets of growing kittens as well as pregnant or lactating female cats. Common ingredients which help to incorporate the proper levels of vitamin A into feline diets include various types of liver as well as fish oils.\n\nVitamin E is an essential nutrient which needs to be included in the feline diet in order to protect the lipid components within cellular membranes of various tissues in the body. Vitamin E is able to accomplish this through working with selenium and acting as an antioxidant to prevent free radicals from interacting with these fatty acid membrane components, resulting in reduced levels of oxidative stress. This is particularly important in the skin as various oxidative environmental components can have very damaging effects if not protected by vitamin E. The nutrient profiles developed by AAFCO currently advise a minimum dry matter inclusion of 40 IU/kg of vitamin E in the diet of cats throughout all stages of development. Lipid metabolism is also a major contributor of free radicals, leading to an increased dietary requirement of vitamin E as the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet increase. Ingredients such as wheat germ as well as certain plant oils contain high levels of active vitamin E and are commonly added to feline diets which are carefully stored in order to prevent oxidative destruction of vitamin E prior to consumption.\n\nBiotin can be provided in feline diets through the addition of cooked eggs, liver, milk, legumes or nuts. Microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tracts of cats are also able to synthesize and supply an alternative source of biotin if proper nutritional requirements are met. Its main function in metabolism is to operate as a coenzyme for essential carboxylation reactions throughout the body1 however it has also been shown to aid in the management of certain skin diseases in cats. Biotin is recommended by AAFCO to be included in feline diets at a minimum level of 0.07 mg/kg on a dry matter basis throughout all stages of development.\n\nUnlike humans, felines are able to utilize simple sugars glucose and galactose in a specialized pathway which occurs in the liver, referred to as the glucuronate pathway. This pathway ultimately produces the active form of vitamin C and maintains it at an adequate level, therefore it does not need to be separately included in their diet.\n\nTherapeutic diets with low protein have been adopted by a number of big pet food manufacturers with the goal of supporting renal health for cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease or CKD is a highly prevalent condition in the feline population and is most common in the aging and older domesticated feline. It has been shown that the lifespan of cats experiencing CKD can be extended by as much as 2 years when receiving therapeutic diets rather than regular maintenance diets. The normal functions of the kidneys are to control a normal fluid balance and to excrete waste products from the blood into the urine. One of the biggest concerns associated to CKD is to reduce the amount of stress put on the kidneys to process and excrete nitrogenous wastes from the body. Low protein diets are a good choice for cats experiencing CKD as it lowers the amount of nitrogenous waste in the body helping to decease the strain put on the kidneys. Nitrogenous wastes are produced by the body when amino acids obtained from the digestion of protein are metabolized to make energy. The exact level of protein that is needed for therapeutic CKD diets is unclear, as sufficient protein in needed for maintenance while still offering a lower nitrogen level for the kidneys.\n\nLow protein diets can be formulated as a wet or dry food, with the main difference being the moisture content. These diets are formulated specifically to support the kidneys and urinary tract and also to help prevent the progression of CKD. There are certain dietary parameters that these diets follow on top of low protein such as low phosphorus, high energy density, a higher fat content and inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids to aid the kidneys in different ways. Formulating the diet to have low phosphorus is very important as restricting the amount in the diet has been proven to decrease the progression of CKD. The reason that plasma phosphorus concentration should be kept low for low protein therapeutic diets is because phosphorus can be deposited into soft tissues and become mineralized which can cause kidney damage. Formulating these diets with higher amounts of fat is important to make sure the food is palatable in the absence of protein and promote an increased caloric intake. The higher fat content will also spare the use of protein for energy and help decrease stress on kidney. This inclusion of higher fat content also increase the energy density of the food which is important for cats with decreased appetites. Omega-3 fatty acids are included in therapeutic diets because of their anti-inflammatory properties to aid the diseased kidneys.\n\nLow protein diets should not be fed to cats with the liver condition known as hepatic encephalopathy because severe protein restriction can be detrimental to animals with this condition. Cats with this condition should be fed a diet with high quality protein sources that have adequate amounts of the amino acids taurine and arginine.\n\nA high energy diet is generally high in fat. Compared to carbohydrates and protein, fat provides much more energy, at 8.5 kcal/g. High energy diets generally have a fat content greater than 20% on a dry matter basis. A high energy diet is appropriate for cats who are undergoing growth, recovering from illness, are pregnant or lactating, as their energy requirements are higher than otherwise. A lactating or gestating cat requires a nutrient-dense and highly digestible diet to withstand the high levels of stress being placed on her body. These conditions are found in cat food that is formulated for growth, performance, or high energy during all life stages.\n\nTo maintain a neutral energy balance and thus maintain body weight, energy intake should increase with energy expenditure. Studies that relate the number of meals offered to cats per day to their daily activity levels have shown conflicting results. It has been shown that cats offered four meals a day or a random number of meals a day have similar energy levels, greater than those fed only one meal per day. It has been postulated that this increased energy level could be due to purported spikes in activity before being fed, known as food anticipatory activity. Other studies on female cats have found that increasing the daily amount of food may actually decrease their daily activity levels. The age, sex, and whether cats are intact or have been spayed/neutered are all factors controlling activity level.\n\nAs cats age, there is evidence that their metabolic energy requirements may increase, especially after 12 or 13 years old, but other evidence suggests that metabolic energy needs are not dissimilar at different ages. Furthermore, it has been shown that cats over 12 years old are more likely to be underweight than younger cats, so a high calorie diet may be appropriate to treat weight loss, and thus to maintain an appropriate body condition score. Weight loss can occur when the cat expends more energy but does not increase its food energy intake. It has also been demonstrated that as cats age, they are less able to digest and thus absorb dietary fats and proteins.\n\nPregnancy and lactation are strenuous periods on the female cat. During pregnancy a cat should gain 38% of their body weight by the time they are ready to give birth. It is recommended that a cat's diet should contain 4000 kcal ME per day while pregnant; during lactation it is recommended that the cat consumes 240 - 354 kcal/ME / kg of body weight. Studies show that increasing the intake of food for a pregnant animal in order to help it gain weight can have negative effects. It is acknowledged that rather than increasing intake, feeding a highly energy dense food is a way to ensure that the female cat, or queen, receives adequate energy and nutrient requirements are met.\n\nIt has been found that nutritional support consistent with the resting energy requirement (RER) soon after surgery or the onset of illness decreases the mortality rate and the duration of hospitalization in cats. A recovering cat needs enough energy (calories), as well as more protein and fats. Critical care diets are formulated to be highly palatable and digestible, as well as high energy density. This limits the mass of food required to be consumed to meet the RER. This type of high energy diet has proven to be very important in the nutritional support of post-operative and ill cats.\n\nVegetarian or vegan cat food has been available for many years, and is targeted primarily at vegan and vegetarian pet owners. While a small percentage of owners choose such a diet based on its perceived health benefits, the majority do so due to ethical concerns. Despite this, most vegans who feed their cats a vegan diet believe that a vegetarian diet is healthier than a conventional diet. There is much controversy over feeding cats a vegetarian diet. While there is anecdotal evidence that cats do well on vegetarian food, studies on commercial and homemade vegetarian cat foods have found nutritional inadequacies.\n\nAs obligate carnivores, cats require nutrients (including arginine, taurine, arachidonic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and niacin) found in meat sources. Plant sources do not contain enough of these. Vegetarian pet food companies try to correct these deficiencies by adding synthetically produced nutrients. According to the United States National Research Council, \"Cats require specific nutrients, not specific feedstuffs.\"\n\nCats on a vegan diet can develop abnormally alkaline (high pH) urine as plant-based proteins are more alkaline than the meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of struvite (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.\n\nOrganizations that advocate vegan or vegetarian diets for people have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food. The International Vegetarian Union, the Vegan Society and PETA are some of the organizations that support a vegan or vegetarian diet for cats. But the Vegetarian Society suggests people \"consider carefully\" and that many cats will not adjust to a vegetarian diet. They provide a list of necessary nutrients that would need to be supplemented, and recommend that those who want to try should consult a veterinarian or animal nutritionist. The Animal Protection Institute also does not recommend a vegetarian diet for cats, and cautions that dietary deficiencies may take months or years to develop and may be untreatable. They do not recommend relying on supplements, because they may not contain necessary co-factors and enzymes and have not been studied for long term implications. The animal welfare organization American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, although suggesting a supplemented vegetarian diet for dogs, recommends against vegetarian and vegan diets for cats. The Association of Veterinarians for Animal Rights (now Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association) accepts that a plant-based diet can be nutritionally adequate, but stated in August 2006 that such diets \"cannot at this time be reliably assured\". This position was based on a 2004 study demonstrating that of both of the two commercially available vegetarian cat diets tested against the AAFCO standard were nutritionally deficient. The formulation error in one of these diets was promptly identified and corrected. Nevertheless, it remains likely that formulation errors will result in nutritional deficiencies in a wide range of commercially available diets from time to time, whether meat-based, vegetarian or vegan. Hence, regular (at least, annual) veterinary checkups of all companion animals is recommended, and brands may be occasionally varied.\n\nEven when adequately supplemented, vegetarian diets may present other risks, such as urine acidity problems. While there are anecdotal reports linking a vegetarian diet with urinary tract problems, no documented case report or study exists. One vegan cat food manufacturer has stated that \"because of the relative acidity of meat to vegetable protein, some vegan cats suffer from <nowiki>[Urinary tract problems]</nowiki>.\" A quarter of cat owners who feed their cats a vegetarian diet perceive feline lower urinary tract disease as a health risk of such a diet.\n\nIn 2006, the first study of the health of a population of long-term vegetarian cats was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Most of the cats were fed a commercially available vegan diet, though 35% were allowed outdoors. The study consisted of telephone questionnaires of the caregivers of 32 cats, and analysis of blood samples from some of the cats. The blood samples were tested for taurine and cobalamin deficiencies. Cobalamin levels were normal in all cats. Taurine levels were low in 3 out of 17 cats tested, but not low enough to be considered clinically deficient. 97% of the caregivers perceived their cats to be healthy, including those with low taurine levels.\n\nFormulation of a nutritionally adequate vegan cat diet has its limitations. Recurring errors during formulation include insufficient protein content, insufficient calcium and phosphorus, along with an unbalanced calcium to phosphorus ratio which strays from the ideal range of 0.9:1 to 1.1:1. This is in addition to commonly occurring deficiencies of taurine, arachidonic acid, sodium, vitamin A, vitamin B12 as well as trace minerals.\n\nThe reason for these dietary essential nutrients can be found in the physiology section of the Cat page.\n\nProtein and fat content in a vegan cat diet can be balanced by the inclusion of tofu and yeast. Over the counter supplementation of vitamins and minerals in some cases may not meet nutrient requirements, as they come in varying amounts. As vegan diets are mainly derived from plant sources, some vitamins and minerals may be deficient, as plant sources do not provide adequate quantities. For instance, plant materials do not provide the preformed vitamin A which cats cannot synthesize, therefore supplementation is needed. As mentioned previously, arginine is a dietary requirement of cats, as it plays a critical role in bodily functions (refer to the physiology section in the Cat page). Some ingredients of vegan cat diets that provide arginine, are pumpkin seed, almond, soya flour, lentil seeds and oat flakes (see table one).[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarina_Babinska/publication/7562990_Health_benefits_and_risks_of_plant_proteins/links/0f31752f800b879c05000000.pdf <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] The arachidonic acid added to cat foods typically comes from animal-based sources. In vegan cat diets, arachidonic acid can be added by including algal biomass or seaweed; but too much seaweed can be detrimental, as it may contain enough selenium to be toxic. A vitamin D3 source, lanolin, a constituent of sheep's wool, is often used to provide that vitamin. However, due to its animal origin this would not be appropriate for supplemental use in a vegan cat diet so a synthetic form of vitamin D3 is required. Vegan vitamin D3 can be synthesized by combining lichen, chicory extract and chamomile extract. Some vegan sources with high niacin content are Brewer's yeast, oats, wheat flours, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds. AAFCO requires cat food to have 60 mg of niacin per kg of cat food on a dry matter basis. Taurine can be biosynthesized or can be obtained in the diet by eating animal sources for food or algae. For cats, taurine is an essential amino acid as they cannot biosynthesize it from the amino acids methionine or cysteine; so they must obtain it endogenously. Enough synthetic taurine must be added to a vegan cat diet, as plant sources do not have taurine. (refer to the physiology section on the Cat page).\n\nProtein content between cat foods can vary anywhere from a low protein content of 26% to a content as high as 50% or above. The National Research Council (NRC) recommends protein content for cat diets is to be around 20% for adult maintenance and 21.3% for growth and reproduction The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) recommendations however suggest a higher protein level of 26% for adult maintenance and 30% for growth and reproduction.\n\nCats are obligate carnivores and require protein in their diet as an important component in energy metabolism and maintenance of lean body muscle. Cats are greatly adapted to a high protein diet since they utilize protein as their main energy source, keeping carbohydrate utilization very minimal. In addition, cats will continue to metabolize protein even through protein deficiency by catabolizing lean body muscle. More specifically cats like most mammals, require the appropriate dietary amino acid balance to supply the essential amino acids, which are used for a multitude of body functions. It is crucial for low protein diets to meet AAFCO recommendations to ensure nutrient requirements are met.\n\nIn general, lower protein diets tend to consist of a greater carbohydrate content, which means a potentially higher glycemic response in cats. Glycemic response refers to the response of glucose concentrations in the blood after a meal. Hexokinase is the enzyme cats use for metabolizing glucose because they do not possess the more efficient enzyme glucokinase. Cats are susceptible to high prolonged postprandial glucose and insulin periods with high glucose peaks, resulting from the carbohydrate content of the diet. The degree of glucose peaks and the duration of the elevated glucose levels ultimately depends on the glycemic index of the carbohydrates used in the diet. Typically a diet of low protein is replaced with added carbohydrate content. In some cases, fat can be added to lower protein diets in order to increase the energy density of the food product.\n\nA nutritional balance of amino acids is important in low protein cat diets as cats are highly sensitive to deficiencies in arginine, taurine, methionine, and cysteine. Therefore, supplementation of these essential amino acids is important and commonly found in cat foods. The supplementation of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids is common in products with lower protein as it plays a positive role in protecting the kidneys which is an issue for many cats on a low protein diet. Similarly, mineral composition is important and low protein diets result in a low phosphorus content that benefits the renal care and prevention of kidney disease.\n\nFeeding a lower protein content can help lower the amount of calcium being excreted in the feces and urine. It has been observed that urinary calcium concentrations and fecal calcium excretion is related to increasing protein concentration in the diet. Increasing calcium in the urine and feces can indicate increased calcium mobilization (for example of bone) within a cat instead of increased intestinal calcium absorption. Lower protein fed to cats can also decrease renal oxalate excretion, and therefore, decrease renal oxalate and calcium concentrations to support the decrease in urinary calcium concentrations, which contributes to the decrease in urinary relative saturations with calcium oxalate and can decrease the probability of a cat developing calcium oxalate stones.\n\nA lower amount of harmful bacteria is accumulated with a lower protein diet which helps to increase the amount of positive bacteria present in the gut.\n\nIn low protein diets, unless the protein source is a high quality protein such as an animal-based protein, cats (and especially kittens) have been shown to develop retinal degeneration due to a deficiency in taurine, an essential amino acid for cats that is derived from animal protein.\n\nSince cats have such a high protein requirement, lower protein content, and thus lower amino acid concentrations, in the diet has been linked to health defects such as lack of growth, decreased food intake, muscle atrophy, hypoalbuminemia, skin alterations, and more. Cats on lower protein diets are more likely to lose weight, and to lose lean body mass.\n\nLow protein diets that are high in carbohydrates have been found to decrease glucose tolerance in cats. With a decreased glucose tolerance, clinical observations have confirmed that cats consuming large proportions of metabolizable energy, in the form of carbohydrates rather than protein, are more likely to develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and obesity.\n\nCats have a high priority for gluconeogenesis to provide energy for tissues like the brain. The rate at which it operates does not change despite having a low protein diet. Despite now being able to down-regulate gluconeogenesis, cats are able to regulate their amino acid catabolism in response to a low protein diet, probably by increasing the synthesis of enzyme proteins without altering the catalytic rate. This collectively can make a cat \"wasteful\" of amino acids supplied in a low protein diet.\n\nLow protein diets have been shown to lower the levels of in cats, which impacts the overall function of the immune system.\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract is the source of nutrient absorption, making it integral to overall health. Therefore, feeding your cat for optimal digestive health is key for a healthy cat. Research shows fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, antioxidants and fatty acids are important in maintaining gastrointestinal health.\n\nThe addition of fiber at optimal levels in a diet is essential for the normal function and health of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDietary fibers are plant carbohydrates which cannot be digested by mammalian enzymes. These structural plant carbohydrates include pectin, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, muclinage, and gums. Different types of fibers have varying levels of solubility and fermentation; this ranges from pectin which is highly fermentable, to beet pulp which is moderately fermentable, to cellulose which is non-fermentable. Non-fermentable fibers helps with satiety, maintenance of a normal intestinal transit time and gastrointestinal motility as well as increasing diet bulk. Fermentable fibers, on the other hand, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the colon and have variable effects on gastric emptying. Moderately soluble fibers have been linked to increased colon weight as well as an increased mucosal surface area for absorption of nutrients.\n\nFiber, though it is not an essential nutrient, is important for a healthy gastrointestinal tract. The microbes found in the cat's large intestine have the ability to ferment dietary fibers to short-chain fatty acids. Cells of the gastrointestinal tract are constantly dying and being replaced by new cells, which requires a lot of energy. The fatty acids produced are used as energy sources for these epithelial cells which line the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of the presence of energy from the fatty acids, colonic cell proliferation is increases.\n\nShort-chain fatty acids production from dietary fibers have many other advantageous effects on the gastrointestinal tract. They increase motility by stimulating rhythmic contractions of the distal portion of the small intestine, which potentially decreases fermentation in the small intestine while increasing it in the large intestine for further fatty acid absorption. Blood flow to the colon also increases with the presence of short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids also increase sodium absorption which helps maintain normal electrolyte and fluid balance in the intestine, reducing the risk for diarrhea . These homeostatic conditions of the intestinal tract promote the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting the proliferation of pathogenic ones. A healthy and balanced gut microbiome is important for maintaining a healthy digestive tract.\n\nFibers promote bacterial growth and activity in the large intestine. It is essential for a healthy gastrointestinal tract to have a healthy and stable gut microbiota. The microorganisms present in the colon are responsible for the fermentation of the fiber into short-chain fatty acids and for the production of some vitamins.\n\nPrebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates classified as fibers with an added aspect as they selectively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. By promoting the health and proliferation of beneficial bacteria, they suppress the growth of pathogenic ones by outcompeting them. Insulin, galactooligosaccharides, lactulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS) are all examples of prebiotics.\n\nProbiotics are becoming increasingly popular in the diets of felines. They are included in the diet to increase the number of bacteria and microbes that are normally present in a healthy gut. Probiotics are considered a supplement rather than part of nutrition. Therefore, there are no strict regulations to the amount of probiotics that should be included in foods. The function of probiotics goes beyond basic nutrition and has many benefits to the health of the organism. The use of probiotics can help in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases or disorders of felines. Examples include prevention of allergies, diarrhea, symptoms relating to stress, etc. The health of the cats is very much dependent on the fermentation that occurs through gut biota. The gut biota has an important role in the metabolism, absorption, and protective functions of the gastro intestinal tract. Felines have different gut bacteria than canines. However, the most common biota that are found in both felines and canines are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria . Although these are the most common types of gut biota found in felines, there are variances between independent cats. Each cat has their own unique and independent number and type of gut microbes.\n\nNutraceuticals such as antioxidants are considered to be additives of gastrointestinal diets to prevent digestive upset. Antioxidants have the ability to remove free radicals from the body which can cause damage to cell membranes, and are involved in chronic degenerative diseases. Free radicals amplify inflammation by causing release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Free radicals can be caused by many factors such as stress, disease and age. Some oxygen-derived free radicals can produce ischemia in the small bowel and stomach of cats. Combinations of antioxidants have been reported to improve serum vitamin status, suppress lipid peroxidation and distributes the effects of exercise on the immune system. The most common antioxidants found in cat gastrointestinal diets are vitamin E and vitamin C.\n\nThe addition of Vitamin E as an antioxidant in gastrointestinal health cat food diets can have a positive effect of improving the animal's immune function and prevent against infections. Vitamin E is a free radical scavenger that functions as a chain-breaking antioxidant to prevent free radical damage of cell membranes. Vitamin E aids in protecting cells from highly reactive oxygen species within the lungs, muscles, skin, brain, tissues and red blood cells. Supplementation of vitamin E in the diet benefits the immune system and improves resistance to infections and diseases.\n\nThe National Research Council (NRC) suggested a ratio of vitamin E to polyunsaturated fatty acids be 0.6:1 to ensure enough vitamin E to combat any free radicals. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are prone to oxidative destruction in cellular membranes and increases the requirement for antioxidants.\n\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble antioxidant and a free radical scavenger where it will donate an electron to compounds with unpaired elections or reactive but not radical compounds. Supplements of Vitamin C reduced oxidative DNA damage in cats prone to renal insufficiency, and can be beneficial to add into diets for cats suffering from renal diseases. Vitamin C is not essential for cats as it is not required by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), however is commonly added into pet foods as an antioxidant. Ascorbic acid is known to not only be an antioxidant, but also to function in gene expression, as a co-substrate, and have unique biosynthetic pathways in different organisms.\n\nA fat is a type of lipid which comes in the form of many different molecules throughout the body, and fatty acids are just one type of fat that can be found. \nFatty acids come in a variety of molecular shapes, sizes and chemical compositions. They can also be divided into many different categories. Fatty acids can become attached to different molecules like carbohydrates or proteins and can elicit a wide range of functions in the body. Some of those functions include: providing long-term energy storage, insulation (prevents heat loss, protects vital organs, helps transmit nerve impulses faster), structure, transportation around the body for nutrients and other biological molecules, and can also be precursors to other compounds in the body such as hormones (some of which are important for gut/immune/overall health). The length, degree of saturation and configuration of a fatty acid affects how it is broken down, absorbed and utilized in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).\n\nInflammation is the process by which the body begins to heal and defend itself from viral and bacterial infections and physical damage like burns or cuts. Typical signs of inflammation are: redness, swelling, heat, pain and loss of function in the affected area. The inflammatory response is a normal response for the body to make when injured but if the response gets out of control or becomes excessive, it can cause damage in the host with a wide range of effects from mild allergies to severe GIT diseases. Inflammation is then an important response to focus on because it is very involved in the host's defense mechanisms and is often involved in GIT diseases. The inflammatory process begins with intracellular and intercellular communication around the body using chemical mediators like chemokines and cytokines, which left unregulated can get out of control and cause excessive inflammation. Anti-inflammatories and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids can influence the initiation and severity of the inflammatory response, controlling factors like intracellular signaling cascades and receptors for inflammatory molecules. Fat (adipose tissue) is also an important and potent mediator in the inflammatory process and therefore regulation of fat stores is important in keeping the inflammatory response in the body under control.\n\nTo achieve optimal cellular health (especially in the gut) and to maintain a healthy microbiome, proper nutrition is necessary (nutrition is multifactorial and complex). \nCats with GI diseases must consume an easily digestible diet with the appropriate nutrients provided by easily digestible ingredients and in the correct ratio which is recommended to be fed in small portions frequently throughout the day, so as o not overwhelm the digestive system. \nIt is also important for fat to be digestible because too much undigested fat that reaches the end of the digestive tract (colon) has the possibility of being fermented and can worsen the symptoms of GIT disease and induce other reactions like diarrhea. \nIt has also been suggested that cats should eat diets tailored to the section of the GIT that is diseases. \nWhen certain nutrients like fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are included in the diet, the microbiome and fatty acid content are often changed for the better. An example would be less branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs; which are more difficult and take more time to digest) are produced and more short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; which are easier to digest and are more readily available sources of energy which can be used for supporting cell turnover keeping cells, like those found in the GIT, healthier thereby improving GIT health and immune function) are produced.\nFOS can also impact production of other fatty acids.\n\nCats have a higher tolerance for a greater amount of fat in the diet, and although its digestion is complex and important (pertaining to its many functions and its influence on immune and inflammatory responses), fat composition in the diet appears to have a small effect on GI disease in cats. \nTaurine is an essential sulphur-containing amino acid for cats and some other mammals with many unique essential functions, one of which is the conjugation of bile acids which are important in the metabolism of fatty acids. \nFat levels are important so that the animal wants to eat the diet. So, although high levels of fat may be detrimental, too low a fat level in the diet and the animal will not eat it. Low levels may be only beneficial if the GI disease involves maldigestion, malabsorption and/or influences the population of bacteria in the gut too much.\n\nOne group of fatty acids that is particularly important for gastrointestinal (GI) health is the essential fatty acid (EFA) group. All EFAs are polyunsaturated (they have more than one double bond in their fatty acid chain). EFAs are important to have in the diet in adequate amounts, especially for the cat, as since they are essential (meaning the body produces little to none so it must be included in the diet) and cats have very low activity or simply lack the digestive enzymes to generate the EFAs that are important in mediating the inflammatory response. EFAs also vary in size, have many different functions and can also be further divided into other categories, two of which are very important for GI health: the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids (the omega in the name denotes the position of the first double bond in a fatty acid counting from the methyl end). These fatty acids are most effective when present in adequate and appropriate balanced ratios dependent upon stage of life and production of the animal. One very important function of EFAs is the production of eicosanoids (molecules that are important in immune and inflammatory regulation). \nEicosanoids are like hormones and act in a local fashion with short lives. \nDifferent EFAs have different effects on the inflammatory response. \nOmega-6 fatty acids at high levels can suppress the functions of the immune system (large part of which is located in the GIT) and promote inflammation, platelet aggregation and hypersensitive reactions like allergies. \nOmega-3 fatty acids act in the opposite direction of omega-6 fatty acids by: promoting anti-inflammation and depressing aggregation and immunosuppression. \nRatio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids can be changed using diet, optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is considered to be within the range of 5:1 to 10:1. \nThe right ratio (different for everyone as everyone is unique) helps reduce inflammation and mediate immune responses as both omega fatty acids utilize the same enzymes in their metabolic journey. \nSome sources of omega-6 fatty acids include: corn oil, sunflower oil and soybean oil. \nSome sources of omega-3 fatty acids include: cold-water fish oil, flaxseed, canola oil and soybean oil.\n\nThere is very little research on cats in general, especially when diving into very targeted topics like GIT health of cats and the effects of fatty acids of any length on their digestive system, especially cats with GIT disorders. \nGIT diseases are common in cats and it has been suggested that in the case of long-term GI diseases, diet is extremely important in modulation and manipulating the effects. \nLevels of fat included in the diet should be studied more and monitored as not only does adipose tissue play a role in the inflammatory process, but it is also used as a palatant to make food more appealing. As fat is high in energy, overeating (which can cause an animal to become overweight or obese) is not uncommon in foods with high levels of fat as fats are very palatable. Although not well studied, evidence from previous studies completed in animals and humans (who have similar digestive tracts to cats) suggest a proper ratio and use of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids will help mediate inflammatory diseases, especially ones present in the GIT.\n\nMany pet owners feed cats homemade diets. These diets generally consist of some form of cooked or raw meat, bone, vegetables, and supplements, such as taurine and Multivitamins. Homemade diets either follow a recipe, such as the BARF diet which provides a series of options for the pet owner to make, or rely on the constant rotation of ingredients to meet nutrient requirements. A study was conducted that analyzed 95 homemade BARF diets and found that 60% of these were nutritionally imbalanced in either one or a combination of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, iodine, zinc, copper, or vitamin A content.\n\nA 2004 study reported that food packaged in cans coated with bisphenol A is correlated with the development of hyperthyroidism in cats.\n\nFood allergy is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is excessive scratching (pruritus) which is usually resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy/flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with dietary elimination-challenge trials. Allergy testing is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).\n\nMalnutrition can be a problem for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed exclusively on raw, freshwater fish can develop a thiamine deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop vitamin A toxicity. Also, exclusively meat-based diets may contain excessive protein and phosphorus whilst being deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Energy density must also be maintained relative to the other nutrients. When vegetable oil is used to maintain the energy balance cats may not find the food as palatable.\n\nThe broad pet food recalls starting in March 2007 came in response to reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company beginning in February 2007. Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of melamine in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.\n\nIn a study on the impacts of the pet food industry on world fish and seafood supplies, researchers estimate that 2.48 million metric tonnes of fish are used by the cat food industry each year. It was suggested that there needs to be \"a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource, for human benefit.\" Marine conservation activist Paul Watson argues that the reduction in forage fish such as those commonly used in cat food (sardines, herring, anchovy etc.) negatively affects fish higher up the food chain like cod, tuna and swordfish, not to mention marine mammals and birds.\n\nBased on 2004 numbers, cats in the US consume the caloric equivalent of what 192,000 (0.0655187%) Americans consume. While pet food is made predominantly using byproducts from human food productions, the increase in popularity of human-grade and byproduct-free pet food means there is increasing pressure on the overall meat supply.\n\nAAFCO recommends 26% crude protein for feline diets on a dry matter basis, however dry cat food from the top 3 cat food brands in Canada of 2010 contained 34%, 40%, and 36% protein respectively, on a dry matter basis. High animal protein in cat food has increased in popularity due to consumer demand for natural diets, in which protein content is usually much higher than the AAFCO minimum levels. The effects of these trends results in a higher need for animal protein, which may have detrimental effects on sustainability.\n\n6.4% of the USA's greenhouse gas emission is estimated to come from agriculture, and over 50% of the agricultural greenhouse gas emission comes from livestock. The large amount of livestock and fish protein used in pet food diets has been shown to have a much larger impact on the environment when compared to vegetable protein. Following only human trends, by 2050 approximately 1 billion hectares of land will need to be used for agriculture to sustain the human population.\n\nIn 2015, an estimated 77.8 million dogs and 85.6 millions cats were living in the USA. The consumer desire to feed their pets premium foods which advertise healthy and human-grade ingredients coupled with the increasing prevalence of pet ownership is causing increased pressure on the meat industry which could result in increased land usage for raising livestock to meet the growing demand. In a study conducted by Okin in 2017, he suggests that if a quarter of all animal protein used in the food of American pets was human-grade, it would be equivalent to the energy needs of 5 million Americans. Okin uses an estimate of 33% of an animal's energy needs is derived from animal products; however, this is conservative in that many diets now have more than 33% of their diet in animal protein alone. Lowering protein levels in feline diets may help to improve the sustainability of both the human and pet food system by decreasing pressure on livestock agriculture and ultimately improving environmental effects.\n\n\n"}

Common models include a hinged length of wire mounted horizontally on a wall, a thicker axle either recessed into a wall or mounted on a frame, or a freestanding vertical pole on a base. In recent years, automatic toilet paper dispensers which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in public toilets.\n\nIn the first case, the idea is that the toilet roll maintains contact with the door or wall as the roll's radius decreases. This provides enough friction to allow the user to tear off a piece of tissue. More sophisticated designs include a curved horizontal plate that covers the roll, thus removing the necessity of touching the roll. These roll holders can be used in both orientations, but may be difficult to use in the \"under\" orientation.\n\nThe horizontal axle design is found in most homes, and also in many schools. It is easy to use due to its low friction and ease of refilling. This is the type of holder most commonly assumed about when toilet paper orientation is mentioned.\n\nThis type of holder is not common, probably because it can get in the way of traffic getting on and off the toilet more than the horizontal axle in the wall.\n\nOriginally intended to hold a stock of replacement rolls, the vertical pole has become the only paper holder in some households. It is particularly useful in homes where the family has mixed handedness. Its drawbacks include that there is a lot more friction than in other types of toilet roll holders, and thus not as easy to use.\n\nThe holders in many public toilets are designed to make it difficult for patrons to steal the toilet rolls. Various contraptions have been devised to lock the spare rolls away, and release them only when the active roll is used up.\n\nAn increasing number of public toilets are furnished with holders that hold very large rolls of toilet paper. These are designed to save money by reducing the frequency of janitorial services to restock the paper.\n\nIn many toilets, especially in elementary schools, a dispenser releases only a small square of toilet paper to prevent a user from intentionally clogging the toilet with large amounts of paper.\n\n"}

When called Lik-M-Aid, it consisted of 4 packets of flavored and colored sugar. When rebranded in the 1970s as Fun Dip, two edible candy sticks called \"Lik-A-Stix\" were added. While the original flavors consisted of lime, cherry and grape, the most common flavors are cherry, grape, and a raspberry/apple combination that turns from blue when dry to green when wet with saliva or water. It also comes in sour flavors, including sour watermelon, sour apple, and sour lemonade. There is also orange flavored Fun Dip.

{"id": "1136752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1136752", "title": "Lefse", "text": "Lefse\n\nLefse () is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with potatoes, flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.\n\nThere are many ways of flavoring lefse. The most common is adding butter to the lefse and rolling it up. In Norway, this is known as \"lefse-klenning\". Other options include adding cinnamon and/or sugar, or spreading jelly, lingonberries or gomme on it. Scandinavian-American variations include rolling it with a thin layer of peanut butter and sugar, with butter and white or brown sugar, with butter and corn syrup, or with ham and eggs. Also eaten with beef and other savory items like Ribberull and mustard, it is comparable to a tortilla. Lefse is a traditional accompaniment to lutefisk, and the fish is often rolled up in the lefse.\n\nThere are significant regional variations in Norway in the way lefse is made and eaten, but it generally resembles a flatbread, although in many parts of Norway, especially Valdres, it is far thinner.\n\nTynnlefse (thin lefse) is a variation made in central Norway. Tynnlefse is rolled up with butter, sugar and cinnamon (or with butter and brown sugar).\n\nTjukklefse or tykklefse is thicker and often served with coffee as a cake.\n\nPotetlefse (potato lefse) is similar to and used as tynnlefse, but made with potatoes.\n\nPotetkake or Lompe being the \"smaller-cousin\" of the potato lefse, is often used in place of a hot-dog bun and can be used to roll up sausages. This is also known as \"pølse med lompe\" in Norway.\n\nMøsbrømlefse is a variation common to Salten district in Nordland in North Norway. Møsbrømmen consists of half water and half the cheese smooth with flour or corn flour to a half thick sauce that greased the cooled lefse. Lefse is ready when møsbrømmen is warm and the butter is melted.\n\nNordlandslefse is a chunky small lefse. Made of butter, syrup, sugar, eggs and flour. Originally created in western Norway as a treat to fishermen who were on the Lofoten Fishery.\n\nAnislefse is made on the coast of Hordaland. It resembles thin lefse but is slightly thicker, and it is stained by large amounts of whole aniseed.\n\nAnother variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is made from yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). Additionally, it is often made with egg yolks and buttermilk instead of potatoes. The dough is rolled with a conventional rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F or 205 °C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.\n\nDried Hardangerlefse can be stored without refrigeration for six months or more, so long as it is kept dry. It is customarily thought that the bread (along with solefisk) was a staple on the seagoing voyages as far back as Viking times.\n\nThe wet lefse is dipped in water, and then placed within a towel which has also been dipped in water and wrung out. Many people maintain that dipping in salted or seawater enhances the flavor. The dry lefse regains its bread-like texture in about 60 minutes. Often that time is used to prepare such ingredients as eggs or herring which are wrapped in the lefse once it has softened.\n\nLefse is a Scandinavian treat that is especially popular around the Christmas holidays. Many Scandinavian-Americans eat lefse primarily around Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nWhile the Midwest generally always makes its lefse with potatoes, this is not necessarily the case in Norway. When one uses the term “lefse” in the United States, it more than often refers to what Norwegians call potato lefse. Norwegians, however, also make Hardanger lefse with egg yolks and buttermilk. The tradition of making lefse was brought over by Norwegian Americans, and potato lefse itself was made when their potato crop was successful. Due to this, it became more prevalently made than other types in the United States. When lefse was able to be made, it was stored in small storage buildings called bryggehaus. When Norwegian immigrants first arrived in America, they did not have the usual foods they were used to back home, including milk and porridge, dried meat, and lefse, but early Norwegian-American immigrants brought folded lefse to eat for the beginning stages of their immigration journey via ship. After these were eaten, the lack of food they were used to is likely why they turned back to tradition so quickly. \nDuring World War I, Americans were encouraged to eat potatoes to be patriotic, as the front lines needed the wheat grown at home. Lefse, a staple for Norwegian Americans, was eaten with gusto during this time.\nWhile lefse is generally not eaten with day-to-day meals in Norway today, Norwegian Americans traditionally give prominence to having lefse with their supper, considering it their specialty. Furthermore, that some Norwegian Americans still make lefse has been considered by some ethnic Norwegians to be unstylish, as it has fallen so out of tradition to hand-make the dish.\n\n\nIn Norway today, most families tend to purchase their lefse rather than making it. While today’s Norwegian Americans consider making lefse at Christmas a tradition, more families are turning to purchase it from the store instead. For example, around $80,000 worth of lefse is generally sold around Christmas from Ingebretsen’s Scandinavian Gifts in Minneapolis, Minnesota, yearly. Lefse can also be found in many grocery stores around Midwestern states, including Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon, Alaska and Washington. Norsland Lefse, a factory in Rushford, Minnesota, produces about a half million rounds of lefse each year. The foodway of Scandinavian lefse stretches from the Midwest all the way through northeastern Montana. Small lefse factories dot the landscape throughout this area, mostly in Norwegian communities. In the larger of these communities, Lefse can be found in grocery stores year round. In the Red River Valley specifically, “restaurants, supermarkets, and clubs all serve fish, lefse, and other specialties.” Additionally, many United States Scandinavian festivals have booths to sell lefse, and lefse can also be ordered directly from online.\n\nThe town of Starbuck, Minnesota, is the home of the world's largest lefse. It was made in July 1983.\n\nLefse is celebrated in cities and towns with large Scandinavian populations. Fargo, North Dakota, hosts the popular Lutefisk and Lefse Festival in August each year. Fosston, Minnesota, invites area lefse makers to compete for the title of Champion Lefse Maker at its Lefse Fest in November. In Mankato, Minnesota, Minnesotans of Scandinavian descent celebrate lefse day, a day for cooking lefse, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.\nThe Potato Days festival has been taking place in Barnesville, Minnesota, since the early 1930s; this festival also takes part in the National Lefse Cookoff.\n\nRumors surrounding the initial use of lefse are claims by Norwegian Americans that it was made by and used to sustain the Vikings, but potatoes were not introduced into Norway until long after the Vikings’ time. \nAlthough many Scandinavian-Americans do enjoy and eat the foods of their ethnic traditions, there is no shortage of tall-tales and jokes surrounding certain food, as well. Lefse was not excluded from these rumors. Lefse has been said to be “so tasteless that many mistakenly eat the paper doily under the stack and do not know the difference.”\n\nSometimes Norwegian foods are integrated into other ethnic foodways. For example, one may use lefse in order to make enchiladas, rather than tortillas. Additionally, American lefse is sometimes served with butter, cinnamon sugar, brown sugar, or lingonberry jelly before being rolled, to be eaten in a similar fashion to a crêpe. One may also choose eggs, sausage, and cheese to make it into a breakfast burrito. \nOne may also roll Smørrebrød into their lefse.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1138165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1138165", "title": "Classifier (linguistics)", "text": "Classifier (linguistics)\n\nA classifier (abbreviated ' or '), sometimes called a measure word or counter word, is a word or affix that is used to accompany nouns and can be considered to \"classify\" a noun depending on the type of its referent. Classifiers play an important role in the grammar of certain languages, especially East Asian languages, including Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. In European languages classifiers are absent or marginal; an example of a word that may be considered to have the function of a classifier in English is \"head\" in phrases like \"five head of cattle\".\n\nIn languages that have classifiers, they are often used when the noun is being counted, that is, when it appears with a numeral. In such languages, a phrase such as \"three people\" is often required to be expressed as \"three \"X\" (of) people\", where \"X\" is a classifier appropriate to the noun for \"people\". Classifiers sometimes have other functions too; in Chinese they are commonly used when a noun is preceded by a demonstrative (word meaning \"this\" or \"that\"). Chinese classifiers are also commonly called measure words, although some writers make a distinction between the two terms.\n\nClassifier handshapes appear in some sign languages; these may have a somewhat different grammatical function.\n\nCertain parallels can be drawn between classifier systems and noun classes, although there are significant differences. Languages with classifiers may have up to several hundred different classifiers, whereas those with noun classes (or in particular, genders) tend to have a smaller number of classes, not always much dependent on the nouns' meaning, and with a variety of grammatical consequences.\n\nA classifier is a word (or in some analyses, a bound morpheme) which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts, and generally reflects some kind of conceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents. Thus a language might have one classifier for nouns representing persons, another for nouns representing flat objects, another for nouns denoting periods of time, and so on. The assignment of classifier to noun may also be to some degree unpredictable, with certain nouns taking certain classifiers by historically established convention.\n\nThe situations in which classifiers may or must appear depend on the grammar of the language in question, but they are frequently required when a noun is accompanied by a numeral. They are therefore sometimes known (particularly in the context of languages such as Japanese) as counter words. They may also be used when a noun is accompanied by a demonstrative (a word such as \"this\" or \"that\").\n\nThe following examples, from Standard Mandarin Chinese, illustrate the use of classifiers with a numeral. The classifiers used here are 个 (traditional form 個, pinyin \"gè\"), used (among other things) with nouns for humans; 棵 \"kē\", used with nouns for trees; 只 (隻) \"zhī\", used with nouns for certain animals, including birds; and 条 (條) \"tiáo\", used with nouns for certain long flexible objects. (Plurals of Chinese nouns are not normally marked in any way; the same form of the noun is used for both singular and plural.)\n\nIn fact the first of these classifiers, 个 (個) \"gè\", is also often used in informal speech as a general classifier, with almost any noun, taking the place of more specific classifiers.\n\nThe noun in such phrases may be omitted, if the classifier alone (and the context) is sufficient to indicate what noun is intended. For example, in answering a question:\n\nLanguages which make systematic use of classifiers include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian languages, Bengali, Assamese, Persian, Austronesian languages, Mayan languages and others. A less typical example of classifiers is found in Southern Athabaskan.\n\nClassifier handshapes are found in sign languages, although these have a somewhat different grammatical function.\n\nClassifiers are often derived from nouns (or occasionally other parts of speech), which have become specialized as classifiers, or may retain other uses besides their use as classifiers. Classifiers, like other words, are sometimes borrowed from other languages. A language may be said to have dozens or even hundreds of different classifiers. However, such enumerations often also include measure words.\n\nMeasure words play a similar role to classifiers, except that they denote a particular quantity of something (a drop, a cupful, a pint, etc.), rather than the inherent countable units associated with a count noun. Classifiers are used with count nouns; measure words can be used with mass nouns (e.g. \"two pints of mud\"), and can also be used when a count noun's quantity is not described in terms of its inherent countable units (e.g. \"two pints of acorns\"). \n\nHowever, the terminological distinction between classifiers and measure words is often blurred – classifiers are commonly referred to as measure words in some contexts, such as Chinese language teaching, and measure words are sometimes called \"mass-classifiers\" or similar.\n\nClassifiers are not generally a feature of English or other European languages, although classifier-like constructions are found with certain nouns. A commonly cited English example is the word \"head\" in phrases such as \"five head of cattle\": the word \"cattle\" (for some speakers) is an uncountable (mass) noun, and requires the word \"head\" to enable its units to be counted. The parallel construction exists in French: \"une tête de bétail\" (\"one head of cattle\") and in Spanish: \"una cabeza de ganado\" (\"one head of cattle\"). Note the difference between \"five head of cattle\" (meaning five animals), and \"five heads of cattle\" (meaning specifically their heads). A similar phrase used by florists is \"ten stem of roses\" (meaning roses on their stems).\n\nEuropean languages naturally use measure words. These are required for counting in the case of mass nouns, and some can also be used with count nouns. For example, one can have a \"glass\" of beer, and a \"handful\" of coins. The English construction with \"of\" is paralleled in many languages, although in German (and similarly in Dutch and the Scandinavian languages) the two words are simply juxtaposed, e.g. one says \"ein Glas Bier\" (literally \"a glass beer\", with no word for \"of\"). Slavic languages put the second noun in the genitive case (e.g. Russian \"чаша пива (\"chasha piva), literally \"a glass beer's\"), but Bulgarian, having lost the Slavic case system, uses expressions identical to German (e.g. \"чаша пиво\").\n\nCertain nouns are associated with particular measure words or other classifier-like words that enable them to be counted. For example, \"paper\" is often counted in \"sheets\" as in \"five sheets of paper\". Usage or non-usage of measure words may yield different meanings, e.g. \"five papers\" is grammatically equally correct but refers to newspapers or academic papers. Some inherently plural nouns require the word \"pair\" (or its equivalent) to enable reference to a single object or specified number of objects, as in \"a pair of scissors\", \"three pair(s) of pants\", or the French \"une paire de lunettes\" (\"a pair of (eye)glasses\").\n\nAtypically for an Indo-European language, Bengali makes use of classifiers. Every noun in this language must have its corresponding classifier when used with a numeral or other quantifier. Most nouns take the generic classifier \"ṭa\", although there are many more specific measure words, such as \"jon\", which is only used to count humans. Still, there are many fewer measure words in Bengali than in Chinese or Japanese. As in Chinese, Bengali nouns are not inflected for number.\n\nSimilar to the situation in Chinese, measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. \"aṭ biṛal\" instead of \"aṭ-ṭa biṛal\" \"eight cats\") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, it is common to omit the classifier when it counts a noun that is not in the nominative case (e.g., \"aṭ biṛaler desh\" (eight cats-possessive country ), or \"panc bhUte khelo\" (five ghosts-instrumental ate)) or when the number is very large (e.g., \"ek sho lok esechhe\" (\"One hundred people have come.\")). Classifiers may also be dropped when the focus of the sentence is not on the actual counting but on a statement of fact (e.g., \"amar char chhele\" (I-possessive four boy, I have four sons)). The -ṭa suffix comes from /goṭa/ 'piece', and is also used as a definite article.\n\nOmitting the noun and preserving the classifier is grammatical and common. For example, \"Shudhu êk-jon thakbe.\" (lit. \"Only one-MW will remain.\") would be understood to mean \"Only one person will remain.\", since \"jon\" can only be used to count humans. The word \"lok\" \"person\" is implied.\n\nMaithili, Nepali and Assamese have systems very similar to Bengali's. Maithili uses \"-ta\" for objects and \"-goatey\" for humans; similarly, Nepali has \"-waṭā\" (-वटा) for objects and \"-janā\" (-जना) for humans. \n\nAssamese, Chittagonian, Sylheti and other Bengali-Assamese languages have more classifiers than Bengali. \n\nPersian (Farsi) has a scheme very similar to the Indo-Aryan languages Bengali, Assamese, Maithili and Nepali.\n\nIn Burmese, classifiers, in the form of particles, are used when counting or measuring nouns. They immediately follow the numerical quantification. Nouns to which classifiers refer can be omitted if the context allows, because many classifiers have implicit meanings.\n\nAlthough classifiers were not often used in Classical Chinese, in all modern Chinese varieties, such as Mandarin, nouns are normally required to be accompanied by a classifier or measure word when they are qualified by a numeral or by a demonstrative. Examples with numerals have been given above in the Overview section. An example with a demonstrative is 这个人 \"zhè ge rén\", meaning \"this person\", literally \"this [classifier] person\".\n\nThe noun in a classifier phrase may be omitted, if the context and choice of classifier make the intended noun obvious. An example of this again appears in the Overview section above.\n\nThe choice of a classifier for each noun is somewhat arbitrary and must be memorized by learners of Chinese, but often relates to the object's physical characteristics. For example, 張/张 \"zhāng\", one of whose meanings is \"table\", is used with many nouns denoting flat objects. Not all classifiers derive from nouns; for example, the word \"bǎ\" can also be a verb meaning \"to grab\", and is the classifier for objects that have handles.\n\nTechnically a distinction is made between classifiers (or \"count-classifiers\"), which are used only with count nouns and do not generally carry any meaning of their own, and measure words (or \"mass-classifiers\"), which can be used also with mass nouns and specify a particular quantity (such as \"bottle\" [of water] or \"pound\" [of fruit]). Less formally, however, the term \"measure word\" is used interchangeably with \"classifier\".\n\nIn Japanese grammar, classifiers must be used with a number when counting nouns. The appropriate classifier is chosen based on the kind and shape of the noun, and combines with the numeral, sometimes adopting several different forms.\n\nThe Korean language has classifiers in the form of suffixes which attach to numerals. For example, \"jang\" (장) is used to count sheets of paper, blankets, leaves, and other similar objects: \"ten bus tickets\" could be translated \"beoseu pyo yeol-jang\" (버스 표 열 장), literally \"bus ticket ten [classifier for sheets]\".\n\nIn Malay grammar, classifiers are used to count all nouns, including concrete nouns, abstract nouns and phrasal nouns. Nouns are not reduplicated for plural form when used with classifiers, definite or indefinite, although Mary Dalrymple and Suriel Mofu give counterexamples where reduplication and classifiers co-occur. In informal language, classifiers can be used with numbers alone without the nouns if the context is well known.\nThe Malay term for classifiers is \"penjodoh bilangan\".\n\nVietnamese uses a similar set of classifiers to Chinese, Japanese and Korean.\nKhmer (Cambodian) also uses classifiers, although they can quite frequently be omitted. Since it is a head-first language, the classifier phrase (number plus classifier) comes after the noun.\n\nIn American Sign Language classifier constructions are used to express position, stative description (size and shape), and how objects are handled manually. The particular hand shape used to express any of these constructions is what functions as the classifier. Various hand shapes can represent whole entities; show how objects are handled or instruments are used; represent limbs; and be used to express various characteristics of entities such as dimensions, shape, texture, position, and path and manner of motion. While the label of classifiers has been accepted by many sign language linguists, some argue that these constructions do not parallel oral-language classifiers in all respects and prefer to use other terms, such as polymorphemic or polycomponential signs.\n\nExamples:\n\nClassifiers are part of the grammar of most East Asian languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malay, Burmese, Thai, Hmong, and the Bengali and Munda languages just to the west of the East and Southeast Asia linguistic area. They are present in many Australian Aboriginal languages, including Yidiny and Murrinhpatha. Among indigenous languages of the Americas, classifiers are present in the Pacific Northwest, especially among the Tsimshianic languages, and in many languages of Mesoamerica, including Classic Maya and most of its modern derivatives. They also occur in some languages of the Amazon Basin (most famously Yagua) and a very small number of West African languages.\n\nIn contrast, classifiers are entirely absent not only from European languages, but also from many languages of northern Asia (Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic and mainland Paleosiberian languages), and also from the indigenous languages of the southern parts of both North and South America. In Austronesian languages, classifiers have been acquired as a result of contact with Mon–Khmer languages but the most remote members such as Malagasy and Hawaiian have lost them.\n\nThe \"World Atlas of Language Structures\" has a global map showing 400 languages and chapter text including geographical discussion:\n\nThe concept of noun classifier is distinct from that of noun class.\n\n\nNevertheless, there is no clearly demarked difference between the two: since classifiers often evolve into class systems, they are two extremes of a continuum.\n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic script is formed of a repertoire of hundreds of graphemes which play different semiotic roles. Almost every word ends with an unpronounced grapheme (the so-called “determinative”) that carries no additional phonetic value of its own. As such, this hieroglyph is a “mute” icon, which does not exist on the spoken level of language but supplies the word in question, through its iconic meaning alone, with extra semantic information.\n\nIn recent years, this system of unpronounced graphemes was compared to classifiers in spoken languages. The results show that the two systems, those of unpronounced graphemic classifiers and those of pronounced classifiers in classifier languages obey similar rules of use and function. The graphemic classifiers of the hieroglyphic script presents an emic image of knowledge organization in the Ancient Egyptian mind. \n\nSimilar graphemic classifiers are known also in Hieroglyphic Luwian and in \nChinese scripts.\n\n\n\n"}

The cocktail's origins can be traced to the United States in the 1890s, and the beverage remained widely popular in America until the 1970s. It was seen as a drink of the upper class, and has had a somewhat wide cultural impact.\n\nThe Stinger originated about 1890. The cocktail may have been derived from The Judge, a cocktail made with brandy, crème de menthe, and simple syrup found in William Schmidt's 1892 cocktail book \"The Flowing Bowl\". It was immediately popular in New York City, and quickly became known as a \"society\" drink (i.e. only for the upper-classes). According to bartender Jere Sullivan in his 1930 volume \"The Drinks of Yesteryear: A Mixology\", the Stinger remained a critical component of the bartender's repertoire until Prohibition. \n\nThe Stinger was not initially seen as a cocktail (i.e. a drink served before dinner), but rather a digestif (after-dinner drink). Writing in the 1910s and 1920s, humorist Don Marquis's \"Hermione\" (a fictional daffy society do-gooder) refused to refer to the Stinger as a cocktail, indicating its status in upper-class society. Over time, however, the Stinger came to be consumed like a cocktail.\n\nThe Stinger was a popular drink during American Prohibition, for crème de menthe could mask the taste of the inferior-quality brandies then available. The Stinger began to lose favor with Americans in the late 1970s, and was not a well-known cocktail in the early 21st century.\n\nThe Stinger is a duo cocktail, in that it uses only two ingredients: a spirit and a liqueur. The classic Stinger recipe uses three parts brandy and one part white crème de menthe. However, Stinger recipes vary, and some recipes call for equal parts brandy and crème de menthe. The mixture was originally stirred, although modern recipes call for it to be shaken with cracked ice. Early recipes required that the Stinger be served straight, but since the end of Prohibition in the United States it became more common for it to be served over crushed ice. \n\nCognac, a type of brandy, was the identified as the basis for the Stinger as early as William \"Cocktail\" Boothby's 1905 supplement to his 1900 book, \"American Bar-Tender\". In the 21st century, cognac was the most commonly used brandy cited by recipes for the Stinger's base liquor.\n\nCocktail guides recommend that it be served in a cocktail glass if served straight, or in a rocks glass if served with ice.\n\nThe Amaretto Stinger uses a 3-to-1 ratio of amaretto to white crème de menthe, while an Irish Stinger uses equal parts Irish cream liqueur and white crème de menthe.\n\nThe Mexican Stinger substitutes tequila for brandy. A \"Vodka Stinger\", also known as a White Spider, uses vodka instead of brandy.\n\nA White Way Cocktail, which celebrates Broadway theatre, is a Stinger made with gin rather than brandy.\n\nMixologists Oliver Said and James Mellgren cite a cocktail known as the Stinger Sour. It is made with a 3-to-1-to-1 ratio of bourbon, peppermint schnapps, and lemon juice. This cocktail is not technically a Stinger, since it omits the crème de menthe.\n\nThe Stinger's popularity in New York City was so great that urban legends attributed the cocktail's genesis to famous millionaire Reginald Vanderbilt. It was further claimed that the Stinger was Vanderbilt's favorite cocktail, and he spent hours making them for his guests.\n\nThe Stinger's reputation as a high-society drink led to its appearance in several famous novels. James Bond and Tiffany Case each have a Stinger in the 1956 Ian Fleming novel \"Diamonds are Forever\". The spy Alec Leamas drinks Stingers in John le Carré's 1963 novel \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\".\n\nThe Vodka Stinger was the drink of choice for Joanne in the play \"Company\" by Stephen Sondheim, with her calling for one in the song \"The Ladies Who Lunch\".\n\nThe drink is also featured in the 2007 \"Mad Men\" season one episode \"Nixon v. Kennedy\", set in 1960. The episode features Stingers made with Bacardi rum, as Bacardi was a series sponsor.\n\nThe Stinger was widely mentioned in American motion pictures. Dudley the angel orders a round of Stingers while lunching with ladies from the church in the 1947 film \"The Bishop's Wife\". The evolving Stinger (used with green rather than white crème de menthe) forms a plot point in the 1948 film \"The Big Clock\", when George Stroud (Ray Milland) orders one and a random woman in the bar (Rita Johnson) already knows his name. In the 1956 Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra film \"High Society\", Dexter-Haven's butler offers Stingers at lunch to those who over-indulged in champagne during the previous evening's party. Cary Grant again orders Stingers (\"and keep them coming\") as he tries to tolerate character Alice Kratzner's (Jayne Mansfield) empty-headed babbling in the 1957 comedy film \"Kiss Them for Me\". Mr. Dobitsch (Ray Walston) instructs his Marilyn Monroe look-alike date (Joyce Jameson) in the 1960 film \"The Apartment\" to not spill the glasses of Stingers she is holding as they exit their cab and enter C.C. Baxter's (Jack Lemmon) apartment at night for a tryst.\nIn the 1975 Warren Beatty film Shampoo, at the Republican Party dinner scene Goldie Hawn says, \"I'll have a stinger.\" To which Tony Bill replies, \"Before dinner?\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1142338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1142338", "title": "Pisco sour", "text": "Pisco sour\n\nA pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is typical of the cuisines from Chile and Peru. The drink's name comes from \"pisco\", which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term \"sour\", in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian \"pisco\" as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean \"pisco\" and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.\n\nAlthough the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.\n\nIn Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath attributed the invention of the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named \"Sunshine\", who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of the whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.\n\nCocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a South American classic. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their national drink, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.\n\nThe term \"sour\" refers to mixed drinks containing a base liquor (bourbon or some other whiskey), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener. \"Pisco\" refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of Pisco. In the book \"Latin America and the Caribbean\", historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early Colonial Peru and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the Andes. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of Ica to establish distilleries \"to make wine into brandy\", and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.\n\nThe first grapevines were brought to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain in the 16th century. Spanish chroniclers from the time note the first winemaking in South America took place in the \"hacienda\" Marcahuasi of Cuzco. The largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted vineyards in Peru. Carabantes also established vineyards in Ica, from where Spaniards from Andalucia and Extremadura introduced grapevines into Chile.\n\nAlready in the 16th century, Spanish settlers in Chile and Peru began producing aguardiente distilled from fermented grapes. Since at least 1764, Peruvian aguardiente was called \"pisco\" after its port of shipping; the usage of the name \"pisco\" for aguardiente then spread to Chile. The right to produce and market pisco, still made in Peru and Chile, is the subject of ongoing disputes between the two countries.\n\nAccording to historian Luciano Revoredo, the preparation of pisco with lemon dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the \"Mercurio Peruano\" which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's \"Plaza de toros de Acho\", the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named \"Punche\" (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian Pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook \"Manual de Cocina a la Criolla\"; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that \"[i]t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook.\"\n\nThe pisco sour originated in Lima, Peru. It was created by bartender Victor Vaughen Morris, an American who had moved to Peru in 1904 to work in a railway company in Cerro de Pasco. Morris relocated to Lima in 1915 and, a year later, opened a saloon—Morris' Bar—which became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the pisco sour's invention to \"Gringo\" Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris. Morris often experimented with new drinks, and developed the pisco sour as a variety of the whiskey Sour.\n\nSome discrepancy exists on the exact date when Morris created the popular cocktail. Mixologist Dale DeGroff asserts the drink was invented in 1915, but other sources argue this happened in the 1920s. The Chilean web newspaper \"El Mercurio Online\" specifically contends historians attribute the year of the drink's invention as 1922, adding that \"one night Morris surprised his friends with a new drink he called \"pisco sour\", a formula which mixes the Peruvian \"pisco\" with the American \"sour\"\" (in Spanish: \"\"Una noche Morris sorprendió a sus amigos con una nueva bebida a la que llamó pisco sour, una fórmula que funde lo peruano del pisco con el 'sour' estadounidense.\"\").\n\nThe pisco sour's initial recipe was that of a simple cocktail. According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, \"it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days.\" As the cocktail's recipe continued to evolve, the bar's registry shows that customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink. The modern Peruvian version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from Chincha Alta who worked under the apprenticeship of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget's recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. Journalist Erica Duecy writes that Bruiget's innovation added \"a silky texture and frothy head\" to the cocktail.\n\nMorris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention. The oldest known mention of the pisco sour appears in the September 1920 edition of the Peruvian magazine \"Hogar\". Another old advertisement appears in the April 22, 1921, edition of the Peruvian magazine \"Mundial\". In the magazine, not only is the pisco sour described as a white-colored beverage, but its invention is attributed to \"Mister Morris.\" Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris' friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in Valparaíso, Chile. The advertisement featured in the Valparaíso newspaper \"South Pacific Mail\", owned by Rounsevell. By 1927, Morris' Bar had attained widespread notability for its cocktails, particularly the pisco sour. Brad Thomas Parsons writes that \"the registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink.\"\n\nOver time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bolívar and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of cirrhosis.\n\nHistorian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris closed his bar, some of his bartenders left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found work elsewhere, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars as far north as the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.\n\nBeatriz Jiménez, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper \"El Mundo\", indicates that back in Peru, the luxury hotels of Lima adopted the pisco sour as their own in the 1940s. An oil bonanza attracted foreign attention to Peru during the 1940s and 1950s. Among the visitors to Lima were renowned Hollywood actors who were fascinated by the pisco sour. Jiménez recollected oral traditions claiming an inebriated Ava Gardner had to be carried away by John Wayne after drinking too many pisco sours. Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles are said to have been big fans of what they described as \"that Peruvian drink.\"\n\nIn 1984, Bolivian journalist Ted Córdova Claure writes that the Hotel Bolívar stood as a monument to the decadence of the Peruvian oligarchy (in Spanish: \"\"Este hotel es un monumento a la decadencia de la oligarquía peruana.\"\"). He noted the locale as being the traditional home of the pisco sour and recommended it as one of the best hotels in Lima. Nowadays, the Hotel Bolivar continues to offer the cocktail in its \"El Bolivarcito\" bar, while the Country Club Lima Hotel offers the drink in its \"English Bar\" saloon.\n\nVictor Vaughen Morris is considered by most historians to be the inventor of the cocktail. Despite this, there exists an ongoing dispute between Chile and Peru over the origin of the pisco sour. In Chile, a local story developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the pisco sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a sailing ship named \"Sunshine\". Chilean folklorist and historian Oreste Plath contributed to the legend's propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper \"El Comercio de Iquique\", in 1872, after obtaining leave to disembark, Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of Iquique and invented the pisco sour while experimenting with drinks.\n\nNevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues that the story was refuted after it was discovered \"El Comercio de Iquique\" was actually referring to the invention of the whiskey sour. This claim is further certified by the University of Cuyo, Argentina, which in 1962 published the story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the whiskey sour in Iquique. An excerpt from the newspaper's story has Elliot Stubb stating, \"From now on ... this shall be my drink of battle, my favorite drink, and it shall be named Whisky Sour\" (in Spanish: \"\"En adelante dijo Elliot — éste será mi trago de batalla, — mi trago favorito —, y se llamará Whisky Sour.\"\").\n\nThe pisco sour has three different methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Peruvian pisco with Key lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with Pica lime juice, powdered sugar, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions \"is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not.\" The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its \"New Era Drinks,\" is similar to the Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.\n\nConsiderable variations exist in the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas \"Chilean pisco is mass-produced\", the Peruvian version \"is made in small batches.\" Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that \"[i]n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it is very similar to grappa. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac.\" Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their vintage year and the Chilean versions do not.\n\nVariations of the pisco sour exist in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as \"maracuya\", \"aguaymanto\", and apples, or traditional ingredients such as the coca leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice.\n\nCocktails similar to the pisco sour include the Chilean Piscola and the Peruvian Algarrobina Cocktail. Piscola is made by mixing pisco with cola. The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, condensed milk, and sap from the Peruvian \"algarroba\" tree. Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.\n\nDuggan McDonnell describes the pisco sour as \"Latin America's most elegant cocktail, frothy, balanced, bright yet rich,\" adding that \"Barkeeps throughout Northern California will attest that they have shaken many a Pisco sour. It is the egg white cocktail of choice and an absolutely beloved one by most.\" Australian journalist Kate Schneider writes that the pisco sour \"has become so famous that there is an International Pisco Sour Day celebration on the first Saturday in February every year, as well as a Facebook page with more than 600,000 likes.\" According to Chilean entrepreneur Rolando Hinrichs Oyarce, owner of a restaurant-bar in Spain, \"The pisco sour is highly international, just like Cebiche, and so they are not too unknown\" (Spanish: \"\"El pisco sour es bastante internacional, al igual que el cebiche, por lo tanto no son tan desconocidos\"\"). In 2003, Peru created the \"\"Día Nacional del Pisco Sour\"\" (National Pisco Sour Day), an official government holiday celebrated on the first Saturday of February.\n\nDuring the 2008 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Peru promoted its pisco sour with widespread acceptance. The cocktail was reportedly the preferred drink of the attendees, mostly leaders, businessmen, and delegates. American celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain also drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his Travel Channel program \"\", he drank a pisco sour in Valparaíso, Chile, and said \"that's good, but ... next time, I'll have a beer.\" The broadcaster Radio Programas del Perú reported that Jorge López Sotomayor, the episode's Chilean producer and Bourdain's travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the pisco sour he drank in Valparaíso as boring and worthless (in Spanish: \"\"A mí me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontró aburrido y que no valía la pena.\"\"). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.\n\nIn Mexico, singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek humorously posted on Twitter that the pisco sour is Chilean and, after receiving critical responses to his statement, apologized and mentioned he was only joking. Mexican television host and comedian Adal Ramones also joked about pisco sour, in reference to the 2009 Chile–Peru espionage scandal, on November 17, 2009.

It is filled with savory ingredients, most often minced meat or fish, and is served as an entrée, main course, or side dish. Rissoles originated in Portugal.\n\nIn Portugal, rissoles are known as rissóis (singular \"rissol\") and are a very popular snack that can be found in many cafes, barbecues and house parties. Rissóis are a breaded pastry shaped as half-moon, usually filled with fish or shrimp in Béchamel sauce and then deep fried. Minced meat is often used too. Other usual fills include shrimp and cod. Other variations use chicken or a combination of cheese and ham as a filling. Rissóis are usually eaten cold, as a snack or as an appetizer, but can also be a main course, usually served with rice or salad.\n\nFried rissoles are common in the Republic of Ireland, especially in the county of Wexford, where boiled potatoes are mashed, mixed with herbs and spices, battered or breadcrumbed, and served with chips, chicken or battered sausages.\n\nRissoles are sold in chip shops in south Wales, north-east England and Yorkshire. Rissoles and chips is a common choice of meal. These rissoles are meat (typically beef), or fish in Yorkshire, mashed up with potato, herbs and sometimes onion. They are coated in breadcrumbs or less frequently battered and deep fried.\n\nIn Poland, rissoles are known as sznycle (singular \"sznycel\") and are very common in canteens, especially in schools. Eaten hot as the main part of the main course, sznycle are usually served with boiled potatoes (sometimes mashed) and vegetables. The stuffing is always minced meat. Other variations use chicken or a combination of cheese and ham as a filling. In some regions where the name denotes a Wiener schnitzel, the term kotlet siekany (literally: \"chopped cutlet\") is used instead.\n\nIn France, rissoles are served as a dessert cooked in the Savoy region. They are made of pears in batter and are baked, not fried.\n\nIn Brazil, they are often filled with heart of palm, cheese, ham, ground meat, chicken or shrimp.\n\nThis form of rissole is very similar to a burger patty and is made from minced meat without a pastry covering, resembling an irregular meatball. An Australian rissole usually contains more ingredients than a burger, almost always using breadcrumbs but many Australians have their own family recipe which may also include onion, finely grated herbs and vegetables, sauces, salt, and spices. Rissoles are usually made from beef, chicken or lamb. Basing the rissoles on ingredients such as tuna, and pumpkin is also possible. They are cooked in a pan or on a barbecue, and are usually eaten hot as part of a meal. Australian rissoles are not usually eaten hot between bread with salad or cheese. If they are they will usually be called burgers (despite differences between the two types of patty) however cold rissoles are frequently eaten as a sandwich filling the next day.\n\nThe Australian Rissole became popular during both World Wars as a means of stretching meat rationing set by the Australian government. Rissoles were made by butchers and housewives to use off cuts of meat, then finely minced with the adding of left over bread crumbs, abundant flour, eggs and vegetables/herbs to improve the flavour. The Australian Rissole has evolved over the past 100 years with most Australian Families having special recipes and secret ingredients including; beer, Vegemite, peanut butter, Cornflakes, Carrot, Chili and a spices from all over the world.\n\nRissole is a snack food in Indonesia, where they are called risoles (pronounced 'riss-ol-less'). The skin is made from batter in the same fashion as a flat crepes. They are commonly filled with bechamel, chicken, and diced vegetables - including carrot, celery, common beans and potato. The filling is wrapped inside the skin, then the package is rolled upon breadcrumbs and fried in ample amounts of hot cooking oil. It is eaten with bird's eye chili, chilli sauce, mayonnaise or mustard.\n\n"}
{"id": "1148726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1148726", "title": "Stollen", "text": "Stollen\n\nStollen ( or ) is a fruit bread of nuts, spices, and dried or candied fruit, coated with powdered sugar or icing sugar. It is a traditional German bread eaten during the Christmas season, when it is called Weihnachtsstollen (after \"Weihnachten\", the German word for Christmas) or Christstollen (after Christ).\n\nStollen is a cake-like fruit bread made with yeast, water and flour, and usually with zest added to the dough. Orangeat (candied orange peel) and candied citrus peel (Zitronat), raisins and almonds, and various spices such as cardamom and cinnamon are added. Other ingredients, such as milk, sugar, butter, salt, rum, eggs, vanilla, other dried fruits and nuts and marzipan, may also be added to the dough.\nExcept for the fruit added, the dough is quite low in sugar. The finished bread is sprinkled with icing sugar. The traditional weight of Stollen is around , but smaller sizes are common. The bread is slathered with melted unsalted butter and rolled in sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven, resulting in a moister product that keeps better. The marzipan rope in the middle is optional. The dried fruits are macerated in rum or brandy for a superior-tasting bread.\n\nDresden Stollen (originally Striezel), a moist, heavy bread filled with fruit, was first mentioned in an official document in 1474, and \"Dresdner Stollen\" remains notable and available – amongst other places – at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt.\nDresden Stollen is produced in the city of Dresden and distinguished by a special seal depicting King Augustus II the Strong. This \"official\" Stollen is produced by only 150 Dresden bakers.\n\nEarly Stollen was different, with the ingredients being flour, oats and water. As a Christmas bread stollen was baked for the first time at the Council of Trent in 1545, and was made with flour, yeast, oil and water.\n\nThe Advent season was a time of fasting, and bakers were not allowed to use butter, only oil, and the cake was tasteless and hard. In the 15th century, in medieval Saxony (in central Germany, north of Bavaria and south of Brandenburg), the Prince Elector Ernst (1441–1486) and his brother Duke Albrecht (1443–1500) decided to remedy this by writing to the Pope in Rome. The Saxon bakers needed to use butter, as oil in Saxony was expensive, hard to come by, and had to be made from turnips.\n\nPope Nicholas V (1397–1455), in 1450 denied the first appeal. Five popes died before finally, in 1490, Pope Innocent VIII (1432–1492) sent a letter, known as the \"Butter-Letter\", to the Prince. This granted the use of butter (without having to pay a fine), but only for the Prince-Elector and his family and household.\n\nOthers were also permitted to use butter, but on the condition of having to pay annually 1/20th of a gold Gulden to support the building of the Freiberg Minster. The ban on butter was removed when Saxony became Protestant.\n\nOver the centuries, the bread changed from being a simple, fairly tasteless \"bread\" to a sweeter bread with richer ingredients, such as marzipan, although traditional Stollen is not as sweet, light and airy as the copies made around the world.\n\nCommercially made Stollen has become a popular Christmas food in Britain in recent decades, complementing traditional dishes such as mince pies and Christmas pudding. All the major supermarkets sell their own versions, and it is often baked by home bakers. \n\nEvery year Stollenfest takes place in Dresden. This historical tradition ended only in 1918 with the fall of the monarchy, and started again in 1994, but the idea comes from Dresden’s history.\n\nDresden’s Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt, was mentioned in the chronicles for the first time in 1474.\n\nThe tradition of baking Christmas Stollen in Dresden is very old. Christmas Stollen in Dresden was already baked in the 15th century.\n\nIn 1560, the bakers of Dresden offered the rulers of Saxony Christmas Stollen weighing each as gift, and the custom continued.\n\nAugustus II the Strong (1670–1733) was the Elector of Saxony, King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania.\nThe King loved pomp, luxury, splendour and feasts. In 1730, he impressed his subjects, ordering the Bakers’ Guild of Dresden to make a giant 1.7-tonne Stollen, big enough for everyone to have a portion to eat. There were around 24,000 guests who were taking part in the festivities on the occasion of the legendary amusement festivity known as Zeithainer Lustlager. For this special occasion, the court architect Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann (1662–1737), built a particularly oversized Stollen oven. An oversized Stollen knife also had been designed solely for this occasion.\n\nToday, the festival takes place on the Saturday before the second Sunday in Advent, and the cake weighs between three and four tonnes. A carriage takes the cake in a parade through the streets of Dresden to the Christmas market, where it is ceremoniously cut into pieces and distributed among the crowd, for a small sum which goes to charity. A special knife, the Grand Dresden Stollen Knife, a silver-plated knife, long weighing , which is a copy of the lost baroque original knife from 1730, is used to festively cut the oversize Stollen at the Dresden Christmas fair.\nThe largest Stollen was baked in 2010 by Lidl; it was long and was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records, at the railway station of Haarlem.\n\n"}
{"id": "1148978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1148978", "title": "German chocolate cake", "text": "German chocolate cake\n\nGerman chocolate cake, originally German's chocolate cake, is a layered chocolate cake from the United States filled and topped with a coconut-pecan frosting. It owes its name to an English-American chocolate maker named Samuel German, who developed a formulation of dark baking chocolate that came to be used in the cake recipe. Sweet baking chocolate is traditionally used for the chocolate flavor in the actual cake, but few recipes call for it today. The filling and/or topping is a custard made with egg yolks and evaporated milk; once the custard is cooked, coconut and pecans are stirred in. Occasionally, a chocolate frosting is spread on the sides of the cake and piped around the circumference of the layers to hold in the filling. Maraschino cherries are occasionally added as a garnish.\n\nIts roots can be traced back to 1852 when American baker Samuel German developed a type of dark baking chocolate for the Baker's Chocolate Company. The brand name of the product, \"Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate\", was named in honor of him.\n\nOn June 3, 1957, a recipe for \"German's Chocolate Cake\" appeared as the \"Recipe of the Day\" in \"The Dallas Morning News\". It was created by Mrs. George Clay, a homemaker from 3831 Academy Drive, Dallas, Texas. This recipe used the baking chocolate introduced 105 years prior and became quite popular. General Foods, which owned the Baker's brand at the time, took notice and distributed the cake recipe to other newspapers in the country. Sales of Baker's Chocolate are said to have increased by as much as 73% and the cake would become a national staple. The possessive form (German's) was dropped in subsequent publications, forming the \"German Chocolate Cake\" identity and giving the false impression of a German origin.\n\nThe recipe still remains popular to this day and has been adopted by baking companies.\n\nJune 11 is National German Chocolate Cake Day in America.\n\n"}

The peasants knew in advance how much produce they would have to surrender to the state. The rate of prodnalog was much smaller than prodrazvyorstka. For comparison, in 1920-1921 the peasants surrendered to the state 367 million \"poods\" (6,010,000 metric tons) of cereals through prodrazvyorstka, as opposed to 240 million poods (3,930,000 metric tons) in 1921-1922 through prodnalog.\n\nDuring the first year of introduction of prodnalog, a significant amount of bread and other products remained at peasant households' disposal, which provided an incentive for peasants to develop their own household economy, widen the sowing areas, increase the total number of livestock and productivity of crops. The rate of prodnalog on each kind of agricultural product was determined depending on local conditions and prosperity of a given peasant household. The Soviet state adhered to a policy of progressive taxation; the highest rate of prodnalog had to be paid by the kulak households.\n\nIn March and April 1921, a number of Soviet Decrees introduced a natural tax on bread, potato, oilseeds, eggs, dairy products, wool, hides, flax and hemp linen, tobacco etc. The collection of agricultural goods in excess of prodnalog, if necessary, was intended to be made on a barter basis by giving peasants manufactured goods. In order to accelerate the expansion of commodity circulation, create necessary conditions for developing farming and industry and speed up the productive forces of the country, the government encouraged small-scale production all over Soviet Union. The introduction of prodnalog revived the trade and created a different kind of relations between the city and the village. \nBy the decision of the 12th Congress of the RCP(b) (April 1923), prodnalog and other taxes in the rural areas were exchanged for a universal direct agricultural tax (decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom on May 10, 1923). The latter would be collected in monetary form starting in 1924, with the establishment of hard currency in the USSR.\n\n"}

The main ingredients are mangoes, \"aavapindi\" (powdered mustard seeds) and a combination of other spices used for pickling. South Indians are known to have a deep attachment to these spicy pickles. A wide variety of pickles are available in these regions, using mango as their prime ingredient. Besides being made at home, the pickles are available commercially and are exported to the United States, Europe, Japan and many other countries.\n\nAavakaaya pickles are usually made in the summer, this being the time for peak availability of green mangoes. Green mangoes, hot oil, chillies and a variety of spices are the key ingredients. The process of preparation, storage and serving is considered almost a ritual.\n\nThe mangoes are cut into medium-sized pieces approximately 2 cm x 2 cm using strong and especially sharp cutters/knives in swift strokes so as not to structurally damage the pieces. These pieces are wiped clean and dry with a highly-absorbent soft cloth — usually an old sterilized cotton sari with no embroidery, stowed away for this purpose. They are then pickled with powdered mustard, red chili powder (dried and powdered or sometimes dried, roasted and powdered), salt, gingelly oil and fenugreek (both in whole and powder form). Garlic is optional. The mixture matures for four to eight weeks, care being taken to mix the contents periodically to ensure a uniform marinade.\n\nAavakai (Tamil version) is prepared during the pre-Summer seasons when mangoes are just about to ripen. The Tamil version, is not as spicy as the Andhra version and often contains chickpeas as one of the primary ingredients. It is prepared in many households and eaten along with curd rice.\n\nAavakaaya is very popular in South India, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThere is a wide variety of mango pickles, these include:\n\n\nHot rice is mixed with one or two pieces of aavakaaya and ghee (clarified butter) or groundnut oil, then made into bite-size balls. Aavakaaya is often eaten with rice and dahi (yogurt). Raw onion can be added which enhances the taste. Most people prefer to eat it along with muddapappu (pigeon pea dal) and neyyi (ghee/clarified Butter). Some people prefer to eat it within 1–2 months from preparation, when it is called \"Kottaavakaya\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1151989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1151989", "title": "Tableware", "text": "Tableware\n\nTableware are the dishes or dishware used for setting a table, serving food and dining. It includes cutlery, glassware, serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes. The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, cuisine and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.\n\n\"Dinnerware\" is another term used to refer to tableware and \"crockery\" refers to porcelain and bone china produced by makers such as Sèvres in France, Meissen in Germany, Royal Copenhagen in Denmark, Royal Doulton in England, or Belleek Pottery in Northern Ireland. Sets of dishes are referred to as a table service, dinner service or service set. Table settings or place settings are the dishes, cutlery and glassware used for formal and informal dining. In Ireland such items are normally referred to as \"delph\", the word being an English language phonetic spelling of the word \"delft\", the town from which so much delftware came. Silver service or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal.\n\nSetting the table refers to arranging the tableware, including individual place settings for each diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion. Tableware and table decoration is typically more elaborate for special occasions. Unusual dining locations demand tableware be adapted.\n\nDishes are usually made of ceramic materials such as earthenware, stoneware, faience, bone china or porcelain. However, they can be made of other materials such as wood, pewter, silver, gold, glass, acrylic and plastic. Before it was possible to purchase mass-produced tableware, it was fashioned from available materials, such as wood. Industrialisation and developments in ceramic manufacture made inexpensive washable tableware available. It is sold either by the piece or as a matched set for a number of diners, normally four, six, eight, or twelve place settings. Large quantities are purchased for use in restaurants. Individual pieces, such as those needed as replacement pieces for broken dishes, can be procured from \"open stock\" inventory at shops, or from antique dealers if the pattern is no longer in production.\n\nPossession of tableware has to a large extent been determined by individual wealth; the greater the means, the higher was the quality of tableware that was owned and the more numerous its pieces. In the London of the 13th century, the more affluent citizens owned fine furniture and silver, \"while those of straiter means possessed only the simplest pottery and kitchen utensils.\" By the later 16th century, \"even the poorer citizens dined off pewter rather than wood\" and had plate, jars and pots made from \"green glazed earthenware\". The nobility often used their arms on heraldic china.\n\nTableware is generally the functional part of the settings on dining tables but great attention has been paid to the purely decorative aspects, especially when dining is regarded as part of entertainment such as in banquets given by important people or special events, such as State occasions. Table decoration may be ephemeral and consist of items made from confectionery or wax - substances commonly employed in Roman banqueting tables of the 17th century. During the reign of George III of the United Kingdom, ephemeral table decoration was done by men known as \"table-deckers\" who used sand and similar substances to create marmotinto works (sand painting) for single-use decoration. In modern times, ephemeral table decorations continue to be made from sugar or carved from ice.\n\nIn wealthy countries such as 17th century France, table decorations for the aristocracy were sometimes made of silver. One of the most famous table decorations is the \"Cellini Salt Cellar\". Ephemeral and silver table decorations were replaced with porcelain items after its reinvention in Europe in the 16th century.\n\nA table setting in Western countries is mainly in one of two styles: \"service à la russe\" (French for \"in the Russian style\"), where each course of the meal is brought out in specific order; and \"service à la française\" (French for \"in the French style\"), where all the courses for the meal are arranged on the table and presented at the same time that guests are seated. \"Service à la russe\" has become the custom in most restaurants, whereas \"service à la française\" is the norm in family settings.\n\nPlace settings for \"service à la russe\" dining are arranged according to the number of courses in the meal. The tableware is arranged in a particular order. With the first course, each guest at the table begins by using the tableware placed on the outside of place setting. As each course is finished the guest leaves the used cutlery on the used plate or bowl, which are removed from the table by the server. In some case, the original set is kept for the next course. To begin the next course, the diner uses the next item on the outside of the place setting, and so on. Forks are placed on the left of a dinner plate, knives to the right of the plate, and spoons to the outer right side of the place setting.\n\nItems of tableware include a variety of plates, bowls; or cups for individual diners and a range of serving dishes to transport the food from the kitchen or to separate smaller dishes. Plates include charger plates as well as specific dinner plates, lunch plates, dessert plates, salad plates or side plates. Bowls include those used for soup, cereal, pasta, fruit or dessert. A range of saucers accompany plates and bowls, those designed to go with teacups, coffee cups, demitasses and cream soup bowls. There are also individual covered casserole dishes.\n\nDishes come in standard sizes, which are set according to the manufacturer. They are similar throughout the industry. Plates are standardised in descending order of diameter size according to function. One standard series is charger (12 inches); dinner plate (10.5 inches); dessert plate (8.5 inches) salad plate (7.5 inches); side plate, tea plate (6.75 inches).\n\nGlasses and mugs of various types are an important part of tableware, as beverages are important parts of a meal. Vessels to hold alcoholic beverages such as wine, whether red, white, sparkling tend to be quite specialised in form, with for example Port wine glasses, beer glasses, brandy balloons, aperitif and liqueur glasses all having different shapes. Water glasses, juice glasses and hot chocolate mugs are also differentiated. Their appearance as part of the tableware depends on the meal and the style of table arrangement.\n\nTea and coffee tend to involve strong social rituals and so teacups and, coffee cups (including demitasse cups) have a shape that depends on the culture and the social situation in which the drink is taken.\n\nCutlery is an important part of tableware. A basic formal place setting will usually have a dinner plate at the centre, resting on a charger. The rest of the place setting depends upon the first course, which may be soup, salad or fish.\n\nIn either arrangement, the napkin may either rest folded underneath the forks, or it may be folded and placed on the dinner plate.\n\nWhen more courses are being served, place settings may become more elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and pastry fork. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table.\n\nA wide range of serving dishes are used to transport food from kitchen to table or to serve it at table, in order to make food service easier and cleaner or more efficient and pleasant. Serving dishes include: butter dishes; casseroles; fruit bowls; ramekins or lidded serving bowls; compotes; pitchers or jugs; platters, salvers, and trays; salt and pepper shakers or salt cellars; sauce or gravy boats; tureens and tajines; vegetable or salad bowls.\n\nA range of items specific to the serving of tea or coffee also have long cultural traditions. They include teapots and coffee pots as well as samovars, sugar bowls; milk or cream jugs.\n\nPlace markers are used to designate assigned seats to guests. They are typically used at large formal functions such as weddings, banquets for dignitaries, politicians or diplomats as well as on special occasions such as large children's parties. Some are collectible\n\nChinese table settings are traditional in style. Table setting practices in Japan and other parts of East Asia have been influenced by Chinese table setting customs. The emphasis in Chinese table settings is on displaying each individual food in a pleasing way, usually in separate bowls or dishes. Formal table settings are based upon the arrangements used in a family setting, although they can become extremely elaborate with many dishes. Serving bowls and dishes are brought to the table, where guests can choose their own portions. Formal Chinese restaurants often use a large turning wheel in the centre of the table to rotate food for easier service.\n\nIn a family setting, a meal typically includes a \"fan\" dish, which constitutes the meal's base (much like bread forms the base of various sandwiches), and several accompanying mains, called \"cai\" dish (\"choi\" or \"seoung\" in Cantonese). More specifically, \"fan\" usually refers to cooked rice, but can also be other staple grain-based foods. If the meal is a light meal, it will typically include the base and one main dish. The base is often served directly to the guest in a bowl, whereas main dishes are chosen by the guest from shared serving dishes on the table.\n\nAn \"elaborate\" formal meal would include the following place setting:\n\nJapanese ceramic tableware is an industry that is many centuries old. Unlike in Western cultures, where tableware is often produced and bought in matching sets, Japanese tableware is set on the table so that each dish complements the type of food served in it. Since Japanese meals normally include several small amounts of each food per person, this means that each person has a place setting with several different small dishes and bowls for holding individual food and condiments. The emphasis in a Japanese table setting is on enhancing the appearance of the food, which is partially achieved by showing contrasts between the items. Each bowl and dish may have a different shape, colour or pattern.\n\nA basic complete place setting for one person in Japan would include the following:\n\nNot all of these plates and bowls would be necessary for one meal. A rice bowl, a soup bowl, two or three small dishes with accompanying foods, and two or three condiment dishes for person would be typical. Various serving bowls and platters would also be set on a table for a typical meal, along with a soy sauce cruet, a small pitcher for tempura or other sauce, and a tea setting of tea pot, tea cups and tea cup saucers.\n\nTableware for special circumstances has to be adapted. Dining in the outdoors, for example, whether for recreational purposes, as on a picnic or as part of a journey, project or mission requires specialised tableware. It must be portable, more robust and if possible, lighter in weight than tableware used indoors. It is usually carefully packed for transportation to the place where it will be used.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1152459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1152459", "title": "Tsampa", "text": "Tsampa\n\nTsampa or Tsamba (; ; ) is a Tibetan and Himalayan staple foodstuff, particularly prominent in the central part of the region. It is roasted flour, usually barley flour and sometimes also wheat flour. It is usually mixed with the salty Tibetan butter tea. It is also eaten in Turkestan and Mongolia, where it is known as zamba.\n\n\"Tsampa\" is quite simple to prepare; indeed, it is known as a convenience food and often used by the Sherpas, nomads and other travellers. While traditional tsampa is prepared with tea, sometimes water or beer is used in its place. It may also be prepared as a porridge. André Migot described its preparation:\nBesides constituting a substantial, arguably predominant part of the Tibetan diet, its prominence also derives from the tradition of throwing pinches of \"tsampa\" in the air during many Buddhist rituals. It is believed that \"tsampa\"-throwing actually predates Buddhist beliefs in the area and was originally used as an offering to animistic gods to request their protection. The tradition was consequently incorporated into Buddhism as a \"mark of joy and celebration\" used at celebratory occasions such as marriages and birthdays. Today it is particularly known in that regard for its use in New Year celebrations, where it is accompanied by chanted verses expressing the desire for good luck in the forthcoming year, for both oneself and others. \"Tsampa\"-throwing also occurs at most Buddhist funerals, where the action is intended to release the soul of the deceased.\n\n\"Tsampa\" is used in a number of other ways. Mashes of \"tsampa\" and cumin are sometimes applied to toothaches or other sore spots. \"Tsampa\" is also known among Tibetan sportsmen for its ability to provide rapid energy boosts; the roasting of the flour breaks it down to an easily digestible state, allowing the calories therein to be quickly incorporated by the body.\n\nReflecting its foundational role in Tibetan culture, \"Tsampa\" is also the name of a Tibetan typeface.\n\nThe phrase \"\"tsampa\"-eater\" was used to promote a unified Tibetan identity. Whereas Tibetans speak various dialects, worship in different sects, and live in different regions, all Tibetans were thought to eat \"tsampa\". In 1957, the India-based \"Tibet Mirror\" addressed a letter to \"all tsampa-eaters\", encouraging them to participate in what would become the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Recently, with the rise of the Tibetan diaspora, less emphasis has been placed on \"tsampa\" and more emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism in constructing a unified Tibetan identity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1152482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1152482", "title": "Popiah", "text": "Popiah\n\nPopiah () is a Fujianese/Teochew-style fresh spring roll. \"Popiah\" is often eaten in the Fujian province of China (usually in Xiamen) and its neighbouring Chaoshan (and by the Teochew and Hoklo diaspora in various regions throughout Southeast Asia) and in Taiwan (due to the heavy Hokkien influence), during the Qingming Festival.\n\nIn the Chaoshan dialect, popiah is pronounced as /poʔ˩piã˥˧/(薄餅). which means \"thin wafer\". In varieties of Hokkien, it is also commonly referred to as /lun˩piã˥˧/(潤餅), which is the etymological origin of \"lumpia\" in Indonesia and the Philippines. It is referred to as \"rùnbǐng\" (潤餅) or \"báobǐng\" (薄餅) in Mandarin, and also as \"bópíjuǎn\" (薄皮卷).\n\nA \"popiah\" \"skin\" (薄餅皮) is a soft, thin paper-like crepe or pancake made from wheat flour. The method of producing the wrapper involves making an extremely wet and viscous dough. A ball of this dough is held to the right hand, then quickly \"rubbed\" (擦潤餅皮, Hokkien: chhat jūn-piáⁿ phê, literally \"to rub a lumpia crepe\") against a hot steel plate in a circular fashion, and lifted. Through this process, a very thin layer of the wet dough adheres to the plate and begins to cook. The upper surface of the crepe is then usually cleaned of excess pieces of dough using the dough ball through a dabbing process. When the dough has been cooked to completion, it is peeled off of the hot steel plate before being removed. The rubbing is typically done over two or three plates at once, which allows the baker to continuously produce crepes and gives the proper time for each crepe to be properly cooked.\nIt is eaten in accompaniment with a sweet sauce (often a bean sauce), a blended soy sauce or hoisin sauce or a shrimp paste sauce (hae-ko, ), and optionally with hot chilli sauce before it is filled. The filling is mainly finely grated and steamed or stir-fried turnip, jicama (known locally as \"bangkuang\"), which has been cooked with a combination of other ingredients such as bean sprouts, French beans, and lettuce leaves, depending on the individual vendor, along with grated carrots, slices of Chinese sausage, thinly sliced fried tofu, chopped peanuts or peanut powder, fried shallots, and shredded omelette. Other common variations of popiah include pork (lightly seasoned and stir-fried), shrimp or crab meat. Seaweed is often included in the Xiamen versions. Some hawkers in Malaysia and Singapore, especially in non-halal settings, will add fried pork lard. As a fresh spring roll, the \"popiah\" skin itself is not fried.\n\nTwo common ways of eating this are holding them like a burrito, which some prefer, while others cut the popiah roll into slices and pick them up with chopsticks.\n\nIn mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia there are \"\"popiah\" parties\" at home, where the ingredients are laid out and guests make their own \"popiah\" with proportions ingredients to their own personal liking.\n\nIn Taiwan, \"popiah\" is eaten in several varieties which can be classified into fried and non-fried versions.\n\nThe fried version is very commonly served year-round in Chinese restaurants. It is small, crispy and rolled with meat or sweet red bean paste.\n\nThe non-fried version is much more complicated and is called \"runbing\" (潤餅) in Mandarin (still \"po̍h-piáⁿ\" (薄餅) in Taiwanese Hokkien).\nThere are two kinds of skins which roll the stuffing: one that is slowly heated until cooked is famous for being very thin; the other is baked. Furthermore, the way of cooking the stuffing is very different as well. In northern Taiwan, the stuffing is flavored, stir-fired, sometimes it goes with peanut powder, and the sauce is salty. In southern Taiwan, the popiah stuffing is water blanched without additional seasoning, and flavoured primarily with sugar and peanut powder. For people who live in southern Taiwan, the addition of sufficient sugar is key for popiah. Moreover, some people like to heat or steam the spring roll again after it is made.\n\nThe stuffing itself is quite diverse among different places. The basic stuffing includes vegetables that grow in spring, meat and thinly shredded omelet. In some places, they also add noodles, Chinese sausages, stewed vegetables instead of blanched ones, tofu, seafood, sticky rice, and so on.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, \"popiah\" is part of Chinese cuisine of these two countries. However, in both countries, as well as in Brunei, \"popiah\" especially the fried variant is also popular as part of local street food. In Vietnam, \"bò bía\" is the Vietnamese variant of popiah, introduced by Teochew immigrants. It is common to see an old Teochew man or woman selling bò bía at their roadside stand. In Thai cuisine, two types of \"popia\" () are popular: \"popia sot\" (fresh spring roll) and \"popia thot\" (deep-fried spring roll). In addition, Thai cuisine has also incorporated the Vietnamese \"summer roll\" under the name \"kuaitiao lui suan\" (). While in Burma/Myanmar, it is known as kawpyan (). Similar foods in other cuisines include the Indonesian \"Lumpia Basah\" and the Filipino \"lumpiang sariwa\" spring rolls, etymologically derived from the Hokkien name Lum Pia. Majority of ethnic Chinese in both countries are of Hokkien origin.\n\n\n"}

In addition to \"min\" and \"max\" nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has \"chance\" (\"move by nature\") nodes, which take the expected value of a random event occurring. In game theory terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an extensive-form game of perfect, but incomplete information.\n\nIn the traditional minimax method, the levels of the tree alternate from max to min until the depth limit of the tree has been reached. In an expectiminimax tree, the \"chance\" nodes are interleaved with the max and min nodes. Instead of taking the max or min of the utility values of their children, chance nodes take a weighted average, with the weight being the probability that child is reached.\n\nThe interleaving depends on the game. Each \"turn\" of the game is evaluated as a \"max\" node (representing the AI player's turn), a \"min\" node (representing a potentially-optimal opponent's turn), or a \"chance\" node (representing a random effect or player).\n\nFor example, consider a game in which each round consists of a single dice throw, and then decisions made by first the AI player, and then another intelligent opponent. The order of nodes in this game would alternate between \"chance\", \"max\" and then \"min\".\n\nThe expectiminimax algorithm is a variant of the minimax algorithm and was first proposed by Donald Michie in 1966.\nIts pseudocode is given below. \n\nNote that for random nodes, there must be a known probability of reaching each child. (For most games of chance, child nodes will be equally-weighted, which means the return value can simply be the average of all child values.)\n\n"}
{"id": "1154037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154037", "title": "Haleem", "text": "Haleem\n\nHaleem is a stew popular in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Although the dish varies from region to region, it always includes wheat or barley, and sometimes meat and/or lentils. Popular variations include keşkek in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; Hareesa in the Arab world and Armenia; Halim in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India; Khichra in Pakistan and India. Americans also have a similar dish called Farina.\n\nHaleem is made of wheat, barley, meat (usually minced beef or mutton (goat meat or Lamb and mutton) or chicken), lentils and spices, sometimes rice is also used. This dish is slow cooked for seven to eight hours, which results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley and wheat.\n\nThe origin of haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in \"The Sunday Guardian\", the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\" of Baghdad. \"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world’s oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\" it reported. The Harees was cooked as the Arab empire was extended to different parts of the world.\n\nHarees was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city. Today, Harees is still available in the Arab quarter of Hyderabad, an area called Barkas, where the dish is called Jareesh. Later on, the people of Hyderabad modified it to suit their palate thus creating modern haleem.\n\nHaleem is sold as a snack food in bazaars throughout the year. It is also a special dish prepared throughout the world during the Ramadan and Muharram months of the Muslim Hijri calendar, particularly among Pakistanis and Indian Muslims.\n\nIn India, haleem prepared in Hyderabad during the Ramadan month, is transported all over the world through a special courier service. Haleem is traditionally cooked in large, wood-fired cauldrons.\n\nHaleem is also very popular in Bangladesh, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, when it is a staple dish.\n\nIn Pakistan, Haleem is available all year round, as well as in most Pakistani restaurants around the world. Haleem is sold as a snack food and street food in Pakistani bazaars throughout the year.\n\nHaleem has become a popular dish in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana and Aurangabad, Maharashtra (Aurangabad, the first capital of Hyderabad State) in India. Originating from an Arabic dish called Harees, Haleem was introduced to the region during the Mughal period by foreign migrants.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, both haleem and khichra are made with same ingredients. In khichra, the chunks of meat remain as cubes, while in haleem the meat cubes are taken out of the pot, bones are removed, meat is crushed and put back in the pot. It is further cooked until the meat completely blends with the lentils, wheat and barley mixture.\nA traditional haleem is made by firstly soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight. A spicy meat gravy called Korma is prepared until the meat becomes tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water until they are tender. The cooked wheat, barley and lentils are then mixed with the meat (Beef or Mutton or Chicken) gravy and blended with a heavy hand mixer to obtain a paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6 hours to be completed. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions.\n\nA high-calorie dish, haleem provides protein from the meat and fibre and carbohydrates from the various combinations of grains and pulses.\n\nHaleem can be served with chopped mint leaves, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, chopped ginger root or green chilies. In some regions of Pakistan, Haleem is eaten with Naan or with any type of bread or rice.\n\n"}
{"id": "1154736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154736", "title": "Pop Rocks", "text": "Pop Rocks\n\nPop Rocks is a candy, owned by Zeta Espacial S.A. Pop Rocks ingredients include sugar, lactose (milk sugar), and flavoring. It differs from typical hard candy in that it creates a small popping reaction when it dissolves in one's mouth.\n\nThe concept was patented by General Foods research chemists Leon T. Kremzner and William A. Mitchell on December 12, 1961 (U.S. patent #3,012,893), but the candy was not offered to the public until 1975 by General Foods, which in 1983 withdrew it, citing its lack of success in the marketplace, and its relatively short shelf life.\n\nDistribution was initially controlled to ensure freshness; but with its increasing popularity, unauthorized redistribution from market to market resulted in out-of-date product reaching consumers. After that, Kraft Foods licensed the Pop Rocks brand to Zeta Espacial S.A. who continued manufacturing the product under Kraft's license. Eventually Zeta Espacial S.A. became the brand's owner and sole manufacturer. Pop Rocks is distributed in the U.S. by Pop Rocks Inc. (Atlanta, Georgia) and by Zeta Espacial S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) in the rest of the world. Zeta Espacial S.A. also sells popping candy internationally under other brands including Peta Zetas, Wiz Fizz, and Magic Gum.\n\nIn 2008, Dr. Marvin J. Rudolph, who led the group assigned to bring Pop Rocks out of the laboratory and into the manufacturing plant, wrote a history of Pop Rocks development. The book, titled \"Pop Rocks: The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy\", was based on interviews with food technologists, engineers, marketing managers, and members of Billy Mitchell's family, along with the author's experience. In the book, Dr. Rudolph points out that the Turkish company HLEKS Popping Candy flooded the market with popping candy in the year 2000.\n\nA similar product, \"Cosmic Candy\", previously called \"Space Dust\", was in powdered form and was also manufactured by General Foods.\n\nIn 2012, Cadbury Schweppes Pty. Ltd. (in Australia) began producing a chocolate product named \"Marvellous Creations Jelly Popping Candy Beanies\" which contains popping candy, jelly beans and beanies (candy covered chocolate). By 2013 Whittakers (New Zealand) had also released a local product (white chocolate with a local carbonated drink \"Lemon and Paeroa' or \"L&P\" for short). Prominent British chef Heston Blumenthal has also made several desserts incorporating popping candy, both for the peculiar sensory experience of the popping and for the nostalgia value of using an ingredient popular in the 1970s.\n\nThe candy is made by mixing its ingredients and heating them until they melt into a syrup, then exposing the mixture to pressurized carbon dioxide gas (about 600 pounds per square inch or 40 bar) and allowing it to cool. The process causes tiny high-pressure bubbles to be trapped inside the candy. When it is placed in the mouth and comes into contact with saliva the candy breaks and dissolves, releasing the carbon dioxide from the bubbles, resulting in a popping and sizzling sound and leaving a slight tingling sensation. It also releases carbon dioxide when coming in contact with any liquid. The bubbles in the candy pieces can be viewed using a microscope.\n\nRumors persisted that eating Pop Rocks and drinking soda would cause a person's stomach to boil and explode. This was, in part, caused by the false assumption that Pop Rocks contain an acid/base mixture (such as baking soda and vinegar) which produces large volumes of gas when mixed through chewing and saliva. One of these myths involved child actor John Gilchrist (\"Little Mikey\" in 1970s Life cereal television commercials), who was falsely rumored to have died after consuming excess amounts of Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola.\n\nThough the confection had been extensively tested and found safe, the carbonated candy still alarmed residents in Seattle. The Food and Drug Administration set up a hotline there to assure anxious parents that the fizzing candy would not cause their children to choke. General Foods was battling the \"exploding kid\" rumors as early as 1979. General Foods sent letters to school principals, created an open letter to parents, took out advertisements in major publications and sent the confection's inventor on the road to explain that a Pop Rocks package contains less gas (namely, carbon dioxide, the same gas used in all carbonated beverages) than half a can of soda.\n\nBecause of the unique flavor of the legend, and the duration of its perpetuation, the story has appeared in many other forms of media and fiction. On the very first episode of \"MythBusters\", Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman put the Mikey rumor to the test by mixing six packs of Pop Rocks and a six-pack of cola inside a pig's stomach, complete with enough hydrochloric acid to simulate the acid inside a human stomach. Despite the pig stomach growing to three times its initial size, it did not blow up even after time was allotted for digestion. In another stomach used as an experimental counterpart, only a large amount of sodium bicarbonate along with acid and soda (and without any Pop Rocks) was able to cause a gastric rupture. The broadcast included interview clips with Pop Rocks Inc. vice president Fernando Arguis explaining the candy and the myth, and Adam later alluded to the myth at a presentation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by showing that Pop Rocks and soda—albeit in a smaller amount—in his own stomach was not fatal.\n\n"}

When the boar took refuge in a hermitage at Eskdale, the nobles set upon the monk living there, who had closed the door on the hounds. Before he died, the monk consented to forgive them and spare their lives if they and their descendants would enact a penance.\n\nEach year, on the eve of Ascension Day, on the east bank of the River Esk in Whitby, they had to construct a short hedge from stakes woven together, able to withstand three tides. The instructions stipulated that a knife \"of a penny price\" was to be used.\n\nThe ceremony is still performed in Whitby every year on Ascension Eve, by the occupiers of the land formerly owned by the Abbot. A horn is sounded and followed by the cry \"\"Out on ye! Out on ye! Out on ye!\"\" or \"\"Out on ye - for the heinous crime on ye\"\". The date of the ceremony on Ascension Eve, has been taken as being 38 days from Easter Sunday. With this, it was easy to predict that the tides would be low by 9:00 am each morning as Easter Sunday is decided and regulated by the moon and the moon dictates the tides also. However, in its 858 year history, the ceremony could not be completed in 1981, due to the tide being too high. Apart from 1981, the ceremony has been carried out each year (according to available documents).\n\nThe tradition is said to have dated back to a ritual known as \"Horngarth\". This was a requirement of tenants to maintain the hedges that divided their lands, otherwise they would forfeit them to the Abbot of Whitby. The folk-tale about the death of the hermit, has led many writers and historians to believe this was just a story attached to the tradition of the upkeep of hedges and hedgerows.\n\nThe Penny Hedge legend is a major plot point in the children's book \"The Whitby Child\" by Robin Jarvis.\n"}

A \"pasar malam\" is a street market in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore that opens in the evening, usually in residential neighbourhoods.\n\nIt brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as snacks, local favourite dishes, fruits, clothes, shoes, toys, balloons, watch and alarm clocks, knick-knacks and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. Unauthorized copies of DVDs, CDs and computer software are often sold at a pasar malam. \n\nPasar malam might resemble a night festival or a fairground, where fair games and kiddy rides, like mini carousel or mini train ride may also present. Several quintessential fair snacks like cotton candy, ice cream, hot dogs and grilled sausages are also popular, next to the offerings of traditional local delicacies. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. Haggling over prices is a common practice at such markets.\n\nIn Indonesian archipelago, markets are traditionally held in different days with locations rotating among participating villages. This traditional economic custom is known as \"Hari Pasaran\" (lit. \"market days\") in Javanese. After being further developed, market was established more permanently like it is today. The night market is regarded as the continuation of this non-permanent market culture. Night market are usually held during special occasion or festival, such as Sekaten festival in Java, or held in Ramadhan nights, approximately a week before Lebaran. \n\nAfter the discovery of electricity and lightbulb, the night markets were held more frequently in colonial Dutch East Indies in early 20th century. The most notable one is Pasar Gambir, a night market fair held in 1906 and yearly from 1921 until the outbreak of World War II in 1942, in the Koningsplein, Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Merdeka Square, Jakarta, Indonesia) to celebrate the birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. It has become the predecessor of the annual Jakarta Fair and Den Haag's Tong Tong Fair which are actually a night market and festival held for several weeks.\n\nIn Java, especially in the Javanese royal cities Yogyakarta and Surakarta, the grand week-long pasar malam is usually held annually during the Sekaten festival to celebrate Mawlid or the birthday of prophet Muhammad. During colonial Dutch East Indies the annual Pasar Malam was held in Pasar Gambir (today Merdeka square) and become the predecessor of modern Jakarta's annual Jakarta Fair. \n\nToday, several \"kecamatan\" (district) in Jakarta and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly pasar malam, usually every Saturday night in a nearby \"alun-alun\" square, open fields or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling variety of goods and foods, some pasar malam also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini carousel or mini train ride. In Palembang, a popular pasar malam is located on front of Kuto Besak Fort on the bank of Musi River. This pasar malam sells local dishes and snacks such as pempek, lenggang and tekwan, and also offers souvenirs and handy crafts.\n\nIn Malaysia, Pasar Malam are normally setup at temporary closed street for vehicle and open for pedestrian during evening until late night on weekly basis. At certain location due to frequency or few time in a week, narrow and busy street also safety reasons, Pasar Malam will open at Tapak Pasar Malam on nighttime which describe an allocation space that convert a parking space during a daytime. \n\nDue to the hot Malaysian weather during the daytime, the Pasar Malam has become a nightlife activity that attracts local community after working time and tourist crowd to shop with moderate night temperatures looking for cheap hot foods, clothing, groceries and etc. The vendor licenses are obtained from local authorities under the local council area. \n\nMajority of the local vendor selling plenty type of drinks, hot foods and local delicacies from Malay, Malaysian Chinese and Indian background which are famous and also the difficult to find, fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fish and seafoods, fresh meat and poultry, toys, family range of clothes and accessories.

An info on location, opening day and hours will certainly useful. As the name implied, opening hours normally late at 5:00 PM and close at 11:00 PM or until foods sold out.\n\nIn Singapore, food hawkers at pasar malam are required to get a licence from local council to ensure health, cleanliness and to control numbers to avoid traffic congestion. A food handler is required to get a medical checkup and Typhim VI injections, The pasar malam site is allocated by the local council.\n\nIn the Netherlands, a yearly Indo Eurasian festival is held in The Hague under the name \"Tong Tong Fair\", formerly known as the \"Pasar Malam Besar\" (\"besar\" meaning \"big\"). Due to the high number of Indo-Eurasians and the successive success of this event since 1959, dozens of pasar malam are held each year in the Netherlands.

Ajvar is used in the Balkans in Serbian, Albanian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, and to a small degree the Slovenian and Russian cuisine. In Serbia, it was long known as \"Serbian salad\" or \"Serbian vegetable caviar\". It became a popular side dish throughout Yugoslavia after World War II and is nowadays popular in Southeastern Europe.\n\nHomemade ajvar is made of roasted or cooked peppers. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of added chili peppers, it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or very hot (\"ljutenica\"). Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread or as a side dish. There are few variations of ajvar. If it contains tomato, then it is called pindjur or if it contains eggplant is called malidzano.\n\nThe name \"ajvar\" comes from the Turkish word \"havyar\", which means \"salted roe, caviar\" shares an etymology with \"caviar\". Prior to the 20th century, there was a significant local production of caviar on the Danube, with sturgeon swimming from the Black Sea up to Belgrade. Domestic \"ajvar\", meaning \"caviar\", used to be a very popular dish in Belgrade homes and restaurants. However, the domestic production of caviar was not steady starting in the 1890s because of labor disputes, and eventually a special pepper salad was offered as a substitute in Belgrade restaurants under the name \"red ajvar\" (\"crveni ajvar\") or \"Serbian ajvar\" (\"srpski ajvar\").\n\nThere is a dispute considering the origin of ajvar as both North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia claim to be the original creators of the ajvar recipe.\n\nHomemade ajvar is made of roasted peppers, while some industrial producers use cooked peppers, which leads to a lower quality. Ajvar preparation is somewhat difficult, because it requires considerable manual labour, Particularly for peeling the roasted peppers. Traditionally, people prepare it in mid-autumn, when bell peppers are most abundant, and preserve it in glass jars for consumption throughout the year. Anecdotally, most households' stocks do not last until the spring, when fresh vegetables become available, so it is usually enjoyed as a winter food. Often, the whole family or neighbours gather to prepare the bell peppers. The principal cultivar of pepper used is called \"roga\" (i.e. \"horned\"). \"Roga\" is large, red, horn-shaped, with thick flesh and relatively easy to peel. It typically ripens in late September.\n\nTo produce ajvar, bell peppers are roasted whole on a plate on an open fire, a plate of wood in a stove, or in an oven. The baked peppers must briefly cool to allow the flesh to separate from the skin. Next, the skin is carefully peeled off and the seeds are removed. The peppers are then ground in a mill or chopped into tiny pieces (this variant is often referred to as pindjur). Finally, the resulting mush is stewed for several hours in large pots. Sunflower oil is added at this stage to condense and reduce the water, and to enhance later preservation. Salt (and sometimes vinegar) is added at the end and the hot mush is poured directly into sterilized glass jars, which are sealed immediately.\n\nAjvar is produced in various countries, including Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia. Serbia's reported annual production is 640 tons.\n\nAjvar is one of the so-called \"zimnica\" (winter foods), which include pickled chili peppers, pickled tomatoes, and anything else that can be preserved in a jar just before winter.\n\n\n"}

The name of this unique festival supposedly comes from a twisting of the word \"enagua\" (\"petticoat\"), which the prostitutes of the town used to wear under their dresses. According to tradition, during Lent the prostitutes were sent to the other side of the Tormes River so that the men of the town were not distracted during the religious observances. On Easter Monday, the students of the town threw a party on the banks of the river to celebrate the return of the women, and ate hornazo as part of the celebration.\n\nIn other places in the country there are dishes similar to hornazo that contain hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient. In some parts of Spain a \"bollo de hornazo\" is a sweet and dry bread which is decorated with hard-boiled eggs. These dishes are also traditionally consumed in and around Easter. This may be because long ago, eggs were considered a sort of meat, and were therefore prohibited during Lent, a fact that did not stop the chickens from laying eggs. The eggs were preserved by hard-boiling them, and then used for cooking in dishes like hornazo. From this tradition it is probable that Easter eggs came into being, but their exact origins are unknown.\n\n\nThis is a translation from an article at the Spanish Wikipedia \n"}

The Liefmans brewery uses oud bruin beer instead of lambic to make its framboise beer, resulting in a very different taste.\n\nFramboise is also commonly used to refer to eau de vie distilled with raspberries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1165538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1165538", "title": "McRib", "text": "McRib\n\nMcRib is a barbecue-flavored pork sandwich periodically sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. It was first introduced to the McDonald's menu in 1981, following test marketing the year before.\n\nAfter poor sales, it was removed from the menu in 1985. McRib was reintroduced in 1989, staying on the menu until 2005 in many countries. Since 2006, it has generally been made available for a short time each year in most markets where it is sold, typically during the fall season, although is a permanent menu item at McDonald's restaurants in Germany and Luxembourg.\n\nMcRib consists of a restructured boneless pork patty shaped like a miniature rack of ribs, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles served on a roll. The process of restructuring the meat was first developed by the US Army as a means to deliver low cost meat products to troops in the field. This process was further refined by a Natick Center contractor and meat scientist, Dr. Roger Mandigo, leading to the McRib patty as we know it today. Despite its name, it is primarily composed of pork shoulder meat, according to McDonald's.\n\nMcRib Jr. was available briefly in 2000. This version replaced the roll with a standard hamburger bun, and was served with two pickles and a smaller pork patty.\n\nMcRib made its debut in the United States in 1981, as a limited time item. It was developed by McDonald's first Executive Chef René Arend, a native from Luxembourg, who invented Chicken McNuggets in 1979.\n\n\"The McNuggets were so well received that every franchise wanted them,\" said Arend in a 2009 interview. \"There wasn’t a system to supply enough chicken. We had to come up with something to give the other franchises as a new product. \n\nSo the McRib came about because of the shortage of chickens.\" It was his inspiration to shape the McRib patty \"like a slab of ribs,\" despite the fact that a round patty would have been cheaper to manufacture and serve on standard hamburger buns.\n\nMcRib was not immediately successful. It test-marketed very well in the Midwest, and was added to the restaurant's permanent menu for the United States in 1981. Sales were mediocre, however, and it was removed in 1985 as McDonald's executives determined that pork is not eaten frequently enough in the United States to stay on the menu. \n\nAfter several years, it returned for a promotion. It is more popular in Germany, where it remains a permanent item. McRib was also brought back occasionally in 1989, 1990 (together with the \"BBQ in a Bag\" promotion), 1991, 1992 (with the Western Omelette McMuffin as part of a Western promotion), and 1993.\n\nIn summer 1994, McDonald's brought back McRib nationally, as a tie in with the theatrical release of \"The Flintstones\", comparing the appearance of it with the rack of ribs that topples the Flintmobile in both the animated and live action productions. McDonald's (which was featured in the film as \"RocDonald's\") supported the return with McRib packaging featuring the Flintstones characters and a television commercial featuring Rosie O'Donnell in her role as Betty Rubble.\n\nOn November 1, 2005, McDonald's issued a press release announcing that McRib would be permanently removed from the menu following a \"McRib Farewell Tour\". McRib.com, a website registered to McDonald's, featured a petition to \"Save the McRib\", which was facetiously sponsored by the \"Boneless Pig Farmers Association of America\". On October 16, 2006, the \"McRib Farewell Tour II\" site appeared.\n\nMcRib reappeared in the United States in October 2007, beginning a third \"farewell tour\". McDonald's sold 30 million made with over 7 million pounds (3 million kg) of pork in 2007. Its fourth reintroduction was in the end of October 2008, across the United States, Hong Kong, and Japan, with a promotional website featuring music sponsored by a \"McRib DJ Plowman\" in tribute to its creator. \n\nAdditional limited time regional offerings, in various regions of the United States as well as in Canada, were made throughout 2008 and 2009.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, McDonald's began six weeks of nationwide McRib availability at the \"Legends of the McRib\" event in New York City, honoring three superfans: Joey Erwin, aka Mr. McRib; Alan Klein, founder of the McRib Locator website; and Adam Winer. The promotion ended December 5, 2010. McDonald's credited it with boosting their November 2010 sales by 4.8%. It was the first national offering of the McRib since 1994.\n\nMcRib was offered in Canada from June 21 to August 1, 2011. On October 24, 2011, McDonald's once again made the McRib available for three weeks in a promotion ending November 14.\n\nIn celebration of the London Olympics 2012, McDonald's Australia and New Zealand reintroduced McRib as the Atlanta Pork McRib. McRib was one of six limited edition McDonald's items named after previous host cities. It was released on Wednesday 23 May and ran until June 5. Sales of McRib in New Zealand exceeded expectations, exhausting supplies within days of the release of the burger with restaurants running out of their allocations of stock.\n\nFor 2012, McDonald's announced that McRib's annual release would be delayed until the December 17, as opposed to its traditional autumn release (which would instead be used to debut the Cheddar Bacon Onion Angus Burger, or \"CBO\"). The move was an effort to boost sales during the December period in an attempt to match 2011's abnormally high restaurant wide sales figures. \n\nMcRib wasn't released nationally and was sold only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2005 \"McRib Farewell Tour\" promotion) in 2013 due to the company introducing several new products (such as the Mighty Wings). McRib was sold again starting on October 20, 2014 and ending on January 4, 2015, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2006 \"McRib Farewell Tour II\" promotion).\n\nMcRib made a return in the United Kingdom on December 31, 2014 until February 3, 2015. McRib was sold again starting on October 2015 and ending in January 2016, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (55 percent of McDonald's locations). It became available again in November 2016, but at a limited number of McDonald's locations; and once more since October 2017, but in most areas. Local McDonalds twitter accounts announced in Southern California and Hawaii that the McRib would be returning to these locations on 2 and 9 November 2017 respectively. The McRib once again made a limited return in the United States and Australia at participating locations starting in October 2018.\n\nIn November 2011, the Humane Society of the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the producer of McRib meat, Smithfield Foods, alleging cruel and unusual treatment of the animals used in the McRib patty production. The complaint cites the use of gestation crates and poor and unsanitary living conditions, as well as a lack of proper animal welfare.\n\nSpeculation on the limited availability of the McRib includes theories concerning the fluctuating price and unreliable supply chains of bulk pork, manipulation of availability windows to turn the product into a better loss leader for the company, and the generation of renewed enthusiasm and higher sales as a result of scarcity. \n\nAn informal study from 2011 entitled \"A Conspiracy of Hogs: The McRib as Arbitrage\" illustrates a correlation between the price of pork and the timing of McDonald's offering the sandwich; all five of the US McRib offerings between 2005 and 2011 occurred during low points in the price of bulk pork.\n\nThe official explanation from the McDonald's website concerning the sandwich's limited availability is: \"We like to change up our menu throughout the year by offering some limited time only items, like our Shamrock Shake in the Spring. The timing of the McRib's return can vary from year to year, but most recently, it's made its appearance in the Fall\". \n\n\n"}

It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however, there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.\n\nBanana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 \"Balanced Recipes\" cookbook, and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original \"Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book\" in 1950.\n\nNational Banana Bread day is 23 February. Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s and it took a while for them to appear as ingredient items for desserts. The modern banana bread recipe began being published in cookbooks around the 1930s and its popularity was greatly helped by the introduction of baking powder on the market. Some food historians believe banana bread was a byproduct of the Great Depression as resourceful housewives did not wish to throw away overripe bananas (as they were still a costly item to purchase), others believe the modern banana bread was developed in corporate kitchens to promote flour and baking soda products. It could also be a combination of both theories, insofar as being developed in a corporate kitchen to promote flour and baking soda products, as well as marketed as a method to make use of overripe bananas. \n\n"}
{"id": "1167759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1167759", "title": "Panchromatic film", "text": "Panchromatic film\n\nPanchromatic emulsion is a type of black-and-white photographic emulsion that is sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light.\n\nA panchromatic emulsion produces a realistic reproduction of a scene as it appears to the human eye, although with no colors. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost two to three times as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.\n\nOrthochromatic film proved troublesome for motion pictures, rendering pink skies as perpetually overcast, blond hair as washed-out, blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black. To some degree this could be corrected by makeup, lens filters, and lighting, but never completely satisfactorily. But even those solutions were unusable for additive color motion picture systems like Kinemacolor and Prizma color, which photographed on black-and-white stock behind alternating color filters. In those cases, negative film stock after it arrived from the manufacturer had to be passed through a color-sensitizing solution, a time-consuming process that increased the film's cost from 3 cents per foot to 7 cents. Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film, introduced a panchromatic film stock in September 1913, available on special order for photographing color motion pictures in additive systems. Cameramen began using it for black-and-white films too in 1918, primarily for outdoor scenes. The company introduced Kodak Panchromatic Cine Film as a regular stock in 1922. The first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock was \"The Headless Horseman\" (1922). But panchromatic stock was more expensive, and not until the prices were equalized by competition in 1926 did it become used more widely than orthochromatic stock. Kodak discontinued manufacturing general-purpose orthochromatic motion picture film in 1930.\n\nDigital panchromatic imagery of the Earth's surface is also produced by some modern satellites, such as QuickBird, Cartosat and IKONOS. This imagery is extremely useful, as it is generally of a much higher (spatial) resolution than the multispectral imagery from the same satellite. For example, the QuickBird satellite produces panchromatic imagery having a pixel equivalent to an area , while the multispectral pixels represent an area of .\n\n"}

The fermentation process also produces fish sauce known as patís.\n\nThe preparation of bagoóng can vary regionally in the Philippines.\n\nBagoóng is usually made from a variety of fish species, including the following:\n\nBagoóng made from fish is encompassed by the term \"bagoóng isdâ\" (lit. \"fish bagoong\") in Luzon and northern parts of the Visayas. They can be distinguished further by the type of fish they are made of. Those made from anchovies are generally known as \"bagoong monamon\" or \"bagoong dilis\" and those from bonnetmouths as \"bagoong terong\". \n\nIn the southern Visayas and Mindanao, fish bagoong made from anchovies is known as \"guinamos\" (also spelled \"ginamos\"). Larger fermented fish are known as \"tinabal\".\n\nBagoong can also be made from krill. This type of bagoong is known as \"bagoong alamang\". It is called \"uyap\" or \"alamang\" in the southern Philippines, \"aramang\" in Ilocos and parts of Northern Luzon, and \"ginamos\" or \"dayok\" in western Visayas.\n\nIn rarer instances, it can also be made from oysters, clams, and fish and shrimp roe. A kind of bagoong made in the town of Balayan, Batangas is also known as \"bagoong Balayan\".\n\n\"Bagoong isda\" is prepared by mixing salt and fish usually by volume; mixture proportions are proprietary depending on the manufacturer. The salt and fish are mixed uniformly, usually by hand. The mixture is kept inside large earthen fermentation jars (known as \"tapayan\" in Tagalog and Visayan languages, and \"burnay\" in Ilocano). It is covered, to keep flies away, and left to ferment for 30–90 days with occasional stirring to make sure the salt is spread evenly. The mixture can significantly expand during the process.\n\nThe preparation of \"bagoong alamang\" (shrimp or krill paste) is similar, with krill cleaned thoroughly and washed in weak brine solution (10%). As in fish bagoong, the shrimp are then mixed with salt in a 25% salt to 75% shrimp ratio by weight.\n\nThe products of the fermentation process are usually pale gray to white in color. To obtain the characteristic red or pink color of some bagoong, a kind of food coloring known as \"angkak\" is added. \"Angkak\" is made from rice inoculated with a species of red mold (\"Monascus purpureus\"). High quality salt with little mineral impurities are preferred. High metallic content in the salt used can often result in darker colors to the resulting bagoong and a less agreeable undertaste. Likewise, oversalting and undersalting also has a significant impact on the rate and quality of fermentation due to their effects on the bacteria involved in the process. Some manufacturers grind the fermented product finely and sell the resulting mixture as fish paste.\n\n\"Patís\" or fish sauce is a byproduct of the fermentation process. It is a clear, yellowish liquid that floats above the fermented mixture, and has sharp salty or cheese-like flavor. Sauces similar to patís include \"nước mắm\" in Vietnam, \"nam pha\" (ນ້ຳປາ) in Laos, \"hom ha\" in China, \"nam pla\" in Thailand, \"shitsuru\" in Japan and \"saeu chot\" in Korea, as well as the garum of ancient Greece and the Roman empire.\n\nTo obtain patís, fermentation is longer, usually taking six months to a year. During the longer fermentation processes, the fish or shrimp constituents disintegrate further, producing a clear yellowish liquid on top of the mixture due to hydrolysis. This is the patis, it can be harvested once it has developed its characteristic smell. It is drained, pasteurized, and bottled separately, while the residue is turned into bagoong. If the residual solids are not moist enough, brine is usually added. The rate of fermentation can vary depending on the pH levels of the mixture and the temperature. Exposure to sunlight can also reduce the amount of time required to two months.\n\nOver the centuries, western unfamiliarity with bagoong has given it a reputation as an \"exotic\" dish, portrayed in a positive or negative light depending on the point of view of the writer. For example, one early description was Spanish colonial official Antonio de Morga, whose book \"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas\" (Events in the Philippine Isles) included a description of bagoong as \"fish which ... has started to rot and stink.\" This later prompted preeminent Philippine nationalist Jose Rizal to denounce the descriptions in his 1890 annotation, saying:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1168988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1168988", "title": "Shawl", "text": "Shawl\n\nA shawl (from \"shāl\", which may be from duśālā, ultimately from Sanskrit: शाटी śāṭī) is a simple item of clothing, loosely worn over the shoulders, upper body and arms, and sometimes also over the head. It is usually a rectangular or square piece of cloth, which is often folded to make a triangle, but can also be triangular in shape. Other shapes include oblong shawls.\n\nThe words \"shawl\" and \"pashmina\" come from Kashmir, but originate from Hamedan, Iran. Sources report cashmere crafts were introduced by Sayeed Ali Hamadani, when the 14th century came to Ladakh, homeland of pashmina goats, where, for the first time in history, he found that the Ladakhi kashmiri goats produced soft wool. He took some of this goat wool and made socks which he gave as a gift to king of Kashmir, Sultan Qutabdin. Afterwards, Hamadani suggested to the king that they start a shawl weaving industry in Kashmir using this wool. That is how pashmina shawls began. The United Nations agency UNESCO reported in 2014 that Ali Hamadani was one of the principal historical figures who shaped the culture of Kashmir, both architecturally and through the flourishing of arts and crafts, and hence economy, in Kashmir. The skills and knowledge that he brought to Kashmir gave rise to an entire industry.\n\nKashmir was a pivotal point through which the wealth, knowledge, and products of ancient India passed to the world. Perhaps the most widely known woven textiles are the famed Kashmir shawls. The \"Kanikar\", for instance, has intricately woven designs that are formalized imitations of Nature. The \"Chenar\" leaf (plane tree leaf), \"apple and cherry blossoms\", the \"rose and tulip\", the \"almond and pear\", the \"nightingale\"—these are done in deep mellow tones of maroon, dark red, gold yellow and browns. Yet another type of Kashmir shawl is the \"Jamiavr\", which is a brocaded woolen fabric sometimes in pure wool and sometimes with a little cotton added.\nThe floral design appears in a heavy, close embroidery-like weave in dull silk or soft \"pashmina\" (Persian, meaning \"woolen\"), and usually comprises small or large flowers delicately sprayed and combined; some shawls have net-like patterns with floral ensemble motifs in them. Still another type of Kashmir shawl is the double-sided \"Dourukha\" (Persian, meaning \"having two faces\"), a woven shawl that is so done as to produce the same effect on both sides. This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured schematic pattern is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the \"rafugar\" (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This attractive mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs expressed in different shawls.\n\nThe most expensive shawls, called shahtoosh, are made from the under-fleece of the Tibetan antelope or Chiru. These shawls are so fine that even a very tightly woven shawl can be easily pulled through a small finger ring.\n\nThe \"naksha\", a Persian device like the Jacquard loom invented centuries later, enabled Indian weavers to create sinuous floral patterns and creeper designs in brocade to rival any painted by a brush. The Kashmir shawl that evolved from this expertise in its heyday had greater fame than any other Indian textile. Always a luxury commodity, the intricate, tapestry-woven, fine wool shawl had become a fashionable wrap for the ladies of the English and French elite by the 18th century. Supply fell short of demand and manufacturers pressed to produce more, created convincing embroidered versions of the woven shawls that could be produced in half the time. As early as 1803, Kashmiri needlework production was established to increase and hasten output of these shawls, which had been imitated in England since 1784 and even in France. By 1870, the advent of the \"Jacquard\" loom in Europe destroyed the exclusivity of the original Kashmir shawl, which began to be produced in Paisley, Scotland. Even the characteristic Kashmiri motif, the \"mango-shape\", began to be known simply as the \"paisley\".\nThe paisley motif is so ubiquitous to Indian fabrics that it is hard to realize that it is only about 250 years old. It evolved from 1600s floral and tree-of-life designs that were created in expensive, tapestry-woven Mughal textiles. The design in India originated from Persian motif called \"butta-jeghgha\" which represents a stylized cypress tree, the symbol of Iranians. Early designs depicted single plants with large flowers and thin wavy stems, small leaves and roots. As the designs became denser over time, more flowers and leaves were compacted within the shape of the tree, or issuing from vases or a pair of leaves. By the late 18th century, the archetypal curved point at the top of an elliptical outline had evolved. The elaborate paisley created on Kashmir shawls became the vogue in Europe for over a century, and it was imitations of these shawls woven in factories at Paisley, Scotland, that gave it the name \"paisley\" still commonly used in the United States and Europe. In the late 18th century and 19th century, the paisley became an important motif in a wide range of Indian textiles, perhaps because it was associated with the Mughal court. It also caught the attention of poorer and non-Muslim Indians because it resembles a mango. \"Rural Indians called an \"aam\" or mango a symbol of fertility\".\n\nThe first shawls, or \"shals\", were used in Assyrian times; later they went into widespread use in the Middle East. Shawls were also part of the traditional male costume in Kashmir. They were woven in extremely fine woollen twill, some such as the Orenburg shawl, were even said to be as fine as the Shatoosh. They could be in one colour only, woven in different colours (called \"tilikar\"), ornately woven or embroidered (called \"ameli\").\nKashmiri shawls were high-fashion garments in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century. Paisley shawls, imitation Kashmiri shawls woven in Paisley, Renfrewshire, are the origin of the name of the traditional paisley pattern. Shawls were also manufactured in the city of Norwich, Norfolk from the late 18th century (and some two decades before Paisley) until about the 1870s.\n\nSilk shawls with fringes, made in China, were available by the first decade of the 19th century. Ones with embroidery and fringes were available in Europe and the Americas by 1820. These were called \"China crêpe shawls\" or \"China shawls\", and in Spain \"mantones de Manila\" because they were shipped to Spain from China via the port of Manila. The importance of these shawls in fashionable women's wardrobes declined between 1865 and 1870 in Western culture. However, they became part of folk dress in a number of places including Germany, the Near East, various parts of Latin America, and Spain where they became a part of Romani (\"gitana\") dress especially in Andalusia and Madrid. These embroidered items were revived in the 1920s under the name of Spanish shawls. Their use as part of the costume of the lead in the opera \"Carmen\" contributed to the association of the shawls with Spain rather than China.\n\nSome cultures incorporate shawls of various types into their national folk dress, mainly because the relatively unstructured shawls were much more commonly used in earlier times.\n\nShawls are used in order to keep warm, to complement a costume, and for symbolic reasons. One famous type of shawl is the tallit, worn by Jewish men during prayers and ceremonies. Today, shawls are worn for added warmth (and fashion) at outdoor or indoor evening affairs, where the temperature is warm enough for men in suits, but not for women in dresses and where a jacket might be inappropriate.\n\nKashmir is India's northernmost state and was the point through which ancient India passed to the world. The Kashmir shawl that evolved from a local expertise had greater fame than any other Indian textile.\n\nThe majority of the woollen fabrics of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of \"Pashm\" or \"Pashmina\", which is the wool of \"Capra hircus\", a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls came to be called Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best fleece wool is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft fleece wool from which were made the famous and much coveted 'ring shawls' in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir.\n\nThe needle-worked \"Amlikar\" or \"Amli\", made from Pashmina wool is a shawl embroidered almost all over with the needle on a plain woven ground. The colours most commonly seen on pashmina shawls are yellow, white, black, blue, green, purple, crimson and scarlet. The design motifs are usually formalised imitations of nature like the leaf, flower and tree designs mentioned above; they are always done in rich colours.\n\nThe embroidery stitch employed is rather like the parallel darning stitch and is rarely allowed to penetrate the entire fabric.\n\nThe outlines of the design are further touched up and emphasized with silk or woollen thread of different colours run round the finer details; the stitch used for this is at an angle overlapping darn stitch, all the stitches used are so minute and fine that individually they can be seen with the unaided eye only with difficulty. When Pashmina wool is used for the embroidery work, it is made to blend so intimately with the texture of the basic shawl material that it would be difficult to insert even a fine needle between the embroidery stitches and the basic fabric.\n\nThe Emperor Akbar was a great admirer of the shawls of Kashmir. It was he who began the fashion of wearing them in duplicate, sewn back to back, so that the under surfaces of the shawls were never seen. During that time the most desired shawls were those worked in gold and silver thread or shawls with border ornamented with fringes of gold, silver and silk thread.\n\nThe \"Do-shala\", as the name designates (\"two-shawl\"), are always sold in pairs, there being many varieties of them. In the \"Khali-matan\" the central field is quite plain and without any ornamentation. The \"Char-bagan\" is made up of four pieces in different colours neatly joined together; the central fluid of the shawl is embellished with a medallion of flowers. However, when the field is ornamented with flowers in the four corners we have the Kunj.\n\nPerhaps the most characteristic of the Kashmir shawls is the one made like patchwork. The patterns are woven on the looms in long strips, about twelve to eighteen inches in length and from one half to two inches in width. These design strips, made on very simple and primitive looms, are then cut to the required lengths and very neatly and expertly hand sewn together with almost invisible stitches and finally joined by sewing to a plain central field piece. As a variation, pieces may be separately woven, cut up in various shapes of differing sizes and expertly sewn together and then further elaborated with embroidery. But there is a difference between these two types: while the patchwork loom shawls are made up from separate narrow strips, the patchwork embroidered shawls consists of a certain number of irregularly shaped pieces joined together, each one balancing the predominant colour scheme of the shawl.\n\nThe basic material for a \"gubba\" is milled blanket dyed in plain colour. Embroidery is bold and vivid in designing and done with woollen or cotton threads. Gubbas have more of a folk flavour blankets cut and patched into geometric patterns, with limited, embroidery on joining and open space. It is more like appliqué work. Colours are bright and attractive. They are cheap and used for \"dewan\" covering or as floor covering—\"namdas\".\n\nTriangular knit lace shawls are usually knitted from the neck down, and may or may not be shaped. In contrast, Faroese lace shawls are knitted bottom up and contain a centre back gusset. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually also shoulder shaping.\n\n\"The shawls made in Kashmir occupy a pre-eminent place among textile products; and it is to them and to their imitations from Western looms that specific importance attaches. The Kashmir shawl is characterized by the elaboration of its design, in which the \"cone\" pattern is a prominent feature, and by the glowing harmony, brilliance, depth, and enduring qualities of its colours. The basis of these excellences is found in the very fine, soft, short, flossy under-wool, called pashm or pashmina, found on the shawl-goat, a variety of \"Capra hircus\" inhabiting the elevated regions of Tibet. There are several varieties of pashm, but the finest is a strict monopoly of the maharaja of Kashmir. Inferior pashm and Kerman wool — a fine soft Persian sheep's wool — are used for shawl weaving at Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, where colonies of Kashmiri weavers are established. Of shawls, apart from shape and pattern, there are only two principal classes: (1) loom-woven shawls called tiliwalla, tilikar or kani kar — sometimes woven in one piece, but more often in small segments which are sewn together with such precision that the sewing is quite imperceptible; and (2) embroidered shawls — amlikar — in which over a ground of plain pashmina is worked by needle a minute and elaborate pattern.\" from \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\", 1911 \n\nA stole is a woman's shawl, especially a formal shawl of expensive fabric, used around the shoulders over a party dress or ball gown. A stole is narrower than a typical shawl and of simpler construction than a cape; it is a length of a quality material, wrapped and carried about the shoulders or arms. Lighter materials such as silk and chiffon are simply \"finished\", that is, cropped, hemmed, and bound; heavier materials such as fur and brocade are often lined as well.\n\nA stole can also mean a fur or set of furs, (usually fox) worn as a stole with a suit or gown; the pelage or skin, of a single animal (head included) is generally used with street dress while for formal wear a finished length of fur using the skins of more than one animal is used; the word stole stands alone or is used in combination: \"fur stole\", \"mink stole\", the namesake of Dreamlander Mink Stole.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1169777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169777", "title": "Cobbler (food)", "text": "Cobbler (food)\n\nCobbler is a dish consisting of a fruit or savoury filling poured into a large baking dish and covered with a batter, biscuit, or dumpling (in the United Kingdom) before being baked. Some cobbler recipes, especially in the American south, resemble a thick-crusted, deep-dish pie with both a top and bottom crust. Cobbler is part of the cuisine of the United Kingdom and United States, and should not be confused with a crumble.\n\nCobblers originated in the British American colonies. English settlers were unable to make traditional suet puddings due to lack of suitable ingredients and cooking equipment, so instead covered a stewed filling with a layer of uncooked plain biscuits or dumplings, fitted together. The origin of the name \"cobbler\", recorded from 1859, is uncertain: it may be related to the archaic word \"cobeler\", meaning \"wooden bowl\".\n\nNote the crisp and crumble differ from the cobbler in that the former's top layers may also include rolled oats made with oatmeal.\n\nGrunts, pandowdy, and slumps are Canadian Maritimes and New England varieties of cobbler, typically cooked on the stovetop, or in an iron skillet or pan, with the dough on top in the shape of dumplings. They reportedly take their name from the grunting sound they make while cooking. Another name for the types of biscuits or dumplings used is \"dough-boys\". Dough-boys are used in stews and cobblers alike.\n\nIn the United States, additional varieties of cobbler include the apple pan dowdy (an apple cobbler whose crust has been broken and perhaps stirred back into the filling), the Betty, the buckle (made with yellow batter (like cake batter), with the filling mixed in with the batter), the dump (or dump cake), the grump, the slump, and the sonker. The sonker is unique to North Carolina: it is a deep-dish version of the American cobbler.\n\nIn the Deep South, cobblers most commonly come in single fruit varieties and are named as such, e.g. blackberry, blueberry, and peach cobbler. The Deep South tradition also gives the option of topping the fruit cobbler with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream. Savoury cobblers are less common in the region; for example, tomato cobbler, which may include onion and a biscuit topping that may include cheese or cornmeal, is one savoury variant that also resembles Southern tomato pie.\n\nThe American variant known as the Betty or brown Betty dates from native times. In 1864, in the \"Yale Literary Magazine\", it appeared with \"brown\" in lower case, thus making \"Betty\" the proper name. In 1890, however, a recipe was published in \"Practical Sanitary and Economic Cooking Adapted to Persons of Moderate and Small Means\" with the word \"Brown\" capitalised, making \"Brown Betty\" the proper name.\n\nBrown Betties are made with breadcrumbs (or bread pieces, or graham cracker crumbs), and fruit, usually diced apples, in alternating layers. They are baked covered and have a consistency like bread pudding.\n\nIn the midwestern United States, \"apple or strawberry Betty\" is often a synonym for \"apple crisp\".\n\nIn the UK and British Commonwealth, the scone-topped cobbler predominates, and is found in both sweet and savoury versions. Common sweet fillings include apple, blackberry, and peach. Savoury versions, such as beef, lamb, or mutton, consist of a casserole filling, sometimes with a simple ring of cobbles around the edge, rather than a complete layer, to aid cooking of the meat. Cheese or herb scones may also be used as a savoury topping.\n\nCobblers and crumbles were promoted by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War, since they are filling, yet require less butter than a traditional pastry, and can be made with margarine.\n\n"}

It is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish, often served on Shabbat and Yom Tov.\n\nThe name of the dish comes from the Middle High German \"kugel\" meaning \"sphere, globe, ball\"; thus the Yiddish name likely originated as a reference to the round, puffed-up shape of the original dishes (compare to German \"Gugelhupf\"—a type of ring-shaped cake). Nowadays, however, kugels are often baked in square pans.\n\nWhile Litvaks (Jews from Lithuania, northern Poland and northern Russia) call the pudding \"kugel\", Galitzianers (Jews from southeastern Poland and western Ukraine) call it \"kigel\". \n\nThe first kugels were made from bread and flour and were savory rather than sweet. About 800 years ago, cooks in Germany replaced bread mixtures with noodles or farfel. Eventually eggs were incorporated. The addition of cottage cheese and milk created a custard-like consistency common in today's dessert dishes. In Poland, Jewish homemakers added raisins, cinnamon and sweet curd cheese to noodle kugel recipes. In the late 19th century, Jerusalemites combined caramelized sugar and black pepper in a noodle kugel known as \"Yerushalmi kugel\" or \"Jerusalem kugel,\" () which is a commonly served at Shabbat kiddushes and is a popular side dish served with cholent during Shabbat lunch.\n\nIn Romania, this dish is called \"Budinca de macaroane\" (\"macaroni pudding\") or \"Baba acolo\". It is made with or without cheese, but almost always includes raisins. In Transylvania, especially in the Hungarian-speaking regions, a very similar dish is called \"Vargabéles\". \n\nSavory kugel may be based on potatoes, matzah, cabbage, carrots, zucchini, spinach or cheese.\n\nA similar traditional Belarusian dish is potato babka.\n\nIn Lithuania, this dish is called Kugelis. It is baked potato pudding and it is a traditional Lithuanian dish. The main ingredients are potatoes, onions, and eggs. It may be spiced with salt, black pepper, bay leaves, and/or marjoram.\n\nKugels are a mainstay of festive meals in Ashkenazi Jewish homes, particularly on the Jewish Sabbath and other Jewish holidays or at a Tish. Some Hasidic Jews believe that eating kugel on the Jewish Sabbath brings special spiritual blessings, particularly if that kugel was served on the table of a Hasidic Rebbe.\n\nWhile noodle kugel, potato kugel, and other variations are dishes served on Jewish holiday meals, matzo kugel is a common alternative served at Passover seders which is adjusted to meet Passover kosher requirements.\n\nAmong South African Jews, the word \"kugel\" was used by the elder generation as a term for a young Jewish woman who forsook traditional Jewish dress values in favor of those of the ostentatiously wealthy, becoming overly materialistic and over groomed, the kugel being a plain pudding garnished as a delicacy. The women thus described made light of the term and it has since become an amusing rather than derogatory slang term in South African English, referring to a materialistic young woman.\n\n\n"}

It is obtained by cooking fruit such as strawberries, apricots, peaches, apples, rhubarb, gooseberries, or sour cherries in a large volume of water, often together with sugar or raisins as additional sweeteners. Sometimes different spices such as vanilla or cinnamon are added for additional flavor, especially in winter when kompot is usually served hot.\n\nKompot is part of the culinary cultures of many countries in Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Northern Europe such as Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, Estonia, Hungary, Iran, Slovenia, Croatia, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Slovakia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, East Germany, Austria and Romania, (where it is known as \"compot\"). Kompot (\"компот\" in Macedonian, Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Bosnian and Ukrainian) was a widely used way of preserving fruit for the winter season in Central and Eastern European countries. In 1885, Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa wrote in a recipe book that kompot preserved fruit so well it seemed fresh. Kompot was still popular in the 1970s. It is still popular in many Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and also in Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and in other Central and Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Dozens of recipes may be found in the Polish recipe book, \"Kuchnia Polska\".\n\nThe consumption of kompot has been declining since the 1980s. With the end of rationing in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe, kompot has been supplanted by fruit juice, soft drinks, and mineral water.\n\nUzvar or vzvar is a similar drink prepared from various dried fruits and sometimes berries sweetened with honey or sugar.\n\n"}

The cake is slowly baked until the butter puffs up the dough (resulting in the layered aspect of it) and the sugar caramelizes. The effect is similar to a muffin-shaped, caramelized croissant.\n\nKouign-amann is a specialty of the town of Douarnenez in Finistère, Brittany, where it originated around 1860. The invention is attributed to Yves-René Scordia (1828–1878).\n\nThe strict recipe of Douarnenez requires a ratio of 40 percent dough, 30 percent butter, and 30 percent sugar. Traditionally, kouign-amann is baked as a large cake and served in slices, although recently, especially in North America, individual cupcake-sized pastries (kouignettes) have become more popular.\n\nThe name derives from the Breton language words for cake (\"kouign\") and butter (\"amann\").

{"id": "1173010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1173010", "title": "Hokkien mee", "text": "Hokkien mee\n\nHokkien mee is a Southeast Asian dish, popular in Malaysian and Singaporean cuisines, that has its origins in the cuisine of China's Fujian (Hokkien) province. In its most common form, the dish consists of egg noodles and rice noodles stir-fried with egg, slices of pork, prawns and squid, and served and garnished with vegetables, small pieces of lard, sambal sauce and lime (for adding the lime juice to the dish).\n\nThere are three distinct types of \"Hokkien mee\", with each being ubiquitous in specific localities in Singapore and Malaysia.\nWhile both the Penang and Singapore versions are commonly known as \"hae mee\" (), and consist of prawns as their main ingredients, the two variants are prepared differently. The Singapore hae mee is stir fried and has a lighter colour, while the Penang variant is cooked in a prawn-based spicy broth.\n\nOn the other hand, Hokkien char mee, which is more common in central Peninsular Malaysia and particularly the Klang Valley, was originally developed in Kuala Lumpur. By default in the Klang Valley, the term \"Hokkien mee\" refers to this darker, stir fried variant. The Penang variant is sometimes referred to as \"mee yoke\".\n\nThe Penang variant can be easily distinguished from the other variants by its characteristic spicy prawn broth. It primarily consists of rice vermicelli and thicker yellow egg noodles, while the broth is made with prawn heads and shells, and pork ribs. Sliced prawns are also added into the dish, along with pork slices, hard boiled eggs, \"kangkung\" (\"Ipomoea aquatica\"), bean sprouts, fried shallots, lard and \"sambal\". In Penang, pig skin, an ingredient rarely served in Kuala Lumpur, is a common topping as well.\n\nIn local parlance, Penang Hokkien mee is known by Penangites simply as \"Hokkien mee\", while the Kuala Lumpur stir fried variant is called \"Hokkien char\". Penang Hokkien mee is particularly ubiquitous in Penang, as it is served by hawker stalls and \"kopitiams\" (traditional Chinese coffee shops) throughout the state.\n\nThe Singaporean version of Hokkien mee was created after World War II by Chinese sailors from Fujian (Hokkien) province in southern China. After working in the factories, they would congregate along Rochor Road and fry excess noodles from the noodle factories over a charcoal stove. Today, this dish, as served in Singapore and neighbouring Malaysian state of Johor, is a stir-fried dish of egg noodles and rice noodles in a fragrant stock. A flavourful stock is essential for a great tasting dish, and is usually made from stewing prawn heads, meat, clams and dried fish.\n\nIt is most commonly garnished with prawns, fish cake, pork ribs, squid, spring onions or chives. Traditionally, small cubes of fried lard are added, but this is now less common and have been substituted with chicken lard due to health concerns. Certified Halal Hokkien mee uses chicken and consists of no pork or pork lard, allowing it to be enjoyed by the Muslim community. Sambal chilli and lime are also standard toppings for this dish, giving it an extra zing and tanginess. Some stalls also serve the dish on an \"Opei\" leaf (soft palm bark), which enhances the fragrance of the dish.\n\nAnother version also referenced as prawn noodles in Singapore is similar to the Penang variation of Hokkien Mee. Egg noodles and rice noodles are served in richly flavoured dark soup stock with prawns, pork slices, fish cake slices, and bean sprouts topped with fried shallots and spring onion. The stock is made using dried shrimps, prawn heads, white pepper, garlic and other spices.\n\n\"Hokkien char mee\" (Hokkien fried noodles; ) is served in Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding region. It is a dish of thick yellow noodles braised in thick dark soy sauce with pork, squid, fish cake and cabbage as the main ingredients and cubes of pork fat fried until crispy (sometimes pork liver is included). The best examples are usually cooked over a raging charcoal fire. This dish originated from a hawker stall chef Ong Kian Lee in the 1920s.\n\n\n\n"}

Ketel One Vodka is distilled from 100% wheat in copper pot stills, filtered over loose charcoal, and rests in tile lined tanks until ready. Ketel One Vodka is named after the original copper pot still, \"Distilleerketel #1.\" The alcohol content of this spirit is 40% (80 proof (US), 70 degrees proof (international)). The Nolet Distillery also makes Ketel One Citroen, Ketel One Oranje, and Ketel 1 Jenever.\n\nKetel One is produced by the Nolet Distillery in Schiedam, the Netherlands. The Nolet Distillery was founded in 1691, and has remained in the Nolet family ever since. Ketel One is so named for the original coal-fired copper still that was used to distill it, Distilleerketel #1.\n\nIn 1794 a windmill known as \"the Whale\" was built on the property. In 1867 the family began to focus on exporting their products. They opened a distillery in the United States in 1902 and sold vodka under the Imperial Eagle Vodka brand name. However, they were forced to close it during the prohibition era, with Joannes Nolet forced to flee the country.\n\nThe town of Schiedam has long been known for the alcohol industry. Currently it has a distillation museum. By the end of the 1800s the town boasted over 400 distilleries. However, the industry was hit hard by World War II, and by the end of the war only 40 were left. Within the next few years changes in technology and consolidations and mergers left Nolet as the only distillery still operating in Schiedam.\n\nWhen Carolus Nolet, the tenth generation of the family to own the company, took over for his father in 1979, the company made a wide range of spirits. However, he made the decision to focus on one product, and make it the best it could be. The company began producing jenever exclusively. Ketel 1 Jenever quickly became the best selling Jenever brand in the Netherlands. At that point the company began to look at returning to the United States market. Carolus began to develop a vodka designed specially for the American market, focusing on quality. \n\nNolet returned to the U.S. market in 1983, launching Ketel One Vodka in San Francisco at the BIX Restaurant and Supper Club. Rather than advertising directly to consumers, the company encouraged bartenders and distributors to sell their product. In 1991 Carl Nolet Jr. moved to the U.S. and founded Nolet Spirits USA. Between 2000 and 2010 the company released two flavored vodkas, Ketel One Citroen and Ketel One Oranje.\n\nSales of Ketel One increased from 7,000 cases in 1992-1993 to 250,000 cases world wide in 1997 and one million cases in 2002. In 2003 the company launched its first advertising campaign, thanking Ketel One drinkers. By 2008 the company was selling close to two million cases per year.\n\nIn 2008, Diageo announced an investment of $900 million in a joint venture with the owners of Ketel One, with the Nolet family continuing ownership of the distillery in Schiedam. \n\nIn 2009 the brand attracted attention for its first television commercials, which seemed \"tailor-made\" for the post-2008 recession economy. Despite being sold in 25 countries, up until 2008 the United States was the only country where the company advertised.\n\nIn 2014, \"The New York Times\" cited the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index as having the Ketel One brand at number 2, behind only Grey Goose among vodkas.\n\n"}

The fungus must be removed from the tree, the hard outer layer scraped off, and then thin strips of the inner spongy layer cut for use as tinder.\n\nAmadou was a precious resource to ancient people, allowing them to start a fire by catching sparks from flint struck against iron pyrites. Remarkable evidence for this is provided by the discovery of the 5,000-year-old remains of \"Ötzi the Iceman\", who carried it on a cross-alpine excursion before his death and subsequent ice-entombment.\nAmadou has great water-absorbing abilities.

Despite its name, there is in fact no tea in the dish itself; the name refers to a strong oolong Chinese tea which is usually served alongside the soup in the belief that it dilutes or dissolves the copious amount of fat consumed in this pork-laden dish.\n\nHowever, additional ingredients may include offal, varieties of mushroom, choy sum, and pieces of dried tofu or fried tofu puffs. Additional Chinese herbs may include \"yu zhu\" (玉竹, rhizome of Solomon's Seal) and \"ju zhi\" (buckthorn fruit), which give the soup a sweeter, slightly stronger flavor. Light and dark soy sauce are also added to the soup during cooking, with varying amounts depending on the variant - the Teochews version is lighter than the Hokkiens'. The dish can be garnished with chopped coriander or green onions and a sprinkling of fried shallots.\n\nIn Malaysia, it is often served with strips of fried dough called you char kueh (or 油條, 油条, youtiao, in Mandarin). Soy sauce (usually light soy sauce, but dark soy sauce is also offered sometimes) is preferred as a condiment, with which chopped chilli padi and minced garlic is taken together. Tea of various kinds, for example the Tieguanyin (鐵觀音, 铁观音) variety which is popular in the Klang Valley area of Malaysia, is also usually served in the belief that it dilutes or dissolves the copious amount of fat consumed in this pork-laden dish.\"Bak kut teh\" is typically eaten for breakfast, but may also be served as lunch. The Hokkien and Teochew are traditionally tea-drinking cultures and this aspect runs deep in their cuisines.\n\n\"Bak-kut-teh\" is commonly consumed in both Malaysia and Singapore. The origin of \"Bak-kut-teh\" is unclear, but it is believed to have been brought over from Fujian, China. In Malaysia, the dish is popularly associated with Klang, where the locals believe it to be the place of origin of \"bak kut teh\". There are a number of claims for the invention of the dish; one claimed that a local \"sinseh\" (a Chinese physician) invented the dish in the 1930s, while another claimed he brought the recipe from his hometown Fujian, China, in the 1940s. The dish is also claimed to have been invented in Port Klang for coolies working at the port to supplement their meagre diet and as a tonic to boost their health in the early 20th century. The dish was popular among early Chinese immigrants, many of whom had also come from Fujian.\n\nThe Teochew variant was developed in Singapore and was sold in the Clarke Quay and River Valley areas after World War II. By the 1960s, \"bak kut teh\" had become a popular street fare in Singapore. Certain business has been focused mainly on serving this dish, and developed their business from humble pushcart into a restaurant chain.\n\nThe Chinese word \"bak\" (肉), which means \"meat\" (or more specifically pork), is the vernacular pronunciation in Hokkien, but not in Teochew (which pronounced it as \"nek\"), suggesting an original Hokkien root.\n\nThe question of its origin has been the subject of a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore; in 2009, the tourism minister of Malaysia, Ng Yen Yen, claimed that \"bak kut teh\" is a dish of Malaysian origin, and that neighbouring countries had \"hijacked\" many of Malaysia's original dishes.\n\nThere are numerous variants of \"bak kut teh\" with its cooking style closely influenced by the prevailing Chinese enclave of a certain geographical location.\n\nThere are three types of \"Bak Kut Teh\".\n\nThe main visual difference between the Hokkien and Teochew version of \"bak kut teh\" is that the Hokkiens use more dark soy sauce and thus the soup base is characteristically darker in colour.\n\nIn addition, a \"dry\" form of \"bak kut teh\" has also recently become increasingly popular within Malaysia, especially in Klang town. Although called \"dry\", the broth is in fact reduced to a thicker gravy, to which other ingredients such as wolfberries, dried dates, dried chillies and dried squid are added. Unlike the original rib soup, the \"dry\" version has a tangier, sharper taste and is more akin to a herbal stew than the classical broth. It is often recommended locally in Malaysia as an excellent hangover cure.\n\nIn Malaysia, a less fatty variation of \"bak kut teh\" made with chicken instead of pork is called \"chik kut teh\". It also serves as a \"halal\" version of the dish catered to Muslims, whose religion forbids them to consume pork.\n\nVegetarian bak kut teh also can be found in Malaysia. Instead of using pork or chicken, oyster mushroom is used.\n\nOn November 22, 2008, the Malaysian Klang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCCI) collaborated with five \"bak kut teh\" sellers in Klang to cook the world's biggest bowl of \"bak kut teh\". The bowl was 182.88 cm in diameter and 91.44 cm in height, and contained 500 kg of pork, 450 kg of soup and 50 kg of herbal medicine, and has been listed in the Malaysian Book of Record.\n\n"}

In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushroom may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\n\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. Always in Sweden and sometimes in Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces or plain sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, it is a popular plate, where the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of cigar. It is usually served with a side of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\n\nThe version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah, stuffed cabbage is described by Gil Marks to have entered Jewish cooking some 2,000 years ago. Recipes vary depending on region; Romanians and northern Poles prefer a savory sauce, while Galicia and Ukraine favor sweet-and-sour, for example.\n\nStuffed cabbage leaves () are popular all year round in Azerbaijan, but especially in the winter months when other vegetables are less available. The stuffing usually consists of rice and herbs such as coriander, mint and dill, onions and meat, although there is a variation – yalanchi (fake) dolma, which is meat-free.\n\nSarmale are Romanian stuffed cabbage rolls traditionally served on Christmas and New Year's Eve but also served throughout the year at weddings, baptism parties, and other large celebrations. Ground pork is mixed with sauteed caramelized onions and rice stuffed in a cabbage leaf, pickled sauerkraut leaf or grape leaf. For flavor, they usually consist of layers with smoked pork fat, smoked ribs, or smoked sausage.\n\nThe Romanian sarmale is a versatile dish, and the best way of consuming is reheated the next day. The flavor is different with an enhanced flavor. It can be prepared with a tomato base, dill base or combination. Sweet shredded cabbage layers in between the rolls of pickled cabbage leaves or sauerkraut layers in between of sweet cabbage leaves. The taste is significant different but still a great dish.\n\nStuffed cabbage rolls are a popular Polish dish. Pork and beef mixed with rice or barley are nestled in a cabbage leaf and cooked in the oven or on the stove until tender.\n\nThe name \"gołąbki\" means \"little pigeons\" in Polish. The cabbage rolls are called \"holubky\" by Czechs and Slovaks, or \"sarma\" by Serbs and Croatians. The sauce is often the main difference in regional variations.\nIn a less popular version called \"leniwe gołąbki\" (lazy cabbage rolls) the ingredients are chopped, combined together and baked or fried.\n\nIn Ukraine, the filling of \"holubtsi\" varies throughout the country. In the Carpathian region corn grits are used, whereas in the Poltava area buckwheat groats are preferred. The cereal is lightly cooked, mixed with fried onions, shkvarky (pork cracklings) or raw minced meat. The mixture is combined with spices and seasonings, and is then used as the filling for steamed fresh or pickled cabbage leaves. In spring cabbage leaves are often replaced with fresh beetroot leaves, and in the southwest – with fresh young grape leaves. The \"holubtsi\" are lightly fried and then stewed with tomato, mushroom sour cream or some other sauce. During Lenten periods this might be water mixed with kvas, while at other times it might be a meat broth.\n\nIn Left Bank Ukraine and in the south, \"holubtsi\" are usually big, made from the entire cabbage leaf, while in the Dniester region and the Carpathians the cabbage leaf is divided into several pieces. In the latter regions, cooks who made large holubtsi were considered lazy. In Poltava cooks preferred the large holubtsi because they were juicier. In most of Ukraine holubtsi were an everyday dish, but in most of Right Bank Ukraine, with the exception of Polissia, they were also included in holiday meals. Beginning in the 1920s, holubtsi began to be stuffed with a rice-meat mixture, and, instead of kvas, they began to be cooked in tomato juice, sauce or paste. This is the most common way they are prepared nowadays.\n\nHolubtsi are a popular dish for both everyday meal and as special occasion treat. For Sviata Vecheria (Christmas Eve Supper) in many regions of Ukraine holubtsi constitute one of the twelve traditional dishes served on the night. Only Lenten ingredients are used in this case. On occasion of Sviata Vecheria, Boykos and Transcarpathians make Holubtsi from \"kryzhavky\" (pickled whole heads of cabbage). Into these \"pickled\" holubtsi they put a stuffing of rice and mushrooms. Carpathian-style holubtsi are usually made from fresh cabbage and stuffed with corn grits, or with grated raw potato (Vorokhta, Verkhovyna, Kvasy). These are best served with mushroom gravy. To differentiate the different types of holubtsi, they are wrapped into different shapes: corn-filled ones are made into the shape of envelopes, with the edges folded in, potato-filled are simply rolled up. A classic Halychian (Galician) dish Sviat Vechir dish is holubtsi stuffed with grated potato and served with a mushroom machanka (dipping sauce).\n\nThe traditional Hungarian cabbage roll (töltött káposzta) can be made from sweet or sauerkraut cabbage leaves, filled with a mixture of minced pork meat, eggs and rice seasoned with dill, cumin, salt, pepper. The Hungarian version often contains minced pepper (paprika) and is served with sour cream on top. Hungarians serve this food during Christmas and New Year's Eve, but it is a common dish throughout the year (sweet version during summer/fall and the sour during winter/spring time). The sour stuffed cabbage is part of the traditional Hungarian pig slaughter menu, and it is said that eating this during the holiday season will bring you wealth (the pig brings good luck) and health (the sauerkraut is filled with Vitamin C) for the new year.\nKåldolmar are Swedish cabbage rolls filled with minced pork and in some cases rice. They are usually eaten with boiled or mashed potatoes, gravy, and lingonberry jam. Kåldolmar are also popular in Denmark and in Finland, where they are known in Finnish as kaalikääryle (plural kaalikääryleet).\n\nThe dish is considered a variety of the dolma, common in Eastern Mediterranean countries. After losing the Battle of Poltava in 1709 Charles XII of Sweden fled to the city of Bender, in Moldavia, then controlled by his ally, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Charles XII spent more than five years in the Ottoman Empire, trying to convince the Sultan to help him defeat the Russians. When he finally returned to Sweden in 1715, he was followed by some of the Ottoman creditors from whom he had borrowed money to finance his wars. The creditors lived in Stockholm until 1732, and during this time it is most likely that the dolma was introduced in Sweden.\n\nThe first known Swedish recipe for Oriental dolmas was included in a famous Swedish cookbook written by Cajsa Warg, in 1765. At the end of the recipe, Ms Warg suggested that those who could not afford vine leaves could use preboiled cabbage leaves in their place.\n\nIn Sweden \"Kåldolmens dag\" (Day of the Cabbage Roll) is celebrated on November 30, the day of the death of Charles XII of Sweden. It was instated in 2010 as a reaction to the recent rise in anti-immigration views by showing the purported long history of a multifaceted Swedish cultural heritage, involving national symbols with international background. It is arranged by \"Kåldolmens vänner\" (Friends of the Cabbage Roll).\n\nNowadays, frozen \"Kåldolmar\" are sold in most big food stores.\n\nThe Russian version of cabbage rolls usually consists of mincemeat mixed with cooked rice or buckwheat wrapped in cabbage leaves and stewed in a mixture of sour cream and tomato sauce. In order to save time there is another variation of that dish called \"lenivye golubtsy\" (lazy cabbage rolls). In that case, the cabbage is chopped and mixed with mincemeat and rice so there is no need to wrap every meatball in a cabbage leaf.\n\nCabbage rolls are a staple diet of the population in Serbia and Croatia. Leaves of brined cabbage stuffed with ground beef with rice is a favorite during Christmastime and other non fasting holy days, while meat is omitted or substituted with crushed walnuts on fasting holy days. Traditionally cabbage rolls are simmered long in a paprika based sauce with chunks of smoked bacon.\n\nIn the Levant, namely Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan (Arab-Speaking Regions), cabbage rolls are called محشي ملفوف Malfoof mahshi. Traditionally the cabbage rolls consist of meat and rice but have vegetarian variants oftentimes cooked as part of a Lenten menu. Local traditions vary between cooking the rolls in a tomato sauce or in a lemon brine.\n\nIn Egyptian cuisine, cabbage rolls are called محشي كرمب, pronounced \"maḥshī kromb\" or \"maḥshī koronb\" (as Standard Arabic [m] often turns to [n] in proximity to [b] in Egyptian Arabic), literally translating to \"stuffed cabbage\". The leaves are fresh and commonly cut into smaller pieces and partially pre-cooked. The most common filling is a mixture of rice, onion, tomato, herbs, and spices (most typically including mint, dill, and cumin); meat is rarely used in Egyptian stuffed cabbage. The rolls are arranged in a pot and boiled in broth or tomato-based sauce, also including the herbs and spices. As the pieces of cabbage and therefore the rolls are small, the leaves are usually simply rolled around the filling almost like a small cigar, and are left open at the ends rather than folded around the filling to produce a completely enclosed package.\n\nIn regions heavily influenced by Polish immigrants, such as Chicago which claims the largest Polish population outside of Poland, Detroit, Pennsylvania, the southern tier of New York, and northeastern Ohio, the term usually refers instead to stuffed cabbage rolls, such as the Polish gołąbki. In some places these are known as \"pigs in a blanket\". Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe popularized the dish in New York City, where they became known as \"Jewish Cabbage\".\n\nCabbage rolls also feature prominently in the cuisines of Cajuns and Louisiana Creoles of southern Louisiana, where they usually take the form of ground pork mixed with rice and chopped vegetables stuffed into parboiled cabbage leaves and cooked in a tomato sauce-based liquid.\n\n\n"}

The brand's motto was \"The Aristocrat of Them All\" (sometimes rendered as \"The Aristocrats of Them All\" when advertised with Smith Bowman Distilleries' Fairfax County Bourbon).\n\nVirginia Gentleman is an 80-proof (40 percent alcohol) whiskey. The distillery also offers a 90-proof small batch version. Both are triple-distilled. \n\nVirginia Gentleman's producer, A. Smith Bowman Distillery, was founded in 1934 by Abram Smith Bowman and his sons, Smith and DeLong. It was originally based on the Bowman family's Sunset Hills Farm in Fairfax County, Virginia, in what later became the planned community of Reston. In 1988, it relocated to Spotsylvania County, near Fredericksburg, into the former FMC Corp. cellophane plant. The distillery used to be an independent family operation, but it has been owned since 2003 by the Buffalo Trace Distillery of Frankfort, Kentucky, which provides the unfinished distillate that becomes Virginia Gentleman. (Buffalo Trace is itself a unit of Sazerac Company, an international beverage corporation based in Metairie, Louisiana.) The company has since expanded its production into hot sauces and barbecue sauces under the Virginia Gentleman label.\n\nVirginia Gentleman's former label depicted a Revolution-era scene of two white men being served by a black footman (presumably a slave), all three in aristocratic dress, standing in front of a plantation-style manor. By at least the 1970s the label was redesigned with the black footman becoming white. Virginia Gentleman's motto, \"The Aristocrat of Them All\", was discontinued some time after, at least from appearing on the label. The label as of 2014 depicted three men in a similar arrangement, none of which are black or a servant.\n\n"}

Runzas can be baked into various shapes such as a half-moon, a rectangle, a round (bun), a square, or a triangle. The runzas sold by the Runza restaurant chain are rectangular while many of the bierocks sold in Kansas are round buns.\n\nThe runza is a regional cuisine of Nebraska, with some commentators calling it \"as Nebraskan as Cornhusker football.\" It is served by the Nebraska Society of Washington, D.C. and the Nebraska Society of New York at their Taste of Nebraska events and was chosen to represent the state at Flavored Nation, an event serving iconic dishes from all fifty states.\n\nThe runza sandwich is said to originate from pierogi, dumplings filled with savory ingredients popular in Eastern Europe, but is more closely related to the similarly-named Russian dish called \"pirozhki\" (literally \"little pies\"). Volga Germans, ethnic Germans who settled in the Volga River valley in Russia at the invitation of Catherine the Great, adapted pirozhki to create the bierock, a yeast pastry sandwich with similar savory ingredients. When the political climate turned against the Volga Germans many emigrated to the United States, creating communities of Germans from Russia across the Great Plains. These immigrants brought their bierock recipes with them, including the Brening family that settled near Sutton, Nebraska. Sarah \"Sally\" Everett (\"née\" Brening), originally of Sutton, is credited with adapting her family's bierock recipe into the runza and also inventing the name for the sandwich. In 1949, Everett went into business selling runzas with her brother Alex in Lincoln.\n\nMany sources agree that Sally Everett invented the name \"runza\" although it is likely she adapted it from an existing name for the sandwich. It could have been the , an older, different German name for the bierock, or it could be from the Low German , meaning belly, alluding to the gently rounded shape of the pouch pastry. The modern German Ranzen, meaning belly, also derives from .\n\nThe word \"runza\" is registered as a trademark in the United States. The trademark is held by the Runza restaurant chain.\n\nRunza (formerly Runza Drive-Inn and Runza Hut) is also the name of a fast food restaurant whose flagship menu item is the runza sandwich. Founded in 1949 by Sally Everett, inventor of the modern runza, the chain began its expansion under Sally's son Donald Everett Sr. in 1966 and started franchising restaurants in 1979. As of November 2018 there are eighty-five Runza restaurants operating, eighty in Nebraska, two in Iowa, two in Kansas and one in Colorado. The restaurant chain is still owned by the Everett family and Sally's grandson Donald Everett Jr. serves as President. In addition to the titular sandwich the chain serves chili and cinnamon rolls (another regional Midwestern dish) and other fast food staples like hamburgers, french fries and onion rings.\n\nThe chain attempted to expand outside of Nebraska in 1989. Executives tried to open a restaurant in the Latvian republic of the Soviet Union, going as far as shipping two hundred frozen runzas to the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture as a part of its negotiations. The deal fell apart after Latvia was invaded by the Soviet government in an attempt to keep it in the Union. Stores did open in the Las Vegas Strip at the Fashion Show Mall's food court and a mall food court in Moline, Illinois but both failed to gain traction and closed within a few years.\n\nRunza, the vendor of the runza sandwiches that are sold at home games for the University of Nebraska in Memorial Stadium, sells over 10,000 sandwiches at each football game. The Temperature Tuesday promotion is held on Tuesdays in the months of January and February. Each store sells runzas to customers at a price equal to the 6:00 A.M. temperature at the store in cents. If the temperature is zero or below the sandwich is free. In 2017, the Omaha Storm Chasers, Omaha's Triple-A baseball team, rebranded themselves as the Omaha Runzas in a cross-promotional event. The team's rebranded uniforms featured a cartoon runza sandwich and shared the green and yellow livery of the Runza restaurant chain. Runza operated a 50s themed Rock n' Roll Runza featuring memorabilia, vintage automobiles and roller skating carhops out of downtown Lincoln from 1991 to 2013.\n\nA Runza restaurant in Papillion, Nebraska received some publicity in 2018 when a newlywed couple ate there after their wedding ceremony. In an interview they explained that the restaurant was prominent to their relationship up to their marriage.\n\nThe Runza restaurant operating out of the Nebraska Union, the student union at the University of Nebraska, closed in 2018 after a decade of operating in the location. Runza was outbid by a combination of two vendors bidding together. There was public outcry from the student body as the runza is strongly identified as a Nebraskan food and students felt that it should be sold at Nebraska's flagship university.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1176512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1176512", "title": "Filet mignon", "text": "Filet mignon\n\nFilet mignon (; French for \"tender fillet\", \"delicate fillet\", or fine fillet\") is a steak cut of beef taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin, or psoas major of the cow carcass, usually a steer or heifer. In French this cut is always called \"filet de bœuf\" (\"beef fillet\") as \"filet mignon\" refers to pork tenderloin. \n\nThe tenderloin runs along both sides of the spine, and is usually harvested as two long snake-shaped cuts of beef. The tenderloin is sometimes sold whole. When sliced along the short dimension, creating roughly round cuts, and tube cuts, the cuts (fillets) from the small forward end are considered to be filet mignon. Those from the center are tournedos; however, some butchers in the United States label all types of tenderloin steaks \"filet mignon\". In fact, the shape of the true filet mignon may be a hindrance when cooking, so most restaurants sell steaks from the wider end of the tenderloin – it is both cheaper and much more presentable.\n\nThe tenderloin is the most tender cut of beef and is also arguably the most desirable and therefore the most expensive. The average steer or heifer provides no more than 500 grams of filet mignon. Because the muscle is not weight-bearing, it contains less connective tissue, which makes it tender. However, it is generally not as flavorful as some other cuts of beef (e.g. primal rib cuts). For this reason it is often wrapped in bacon to enhance flavor, and/or served with a sauce.\n\nThe same cut of beef can also be called:\n\nIn the U.S., both the central and large end of the tenderloin are often sold as \"filet mignon\" in supermarkets and restaurants. The French terms for these cuts are \"tournedos\" (the smaller central portion), \"châteaubriand\" (the larger central portion), and \"biftek\" (cut from the large end known as the \"tête de filet\" (lit. \"head of filet\") in French).\n\nPorterhouse steaks and T-bone steaks are large cuts that include the fillet. The small medallion on one side of the bone is the fillet, and the long strip of meat on the other side of the bone is the strip steak—in Commonwealth of Nations usage, only the strip steak is called the porterhouse.\n\nFilet mignon may be cut into 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5 cm) thick portions, then grilled and served as-is. One also may find filet mignon in stores already cut into portions and wrapped with bacon. High heat is the usual method for cooking the filet mignon, either grilling, pan frying, broiling, or roasting.\n\nBacon is often used in cooking filet mignon because of the low levels of fat found in the cut (see barding), as fillets have low levels of marbling, or intramuscular fat. Bacon is wrapped around the fillet and pinned closed with a wooden toothpick. This adds flavor and keeps the fillet from drying out during the cooking process.\n\nTraditional cooking calls for the filet mignon to be seared on each side using intense heat for a short time and then transferred to a lower heat to cook the meat all the way through. Filet mignon is often served rarer than other meats. Those preferring a more well-done steak can request a \"butterflied\" filet, meaning that the meat is cut down the middle and opened up to expose more of it to heat during the cooking process.\n\n"}

The game is played using a perforated, light-weight, resilient plastic ball and a long, typically yellow, plastic bat.\n\nMiniature versions of baseball have been played for decades, including stickball, improvised by children, using everything from rolled up socks to tennis balls. The ball most commonly used in the game was invented by David N. Mullany at his home in Fairfield, Connecticut in 1953 when he designed a ball that curved easily for his 12-year-old son. It was named when his son and his friends would refer to a strikeout as a \"whiff\". The classic trademarked Wiffle Ball is about the same size as a regulation baseball, but is hollow, lightweight, of resilient plastic, and no more than 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. One half is perforated with eight oblong holes; the other half is non-perforated. This construction allows pitchers to throw a tremendous variety of curveballs and risers. Wiffle balls are typically packaged with a hollow, hard plastic, yellow bat that measures in length and about in diameter.\n\nThe game became popular nationwide by the 1960s, and is played in backyards, on city streets, and on beaches. The game is similar to baseball, and is designed for 2–10 players.\nTournaments have been the driving force in modern wiffle ball and have been held in the United States and Europe since 1977. That year, Rick Ferroli began holding tournaments in his backyard tribute to Fenway Park in Hanover, Massachusetts. In 1980, the World Wiffleball Championship was established in Mishawaka, Indiana by Jim Bottorff and Larry Grau. With the explosion of the Internet in the 1990s, there are now hundreds of Wiffle ball tournaments played in the United States, most in the same place every year, with a few tournament \"circuits\". The World Wiffleball Championship remains the oldest tournament in the nation, having moved to the Chicago suburbs in 2013, after introducing regional stops over three decades in Baltimore; Los Angeles; Indianapolis; Eugene, Oregon; and Barcelona, Spain. The tournament is featured at #27 in the popular book, \"101 Baseball Places to Visit Before You Strike Out.\"\n\nThere is a national fast pitch tournament every summer held in Morenci, Michigan as well. This tournament determines which league is the best in the country. It is called the NWLA Tournament.\n\nThe Super 20 is a list of the top 20 wiffleball teams in the world, which is based on the final results from the World Wiffleball Championship. The current Super 20 is as follows (as of July 16, 2018):\n\n\nSome wiffle ball enthusiasts have taken field construction to inspiring heights, having built fields to resemble major league ballparks. Thomas P. Hannon, Jr. authored a book, \"Backyard Ball\", on his experiences building a smaller version of Ebbets Field. Patrick M. O'Connor wrote a book, \"Little Fenway\", about building his versions of Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. But not all wiffleball fields have been modeled from major league ball parks. Some have created original fields, Strawberry Field in Encino, California being the most exquisite. Rick Messina spent over $700,000 constructing Strawberry Field, which features lights for night games, bleachers, and a press box. He also converted a neighboring house into a clubhouse/pub.\n\nBuilding fields can lead to controversy and legal issues. In 2008, \"The New York Times\" published an article about Greenwich, Connecticut teenagers who were forced by the city to tear down a wiffle ball field they had built because of neighbor complaints.\n\nIn April 2011, the government of the State of New York proclaimed that wiffle ball, as well as kickball, freeze tag and dodgeball were \"unsafe\"\"\" and a \"significant risk of injury\" for children, and declared that any summer camp program that included two or more of such activities would be subject to \"government regulation\". The story became a frequent source of ridicule and amusement, with Parenting.com sarcastically commenting, \"According to new legislation introduced in New York State, to survive classic schoolyard games like capture the flag is to cheat death. Wiffle ball executives originally thought the order was a joke. The company has never been sued over safety issues in its 50+ year history. The disapproval of people from across the nation pressured the New York legislature to remove wiffle ball and many other entries from the list of high-risk activities, such as \"archery\" and \"scuba diving\", that require state government oversight.\n\nWiffle brand products play a central role in \"Wiffle Ball Summer: The Ride of the Elmoron\". The nonfiction title was released in 2011 and details a bicycle journey taken by a man with a wiffle ball bat strapped to his bike frame. The final destination of his journey in the story is a large wiffle ball tournament in Lafayette, Ohio.\n\nIn his book \"The Complete Far Side\", cartoonist Gary Larson reproduces a letter he received after including a \"wiffle bat\" in his cartoon. The letter contains language from Wiffle Ball Incorporated's attorneys: \"In the future, when you use the brand name WIFFLE, the entire brand should be capitalized, and it should only be used in reference to a product currently manufactured by The Wiffle Ball, Inc.\"\n\nIn science, it is frequently used by marine biologists as a size reference in photos to measure corals and other objects.\n\n"}

Made by Mott's, the name is a portmanteau of \"clam\" and \"tomato\". It is also referred to colloquially as \"clamato juice\".\n\nIn 1935 The Clamato Corporation of New York, N.Y. produced \"clam and tomato juice in combination\". \n\nIn 1940, \"Lobster King\" Harry Hackney was granted the Clamato trademark. \nHis Atlantic City restaurant, Hackney's, sold Clamato juice in cans.\nIn 1957, McCormick & Company, Inc. applied for, and later acquired, the Clamato brand name for the seasoned blend of tomato juice and clam juice.\nClamato was produced in its current form beginning in 1966 by the Duffy-Mott company in Hamlin, New York, by two employees who wanted to create a Manhattan clam chowder style cocktail by combining tomato juice and clam broth with spices. Its history extends further back, however, as a nearly identical drink was already present in a cookbook published a decade earlier. The employees named the new cocktail \"Mott's Clamato\" and secured the trademark for the new brand. The brand was owned by Cadbury-Schweppes after the company bought Mott's in 1982. As of 2008, it is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper after the business was spun off of Cadbury-Schweppes.\n\nClamato is used primarily as a drink mix for alcoholic beverages (an estimated 60% of sales in the US in 2008), and it is popular for this in both Canada and Mexico, but less so in the United States (outside of Canadian-American and Mexican-American communities).\n\nClamato is also added to beer in various beer cocktails, such as the michelada; the most basic is known as a \"beer 'n clam\" or a \"Red Eye\" in Western Canada, which adds Clamato to pale lagers. In 2001, Anheuser-Busch and Cadbury-Schweppes introduced a premixed version called the \"Budweiser and Clamato Chelada\" in the United States, which was criticized by American beer critics.\n\nAdding more spices (similar to those in a Caesar) results in what is called \"sangre de cristo\" (blood of Christ) in Mexico.\n\nBeefamato is a similar beverage, but made from beef broth and tomato juice, with a touch of Worcestershire sauce. Beefamato is a popular ingredient in many cocktails, such as \"Gramma's Bloody Mary\".\n\n"}

Vendors often wear traditional clothing of the Ottoman period.\n\nIn some places in Turkey it is customary to treat the ice cream as a Shawarma and cut servings with a butcher knife.\n\nAs of 2010, the average rate of consumption in Turkey was 2.8 liters of ice cream per person per year (compared to the United States at 18.3 liters per person in 2007, and world consumption leader New Zealand at 22–23 liters in 2006).\n\nSome Turks believe that cold foods, such as ice cream, will cause illnesses – such as sore throats and the common cold; it is held that consumption of warm liquid while consuming ice cream will counteract these effects.\n\nThe popularity of \"salepli dondurma\" has caused a decline of wild orchids in the region and led to a ban on exports of \"salep\".\n\nDondurma is also consumed in Greece, especially in the north of the country, where it is called \"dudurmas\" or \"kaimaki\".\n\n\n"}

Since many prefixes and suffixes in English are of Latin or Greek etymology, it is straightforward to add a prefix or suffix from one language to an English word that comes from a different language, thus creating a hybrid word.\n\nHybrids with parts having different origins were formerly often considered to be barbarisms.\n\n\nModern Hebrew abounds with non-Semitic derivational affixes, which are applied to words of both Semitic and non-Semitic descent. The following hybrid words consist of a Hebrew-descent word and a non-Semitic descent suffix:\n\n\nExamples of Modern Hebrew hybrid words with an international prefix include:\n\nSome hybrid words consist of both a non-Hebrew word and a non-Hebrew suffix of different origins:\n\nModern Hebrew also has a productive derogatory prefixal shm-, which results in an 'echoic expressive'. For example, um shmum (), literally 'United Nations shm-United Nations', was a pejorative description by Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, of the United Nations, called in Modern Hebrew \"umot meukhadot\" () and abbreviated um (). Thus, when an Israeli would like to express his impatience with or disdain for philosophy, s/he can say \"filosófya-shmilosófya\" (). Modern Hebrew shm- is traceable back to Yiddish, and is found in English as well as shm-reduplication. This is comparable to the Turkic initial m-segment conveying a sense of 'and so on' as in Turkish \"dergi mergi okumuyor\", literally 'magazine \"shmagazine\" read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd.person.singular', i.e. '(He) doesn't read magazine, journals or anything like that'.\n\nIn Japanese, hybrid words are common in kango – words formed from kanji characters – where some of the characters may be pronounced using Chinese pronunciations (\"on'yomi,\" from Chinese morphemes), and others in the same word are pronounced using Japanese pronunciations (\"kun'yomi,\" from Japanese morphemes). These are known as \"jūbako\" (重箱) or \"yutō\" (湯桶) words, which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are autological words): the first character of \"jūbako\" is read using \"on'yomi\", the second \"kun'yomi\", while it is the other way around with \"yutō\". Other examples include 場所 \"basho\" \"place\" (\"kun-on\"), 金色 \"kin'iro\" \"golden\" (\"on-kun\") and 合気道 \"aikidō\" \"the martial art Aikido\" (\"kun-on-on\"). Some hybrid words are neither \"jūbako\" nor \"yutō\" (縦中横 \"tatechūyoko\" (\"kun-on-kun\")). Foreign words may also be hybridized with Chinese or Japanese readings in slang words such as 高層ビル \"kōsōbiru\" \"high-rise building\" (\"on-on-katakana\") and 飯テロ \"meshitero\" \"food terrorism\" (\"kun-katakana\").\n\n"}

They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course, often for holidays or parties. The dish's origin can be seen in recipes for boiled, seasoned eggs as far back as ancient Rome, where they were traditionally served as a first course. The dish is popular in Europe and in North America.\n\nThe term \"deviled\", in reference to food, was in use in the 18th century, with the first known print reference appearing in 1786. In the 19th century, it came to be used most often with spicy or zesty food, including eggs prepared with mustard, pepper or other ingredients stuffed in the yolk cavity.\n\nIn parts of the Southern and Midwestern United States, the terms \"stuffed eggs\", \"salad eggs\", and \"dressed eggs\" are used instead. The term \"angel eggs\" has also been used in association with fillings with less fat and cholesterol.\n\nCooled hard-boiled eggs are peeled and halved lengthwise, and the yolks are removed. The yolks are then mashed and mixed with a variety of other ingredients, such as mayonnaise and mustard. Tartar sauce or Worcestershire sauce are also sometimes used. Other common flavorings include: diced pickle or pickle relish, salt, ground black pepper, powdered cayenne pepper or chipotle chilies, turmeric, vinegar, ketchup, green olives, pimentos, poppyseed, thyme, cilantro, minced onion, pickle brine, caviar, cream, capers, and sour cream. Contemporary versions of deviled eggs tend to include a wider range of seasonings and added ingredients, such as garlic, horseradish, wasabi, sliced jalapeños, cheese, chutney, capers, salsa, hot sauce, ham, mushrooms, spinach, sour cream, caviar, shrimp, smoked salmon or other seafood, and sardines.\n\nThe yolk mixture is then scooped into each egg \"cup\" made from the firm egg whites. Old Bay, paprika, curry powder, cayenne, chives, or dill may be sprinkled on top as a garnish. The finished eggs may be further decorated with caviar, anchovy, bacon, shrimp, or herring.\n\nIn France, the dish is called \"œuf mimosa\" (\"mimosa egg\", named after the appearance of the mimosa tree); in Hungary, \"töltött tojás\" (\"stuffed egg\") or \"kaszinótojás\" (\"casino egg\"); in Romania, \"ouă umplute\" (\"stuffed eggs\"); in the Netherlands \"gevuld ei\" (\"stuffed egg\"); in Sweden \"fyllda ägg\" (\"stuffed eggs\"); on the island of Malta \"bajd mimli\" (\"stuffed eggs\"). In parts of South America, it is called \"huevos a la peruana\" (\"Peruvian eggs\").\n\nIn many European countries, especially Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a variation is served known as \"Russian eggs\". This consists of eggs cut in half, served with vegetable \"macédoine\" and garnished with mayonnaise, parsley and tomato. Contrary to what the name might suggest, the dish does not originate in Russia; its name derives from the fact that the eggs are served on a bed of \"macédoine\", which is sometimes called \"Russian salad\".\n\nIn Sweden, the deviled egg \"(Fyllda Ägghalvor)\" is a traditional dish for the Easter Smörgåsbord, where the yolk is mixed with caviar, cream or sour cream, optionally chopped red onion, and decorated with chopped chives or dill, perhaps with a piece of anchovy or pickled herring. In French cuisine, the other ingredients are most likely to be pepper and parsley. In Hungarian cuisine, the yolks are mashed and mixed with white bread soaked in milk, mustard and parsley, often served as an appetizer with mayonnaise, or as a main course baked in the oven with Hungarian sour cream topping and served with French fries. Other common flavorings of the yolks in German cuisine are anchovy, cheese and caper.\n\nDeviled eggs are a common dish in the United States. In the Midwestern and Southern U.S., they are commonly served as hors d'oeuvres before a full meal is served, often during the Christmas season. Deviled eggs are so popular in the United States that special trays are sold specifically for serving them. Prepared and packaged deviled eggs are now available in some U.S. supermarkets. While deviled eggs are sometimes sprinkled with Old Bay Seasoning on the east coast, paprika is more commonly used in the south. Deviled eggs are commonly served at Derby parties in Kentucky.\n\n"}

The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak. The top sirloin is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name. The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as \"sirloin steak\". The bottom sirloin in turn connects to the sirloin tip roast.\n\nIn a common British, South African, and Australian butchery, the word \"sirloin\" refers to cuts of meat from the upper middle of the animal, similar to the American short loin, while the American \"sirloin\" is called the rump. Because of this difference in terminology, in these countries, the T-bone steak is regarded as a cut of the sirloin.\n\nThe word sirloin derives from the Middle English \"surloine\", itself derived from the Old French word \"surloigne\" (variant of \"surlonge\"), that is, \"sur\" for 'above' and \"longe\" for 'loin'. In Modern French, the cut of meat is called \"aloyau\" or \"faux-filet\".\nA commonly-repeated anecdote claims that the name is derived from an occasion when King James I of England, while being entertained at Hoghton Tower during his return from Scotland in 1617, was so impressed by the quality of his steak that he knighted the loin of beef, which was referred to thereafter as \"Sir loin\".

Austrian cuisine was formed and influenced by the cuisines of many different peoples during the many centuries of the Austrian Habsburg Empire's expansion. Strudel is related to the Ottoman Empire's pastry baklava, which came to Austria from Turkish via Hungarian cuisine.\n\nStrudel is most often associated with the Austrian cuisine, but is also a traditional pastry in the whole area formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian empire. In these countries, apple strudel is the most widely known kind of strudel. Apple strudel is considered to be the national dish of Austria along with Wiener Schnitzel and Tafelspitz.\n\nApple strudel consists of an oblong strudel pastry jacket with an apple filling inside. The filling is made of grated cooking apples (usually of a tart, crisp and aromatic variety, such as Winesap apples) sugar, cinnamon, and bread crumbs.\n\nStrudel uses an unleavened dough. The basic dough consists of flour, oil (or butter) and salt although as a household recipe, many variations exist.\n\nApple strudel dough is a thin, elastic dough, the traditional preparation of which is a difficult process. The dough is kneaded by flogging, often against a table top. Dough that appears thick or lumpy after flogging is generally discarded and a new batch is started. After kneading, the dough is rested, then rolled out on a wide surface, and stretched until the dough reaches a thickness similar to phyllo. Cooks say that a single layer should be so thin that one can read a newspaper through it. The dough is also stretched carefully to make it large enough to cover the kneading table.\n\nFilling is arranged in a line on a comparatively small section of dough, after which the dough is folded over the filling, and the remaining dough is wrapped around until all the dough has been used. The strudel is then oven baked, and served warm. Apple strudel is traditionally served in slices, sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nIn traditional Viennese strudel the filling is spread over 3/4 of the dough and then the strudel is rolled, incorporating the dough through the filling and making a swirl pattern when the strudel is cut across. Perhaps this is the origin of the name which means whorl or whirlpool.\n\nToppings of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, custard, or vanilla sauce are popular in many countries. Apple strudel can be accompanied by tea, coffee or even champagne, and is one of the most common treats at Viennese cafés.\n"}

Worth area of Texas (in 1999, the name of the tradition was changed to the McFarland Dianic Tradition). McFarland, Roberts, and a third member together formed the Covenstead of Morrigana. According to the McFarland Dianic Homepage, \"It was Mark who pointed out to Morgan the reference to \"Dianic cults\" in Margaret Murray's \"The Witch Cult in Western Europe\". It spoke to their beliefs and practices, and they adopted the name \"Dianic\" for their tradition. Later that year, Mark and Morgan began creating rituals based on the Ogham. McFarland went on to initiate several high priestesses who hived off to start other covens. In 1979 she withdrew as high priestess, and now serves as matriarch and advisor to the Council of High Priestesses of the McFarland Dianic Tradition.\n\nIn 1979 Roberts moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he met a woman named Epona. Roberts taught her the lessons he had written while with McFarland, and Epona became a high priestess and the founder of the \"Eponian\" branch of the McFarland Dianics - what is now known as the Faerie Faith. Roberts most likely took the name for this new tradition from \"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries\" by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, published in 1911 . This book is an oral history and describes a variety of folk beliefs and practices, many still extant at the time the book was written.\n\nRoberts returned to Dallas and started a new tradition, called Hyperborea. Epona continued to teach the Faerie Faith tradition she and Roberts developed, and today there are members of the Faerie Faith spread out across the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Faerie Faith is the use of the Beth-Luis-Nion \"Celtic tree calendar\", allegedly invented by Robert Graves in his book, \"The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth\". The system is based on Graves's controversial re-interpretation of the Celtic ogham alphabet; however, scholars believe Graves's invention is not based on any actual Celtic calendar. In the Faerie Faith, specific lessons are associated with each lunar month, and students experience personal transformation in connection to each tree/letter.\n\n\n"}

A recipe for chess pie appeared in the 1877 cookbook by Estelle Woods Wilcox, Buckeye Cookery.\n\nChess pie is most commonly associated as a dessert of the American South. Common types of chess pie are buttermilk, chocolate, lemon, and nut.\n\nThe origin of the name chess pie is unknown, but many theories have been proposed. It is most likely a mispronunciation of \"cheese pie;\" the combination of eggs, butter, and sugar in chess pie recipes make a custardlike filling that is similar in texture to British cheesecakes and lemon curd. Alternately, it could be named after the town of Chester, England, again due to the similarity to British pies and tarts. The term may also have come from a piece of furniture used prior to home refrigeration called a \"pie chest,\" in which pies were stored. Alternatively, it could have come from a mispronunciation of \"It's just pie” (\"It's jes' pie\").\n\nThe basic chess pie recipe calls for the preparation of a single crust and a filling composed of flour, butter, sugar and eggs. Some variations call for the addition of cornmeal as a stabilizing agent in the filling.

It is popular in Southeast Asia, mainly in Brunei, Indonesia (especially in Palembang), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\n\nThe word for coconut jam in the Malay language, \"kaya\", means rich, referencing the texture of the popular food. It could possibly be an adaptation of the Indian word 'khoya' or 'kova', which is an Indian milk custard used as a base for sweet desserts, as in ancient times the Southern Indians traded extensively with peoples of the Malay Archipelago, thus contributing a fair amount to the cuisine, faith and language of the Austronesians. The \"kaya\" has a custard-like texture like \"khoya\".\n\nTo Malaysians, Indonesians and Singaporeans, kaya, also called srikaya (coconut egg jam), is a sweet creamy coconut spread made from coconut milk (also known as santan) and duck or chicken eggs (which are flavored with pandan leaf and sweetened with sugar). The colour varies depending on the colour of the egg yolks, the amount of pandan, and the extent of the caramelisation of the sugar. As a popular local spread, kaya is typically spread on toast to make kaya toast and eaten in the morning, but is also enjoyed throughout the day. Kaya can be found in most kopitiam and night markets.\n\nDifferent varieties available include the nyonya kaya, which is of a lighter-green colour, and Hainanese kaya, which is a darker brown kind that uses caramelised sugar and is often further sweetened with honey.\n\nIn Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, kaya is also used as a topping for several desserts including \"pulut taitai\" or \"pulut tekan\", a dessert of sweet glutinous rice coloured blue with butterfly pea flowers (\"bunga telang\"), and \"pulut seri muka\", a similar dessert but coloured green due to the pandan leaves ingredient. It is also used with glutinous rice to make \"kuih seri kaya\".\n\nPhilippine coconut jam is known as \"matamís sa báo\", \"matamís na báo\", or \"minatamís na báo\", among other names. The names literally mean \"sweetened coconut\". It is different from other Southeast Asian versions in that it uses coconut cream (\"kakang gata\", the first and second press of grated coconut meat) and cane sugar extract or molasses (treacle). It also does not use eggs and thus is more like syrup rather than custard. It is often eaten on toast or pandesal, used as a filling for pan de coco, and is used to make kalamay. \n\nA less viscous version made with coconut milk (\"gata\") is known as \"latik\" (anglicized as \"coconut caramel\"), and is used in place of syrup in numerous native Filipino desserts.\n\nThe kaya of Thailand is called sangkhaya (, ) in Thai. There are two major types of kaya eaten in Thailand. One type is more liquid than the other, while the less thick kaya is similar to what is eaten in Malaysia and Indonesia. People either spread it on steamed or toasted bread or dip the bread into kaya. This kind of kaya is commonly sold by street vendors but has recently been brought into tea and coffee shops.\n\nAnother type is a concoction that has a less sticky and more custard-like texture. It is sometimes called \"coconut custard\" in English and is used to make \"sangkhaya fakthong\" (, ; \"sangkhaya maryu\" in Lao), sangkhaya pumpkin or custard pumpkin, \"khao niao sangkhaya\" (, ), glutinous rice with sangkhaya, and \"sangkhaya maphrao\" (, ), sangkhaya served in a coconut.\n\n\n"}

Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier.\n\nThey are characterized by a high peak intensity (or more correctly, irradiance) that usually leads to nonlinear interactions in various materials, including air. These processes are studied in the field of nonlinear optics.\n\nIn the specialized literature, \"ultrashort\" refers to the femtosecond (fs) and picosecond (ps) range, although such pulses no longer hold the record for the shortest pulses artificially generated. Indeed, x-ray pulses with durations on the attosecond time scale have been reported.\n\nThe 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ahmed H. Zewail, for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur, opening up the field of femtochemistry.\n\nThere is no standard definition of ultrashort pulse. Usually the attribute 'ultrashort' applies to pulses with a temporal duration of a few tens of femtoseconds, but in a larger sense any pulse which lasts less than a few picoseconds can be considered ultrafast.\n\nA common example is a chirped Gaussian pulse, a wave whose field amplitude follows a Gaussian envelope and whose instantaneous phase has a frequency sweep.\n\nThe real electric field corresponding to an ultrashort pulse is oscillating at an angular frequency \"ω\" corresponding to the central wavelength of the pulse. To facilitate calculations, a complex field \"E\"(\"t\") is defined. Formally, it is defined as the analytic signal corresponding to the real field.\n\nThe central angular frequency \"ω\" is usually explicitly written in the complex field, which may be separated as a temporal intensity function \"I\"(\"t\") and a temporal phase function \"ψ\"(\"t\"):\n\nThe expression of the complex electric field in the frequency domain is obtained from the Fourier transform of \"E\"(\"t\"):\n\nBecause of the presence of the formula_3 term, \"E\"(\"ω\") is centered around \"ω\", and it is a common practice to refer to \"E\"(\"ω\"-\"ω\") by writing just \"E\"(\"ω\"), which we will do in the rest of this article.\n\nJust as in the time domain, an intensity and a phase function can be defined in the frequency domain:\n\nThe quantity formula_5 is the \"intensity spectral density\" (or simply, the \"spectrum\") of the pulse, and formula_6 is the \"phase spectral density\" (or simply \"spectral phase\"). Example of spectral phase functions include the case where formula_6 is a constant, in which case the pulse is called a bandwidth-limited pulse, or where formula_6 is a quadratic function, in which case the pulse is called a chirped pulse because of the presence of an instantaneous frequency sweep. Such a chirp may be acquired as a pulse propagates through materials (like glass) and is due to their dispersion. It results in a temporal broadening of the pulse.\n\nThe intensity functions—temporal formula_9 and spectral formula_5 —determine the time duration and spectrum bandwidth of the pulse. As stated by the uncertainty principle, their product (sometimes called the time-bandwidth product) has a lower bound. This minimum value depends on the definition used for the duration and on the shape of the pulse. For a given spectrum, the minimum time-bandwidth product, and therefore the shortest pulse, is obtained by a transform-limited pulse, i.e., for a constant spectral phase formula_6. High values of the time-bandwidth product, on the other hand, indicate a more complex pulse.\n\nAlthough optical devices also used for continuous light, like beam expanders and spatial filters, may be used for ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor, a device that can be used to control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase \"φ\"(\"ω\") of the input pulse so that the output pulse is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses.\n\nTo accurately control the pulse, a full characterization of the pulse spectral phase is a must in order to get certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).\n\nSeveral techniques are available to measure ultrashort optical pulses. \n\nIntensity autocorrelation gives the pulse width when a particular pulse shape is assumed.\n\nSpectral interferometry (SI) is a linear technique that can be used when a pre-characterized reference pulse is available. It gives the intensity and phase. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from the SI signal is direct. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) is a nonlinear self-referencing technique based on spectral shearing interferometry. The method is similar to SI, except that the reference pulse is a spectrally shifted replica of itself, allowing one to obtain the spectral intensity and phase of the probe pulse via a direct FFT filtering routine similar to SI, but which requires integration of the phase extracted from the interferogram to obtain the probe pulse phase.\n\nFrequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is a nonlinear technique that yields the intensity and phase of a pulse. It is a spectrally resolved autocorrelation. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from a FROG trace is iterative. Grating-eliminated no-nonsense observation of ultrafast incident laser light e-fields (GRENOUILLE) is a simplified version of FROG. (\"Grenouille\" is French for \"frog\".)\n\nChirp scan is a technique similar to MIIPS which measures the spectral phase of a pulse by applying a ramp of quadratic spectral phases and measuring second harmonic spectra. With respect to MIIPS, which requires many iterations to measure the spectral phase, only two chirp scans are needed to retrieve both the amplitude and the phase of the pulse.\n\nMultiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a method to characterize and manipulate the ultrashort pulse.\n\nTo partially reiterate the discussion above, the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) of the electric field of a wave with central wave vector formula_12 and central frequency formula_13 of the pulse, is given by:\nWe consider the propagation for the SVEA of the electric field in a homogeneous dispersive nonisotropic medium. Assuming the pulse is propagating in the direction of the z-axis, it can be shown that the envelope formula_15 for one of the most general of cases, namely a biaxial crystal, is governed by the PDE:\nwhere the coefficients contains diffraction and dispersion effects which have been determined analytically with computer algebra and verified numerically to within third order for both isotropic and non-isotropic media, valid in the near-field and far-field.\nformula_18 is the inverse of the group velocity projection. The term in formula_19 is the group velocity dispersion (GVD) or second-order dispersion; it increases the pulse duration and chirps the pulse as it propagates through the medium. The term in formula_20 is a third-order dispersion term that can further increase the pulse duration, even if formula_19 vanishes. The terms in formula_22 and formula_23 describe the walk-off of the pulse; the coefficient formula_24 is the ratio of the component of the group velocity formula_25 and the unit vector in the direction of propagation of the pulse (z-axis). The terms in formula_26 and formula_27 describe diffraction of the optical wave packet in the directions perpendicular to the axis of propagation. The terms in formula_28 and formula_29 containing mixed derivatives in time and space rotate the wave packet about the formula_30 and formula_31 axes, respectively, increase the temporal width of the wave packet (in addition to the increase due to the GVD), increase the dispersion in the formula_31 and formula_30 directions, respectively, and increase the chirp (in addition to that due to formula_19) when the latter and/or formula_35 and formula_27 are nonvanishing. The term formula_37 rotates the wave packet in the formula_38 plane. Oddly enough, because of previously incomplete expansions, this rotation of the pulse was not realized until the late 1990s but it has been \"experimentally\" confirmed. To third order, the RHS of the above equation is found to have these additional terms for the uniaxial crystal case:\nThe first and second terms are responsible for the curvature of the propagating front of the pulse. These terms, including the term in formula_40 are present in an isotropic medium and account for the spherical surface of a propagating front originating from a point source. The term formula_41 can be expressed in terms of the index of refraction, the frequency formula_42 and derivatives thereof and the term formula_43 also distorts the pulse but in a fashion that reverses the roles of formula_44 and formula_45 (see reference of Trippenbach, Scott and Band for details).\nSo far, the treatment herein is linear, but nonlinear dispersive terms are ubiquitous to nature. Studies involving an additional nonlinear term formula_46 have shown that such terms have a profound effect on wave packet, including amongst other things, a \"self-steepening\" of the wave packet. The non-linear aspects eventually lead to optical solitons.\n\nDespite being rather common, the SVEA is not required to formulate a simple wave equation describing the propagation of optical pulses.\nIn fact, as shown in, even a very general form of the electromagnetic second order wave equation can be factorized into directional components, providing access to a single first order wave equation for the field itself, rather than an envelope. This requires only an assumption that the field evolution is slow on the scale of a wavelength, and does not restrict the bandwidth of the pulse at all—as demonstrated vividly by.\n\nHigh energy ultrashort pulses can be generated through high harmonic generation in a nonlinear medium. A high intensity ultrashort pulse will generate an array of harmonics in the medium; a particular harmonic of interest is then selected with a monochromator. This technique has been used to produce ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray regimes from near infrared Ti-sapphire laser pulses.\n\nThe ability of femtosecond lasers to efficiently fabricate complex structures and devices for a wide variety of applications has been extensively studied during the last decade. State-of-the-art laser processing techniques with ultrashort light pulses can be used to structure materials with a sub-micrometer resolution. Direct laser writing (DLW) of suitable photoresists and other transparent media can create intricate three-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC), micro-optical components, gratings, tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds and optical waveguides. Such structures are potentially useful for empowering next-generation applications in telecommunications and bioengineering that rely on the creation of increasingly sophisticated miniature parts. The precision, fabrication speed and versatility of ultrafast laser processing make it well placed to become a vital industrial tool for manufacturing.\nAmong the applications of femtosecond laser, the microtexturization of implant surfaces have been experimented for the enhancement of the bone formation around zirconia dental implants. The technique demonstrated to be precise with a very low thermal damage and with the reduction of the surface contaminants. Posterior animal studies demonstrated that the increase on the oxygen layer and the micro and nanofeatures created by the microtexturing with femtosecond laser resulted in higher rates of bone formation, higher bone density and improved mechanical stability. \n\n\n\n"}

Varied conditions include absent sexual organs, hermaphrodite and other genetic malformations, or trauma such as amputation or lacerations.\n\nExamples of conditions which may be treated by specialists in this field include:\n\n\nThe medical history of issues related to sexual or reproductive medicine may be inhibited by a reluctance of the patient to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the patient's mind, he or she often doesn't start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or reproductive health. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.\n\n"}

The tradition is believed to have begun among the Germanic peoples as a tribute to Freyr, a god in Germanic paganism associated with boars (see Sonargöltr), harvest and fertility.\n\nAccording to some folklorists and historians the Christmas ham's origins in England lay in a: \"\"tradition [that] was initiated in all probability on the Isle of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons, although our knowledge of it comes substantially from medieval times...[In ancient Norse tradition] sacrifice carried the intent of imploring Freyr to show favor to the new year. The boar's head with apple in mouth was carried into the banquet hall on a gold or silver dish to the sounds of trumpets and the songs of minstrels.\"\"\n\nIn Scandinavia and England, Saint Stephen may have inherited some of Freyr's legacy. His feast day is 26 December and thus he came to play a part in the Yuletide celebrations which were previously associated with Freyr. In old Swedish art, Stephen is shown as tending to horses and bringing a boar's head to a Yuletide banquet. Both elements are extra-canonical and may be pagan survivals.\n\nThe Christmas ham (Yule ham), is often associated with modern Christmas. \n\nSwedes celebrate Christmas in many different ways, and many of the local customs and specialties still survive. A small selection of classic dishes for a Swedish Christmas meal (julbord) include Christmas ham (which is first boiled; then painted and glazed with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs, and mustard; and then baked), pork sausage, an egg and anchovy mixture (\"gubbröra\"), herring salad, pickled herring, home-made liver pâté, wort-flavoured rye bread (\"vörtbröd\"), potatoes, and a special fish dish.)\n\nHam is a traditional Australian dish that features on most tables on Christmas Day. It is cooked and served in many ways all around Australia, with many families adding their own secrets to the ham, making it a special aspect of a Christmas lunch or dinner. \n\nChristmas in Australia comes at the beginning of summer, and many people no longer serve a traditional hot roast dinner. Cold turkey and ham, seafood, and salads are often served instead. Furthermore, the Christmas ham leftovers are often frozen so to make soup and other dishes when the summer is over. \n\n"}

Unlike Australia's other mainland states where vast areas are very sparsely inhabited \"outback\", population centres spread out over most of the state, with only the far north-west and the Victorian Alps lacking permanent settlement. Highways have therefore been built to service the population centres.\n\nThe highways generally radiate from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other.\n\nMost routes have higher traffic than most other states. Highways such as Hume Highway, Western Highway and Princes Highway have some of the heaviest traffic in Australia.\n\nMany of the highways are built to freeway standard (\"M\" freeways), while most others are generally sealed and of reasonable quality.\n\nVictorian highway naming is straightforward. Most are generally named after the geographical regions and features, cities, towns and settlements along the way. Some are even more straightforward e.g. Western and Northern highways which radiate westwards and northwards from Melbourne. Notable exceptions include some interstate highways and some metropolitan highways.\n\nThe numbering system is based on \"ring and spoke\" system. The 'ring' highways (highways that circle Victoria) numbers are given in the multiple of hundreds e.g. Henty Highway (200), Murray Valley Highway (400) and Great Alpine Road (500) make the outermost ring. Midland Highway (300) and Maroondah Highway (300) is the inner ring.\n\nThe spokes generally inherit their original National Route numbers. Otherwise, east-west aligned highways are given even numbers and north-south are given odd numbers. Highways and primary roads are given numbers in multiple of tens.

It is widely known across Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where it is traditionally served fresh, wrapped inside a banana leaf, as well as in many Asian stores internationally — being sold as frozen food. It can be eaten solely as a snack or with steamed rice as part of a meal.\n\n\"Otak\" means \"brains\" in Indonesian and Malay, and the name of the dish is derived from the idea that the dish somewhat resembles brains, being whitish grey, soft and almost squishy.\nNevertheless, only the Indonesian otak-otak has whitish color, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore has reddish-orange or brown coloring acquired from chili, turmeric and curry powder.\n\nOtak-otak is found in certain parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In Indonesia, three cities are famous for their otak-otak; Palembang, Jakarta and Makassar, nevertheless most of coastal fishing towns in Indonesia are familiar with this dish. The southern Malaysian town of Muar in Johor is a popular destination for it — people from surrounding states and even Singaporeans often visit to buy the famous otak-otak in bulk. It is commonly known in Singapore as \"otah\".\n\nOtak-otak is made by mixing fish paste with a mixture of spices. The type of fish used to make otak-otak might vary, mackerel is commonly used in Malaysia, while \"ikan tenggiri\" (wahoo) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as \"bandeng\" (milkfish) and the more expensive \"ikan belida\" (featherback fish) might be used. The ground fish and starch is seasoned with spices which usually includes garlic, shallot, coconut milk, pepper, salt and sugar.\n\nIn Indonesia, the mixture typically contains fish paste, shallots, garlic, scallions, egg, coconut milk, and sago starch or can be substituted for tapioca starch. In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between fish paste, chili peppers, garlic, shallots, turmeric, lemon grass and coconut milk. The mixture is then wrapped in a banana leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed.\n\nIn Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds otak-otak being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. Some of the best otak-otak can be found in Makassar; the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or spanish mackerel.\n\nIn Muar, Malaysia, otak-otak is made from ground fish meat mixed with some spices such as chili, turmeric, and curry powder to add taste. The bones of fishes are first removed as only the fish meat is used, then blended using machine to make it softer. Chili, spices, salt, soy sauce and a little bit of flour are then added to the fish meat and are mixed well. Otak-otak is normally being wrapped inside the \"attap\" (\"Arenga pinnata\") leaves and clipped using stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove.\n\nThe flavor combines the fragrance of burnt \"attap\" leaves, the softness of fish meat and chili spices. The degree of spiciness corresponds to the amount of chilies being used. Since otak-otak is boneless fishcake, it is also suitable for children. While fish otak-otak is most common, otak-otak is also made with prawns, often resulting in a more textured variety. In Muar, there is also otak-otak made from cuttlefish, shrimp, crab meat, fish head and even chicken.\n\nOther than grilling, some otak-otak might be steamed instead. Steamed otak-otak is in rectangular shape without any attap leaves wrapping. Otak-otak are served best freshly hot, as a side dish with rice or as snacks during tea time.\n\nThere are different recipes of otak-otak originating from different regions.\n\nIn Indonesia, otak-otak commonly associated with Palembang, South Sumatra. However, other regions in Indonesia also popular for their otak-otak recipes, such as Jakarta and Makassar. In Palembang, people eat otak-otak with \"cuko\" (Palembangese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce). While in Jakarta, they enjoy it with spicy peanut sauce.\nIn Malaysia otak-otak is commonly found in a small town called Muar, located south of West Peninsular Malaysia, Johor. The otak-otak from Muar is particularly renowned in Malaysia. Nyonya otak-otak (Malay: \"otak-otak Nyonya\"), with Peranakan origins, from the northern Malaysian state of Penang, is steamed as a cake in banana leaf. The otak-otak from Indonesia, the south of Malaysia, and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. The color of otak-otak from Indonesia is whitish, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange. Other varieties of otak-otak do exist. Although otak-otak is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of otak may utilize crab or prawn meat or even fish head.\n\nA type of delicacy similar to otak-otak from Terengganu is called Sata. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called pepes. Other types of otak-otak include dishes called \"pais ikan\", \"botok\" that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves. Otak-otak is quite similar to Szczecin paprikas (). \n\nThe Philippines has a similar delicacy called \"tupig\", which is cooked in the same manner as otak-otak - albeit the former is a sweet version. A thick batter made of glutinous rice flour (known locally as \"galapong\") coconut strips, coconut milk, sugar and nuts is wrapped in banana leaves, and then grilled over coals. \"Tupig\" is a well-known delicacy in the northern Philippine province of Pangasinan.\n\n\n"}

The concept of nascent state has been debunked. Thus, nascent iodine does not exist and medicines purporting to contain this substance are misrepresentations.\n\n\nThe preparation was first conceived in 1931 by American Christian mystic Edgar Cayce in two channelled \"readings\" for an Indian inventor by the name of Shankar Bhise who inquired about how to improve an iodine medicine. Cayce regarded this specially formulated \"atomic\" iodine as far easier to assimilate than other forms. Cayce recommended this atomic iodine or \"Atomidine\" as a therapeutic measure, in over 600 \"readings\". Extracts from some of his readings:\n\n\"This will not only be a curative property, but a preventative … especially for any form of disorder in glands or tissue of body\" (358-2), and \"with the use of this product, a more equal balance is to be gained and maintained in the system—but used properly!\" (358-1) Reiterated throughout this body of information is its purpose, when taken orally, as a gland purifier and cleanser, especially affecting the thyroid, thymus, adrenals, and other ductless glands, and stimulating \"the circulation through lungs, heart, liver and kidneys.\" (3535-1) This reaction upon the glands would create “perfect coordination between the glandular forces of the body” (1933-1) and \"build strength to the whole anatomical condition of the body.\" (1475-1) Another reading stated that \"most glands function as machinery would under oil. The iodine being the oil for the gland, see?\" (294-130). (the numbers that follow each quote from the readings refer to the reading filing code in the A.R.E. files)\n\nCayce gave two separate readings for Shankar Bhise and gave him directions with two different manufacturing methods:\n\n\nToday, Cayce's prescribed \"Atomic iodine\" is made in different ways by different manufacturers, and is generally named nascent iodine, atomic iodine or detoxified iodine, each with different interpretations of the Edgar Cayce readings in which it was first recommended.\n\nSome manufacturers mix nascent iodine with other supplements (such as herbs) in the bottle, which would bond when this free form of iodide is exposed to a positively charged ion, such as sodium or potassium, as it would be in a liquid supplement, it will bind with these to form sodium iodide or potassium iodide, basically nullifying its nascent state.\n\nThe name \"Atomidine\" is an unregistered trademark of The Heritage Store (was a registered trademark between 2001 and 2008). Their formula contains iodine in the form of iodine trichloride and aqueous solution, which is treated with several herbal compounds.\n\nThe name \"Atomic Iodine\" is an unegistered trademark of Baar Products, Inc. Baar is the official Supplier of A.R.E.'s Edgar Cayce Health Care. Baar \"Atomic Iodine\" is made with 1% iodine-trichloride in aqueous solution, with an added proprietary blend of herbs.\n\nThe name \"Magnascent\" is a registered trademark of John Brookshire, owner of the 2004 nascent iodine patent. LL Magnetic Clay \"Nascent Iodine\" is also based on his patent.\n\nIn 1929 the FDA Bureau of Chemistry stated on \"Atomidine\" advertised health claims \"As far as our records go, all of these claims are without a scintilla of printed scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that Atomidine is superior or even the equal to tincture of iodine...\".\n\nBiologist Wojciech Rychlik in an article for orthomolecular.org about iodine supplementation, wrote:\n\nThe diatomic form of elemental iodine I2, has no electrical charge. Monoatomic iodine also has no electrical charge, but is unstable and highly reactive (free radical, labeled as an I with a dot, I* ). It can be produced by exposing I2 to ultraviolet light. Electric and magnetic fields won't do it, as is sometimes incorrectly suggested.I should mention a few points about Edgar Cayce's atomidine. This famous visionary wrote several articles about the best form of iodine supplement (18). Some claim that this was iodine trichloride, but that cannot be true as this compound is toxic by ingestion and damaging to mucous membranes. It decomposes to ICl and poisonous gas Cl2 at 77 degrees C and also in water at room temperature (19). Most likely Cayce's atomidine was simply a 1% iodine solution (I2) in 95% ethanol. I am surprised that there are educated people, even medical doctors who claim that \"elemental monoatomic iodine\" preparations (Atomidine, Nascent Iodine etc.) are the best forms of iodine supplements. May be it has something to do with efficient marketing? Elemental Iodine (I2) is soluble in glycerin. Replacement of ethanol with glycerol indeed makes these supplements more consumption-friendly, so they are sold by some vendors as superior products to Cayce's ethanol-formulated one. Personally, I think glycerol-based I2 supplements are inferior to iodides; however, they are excellent antiseptics.The best and safest form of iodine supplementation for a healthy adult is iodide. Iodides are naturally produced in larger quantities by various seaweeds.\n"}

The purpose of folwarks was to produce surplus produce for export. The first folwarks were created on church- and monastery-owned grounds. Later they were adopted by both the nobility (\"szlachta\") and rich peasants (singular: \"sołtys\"), but the sołtys positions were eventually taken over by the \"szlachta\".\n\nThe term \"\"folwark\"\" came into the Polish language in the 14th century from the German \"\"Vorwerk\"\", originally the fortified advanced work of a castle, later an outlying manor house that managed a farm estate. The English translation would be grange, the historical meaning of which is \"an outlying farm with tithe barns belonging to a monastery or feudal lord\".\n\nCreation of the folwarks was boosted by growing demand for grain and the profitability of its export, both to Western Europe and inside the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This led to the exploitation of serfdom, when land owners discovered that instead of money-based rent and taxes it was more profitable to force the peasantry to work on folwarks. Folwark-based grain export was an important part of the economy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nFolwarks were primarily an early modern, post-feudal rural formation. They originated as land belonging to a feudal lord (early on a knight) and not rented out to peasants but worked by his own hired labor or servants. The peasants toiled on the lots they rented from the lord, but in addition were obliged to provide complimentary labor for the lord on his folwark, originally a few days per year. From the 16th century, the amount of this mandatory free labor was radically increased and \"szlachta\" sponsored legislation imposed rigid conditions on the peasants, such as the prohibition on worker's right to leave a village and seek a new lord. The originally free peasants became serfs, and serfs then fell into a condition of extreme dependency and exploitation, known in Poland as \"wtórne poddaństwo\" [secondary serfdom]. Their lords in turn had become dependent on such slave labor, which kept the folwark economy going and \"competitive\" on the European grain markets.\n\nIn Poland serfdom was regulated (and increased) by the Privilege of Piotrków (1388) and the Privilege of Toruń (1520) (statutory privileges granted by kings to \"szlachta\"). With the fall of prices of agricultural goods at the end of the 17th century, the folwark economy was in crisis, and the \"szlachta\"'s attempts to increase production by increasing the size of their folwarks (usually by appropriating peasant lands) and demanding more labour (usually by increasing the peasant workload) only compounded the economic crisis and further worsened the fate of the peasants, who had been, until then, no poorer than their average counterparts in Western Europe.\n\nIn Lithuania serfdom was fully established during the Volok Reform in the middle of the 16th century.\n\nUntil the end of the 18th century folwarks remained the basis for szlachta economic and political power. After the abolition of serfdom in Poland, folwarks used paid labor.\n\nFolwarks were abolished by the People's Republic of Poland with the Polish Committee of National Liberation decree of 6 September 1944, concerned with agricultural reform. After the end of Second World War folwarks were nationalised, resulting in PGRs – state-owned collective rural enterprises (\"Państwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne\") or partitioned, usually with little or no compensation to their owners.\n\n"}

The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process. Traditionally, it has been naturally fermented over years in \"jangdok\" (earthenware) on an elevated stone platform, called \"jangdokdae\", in the backyard.\n\nThe Sunchang Gochujang Festival is held annually in Gochujang Village in Sunchang County, North Jeolla Province. In 2018, the Sunchang Gochujang Festival will take place in October.\n\nIt has commonly been assumed that spicy \"jang\" () varieties were made using black peppers and \"chopi\" before the introduction of chili peppers. \"Shiyi xinjian\", a mid-9th century Chinese document, recorded the Korean pepper paste as (). The second-oldest documentation of pepper paste is found in the 1433 Korean book \"Collected Prescriptions of Native Korean Medicines\". Pepper paste is again mentioned in a 1445 medical encyclopedia named \"Compendia of Medical Prescriptions\".\n\nChili peppers, which originated in the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders in the early 16th century. The first mention of chili pepper in Korea is found in \"Collected Essays of Jibong\", an encyclopedia published in 1614. \"Farm Management\", a book from ca. 1700, discussed the cultivation methods of chili peppers.\n\nIn the 18th-century books, \"Somun saseol\" and \"Revised and Augmented Farm Management\", gochujang is written as \"gochojang\", using hanja characters and . It is also mentioned that Sunchang was renowned for its gochujang production.\n\nGochujang ingredients reported in \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\" were of powdered and sieved \"meju\" (fermented soybeans), of chili powder, and of glutinous rice flour, as well as soup soy sauce for adjusting the consistency. The gochujang recipe in \"Gyuhap chongseo\", an 1809 cookbook, uses powdered \"meju\" made from of soybeans and of glutinous rice, then adding of chili powder and \"bap\" made from of glutinous rice.\n\nGochujang's primary ingredients are red chili powder, glutinous rice powder, powdered fermented soybeans, and salt. Korean chili peppers, of the species \"Capsicum annuum\", are spicy yet sweet making them ideal for gochujang production.\n\nOther recipes use glutinous rice (\"chapssal\", ), normal short-grain rice (\"mepssal\", ), or barley, and, less frequently, whole wheat kernels, jujubes, pumpkin, and sweet potato; these ingredients are used to make special variations. A small amount of sweetener, such as sugar, syrup, or honey, is also sometimes added. The finished product is a dark, reddish paste with a rich, piquant flavor.\n\nThe making of gochujang at home began tapering off when commercial production came into the mass market in the early 1970s. Now, most Koreans purchase gochujang at grocery stores or markets. It is still used extensively in Korean cooking to flavor stews (\"jjigae\"), such as in \"gochujang jjigae;\" to marinate meat, such as in \"gochujang bulgogi;\" and as a condiment for \"naengmyeon\" and \"bibimbap\".\n\nGochujang is also used as a base for making other condiments, such as \"chogochujang\" () and \"ssamjang\" ().\n\"Chogochujang\" is a variant of gochujang made by adding vinegar and other seasonings, such as sugar and sesame seeds. It is usually used as a sauce for \"hoe\" and \"hoedeopbap\". Similarly, \"ssamjang\" is a mixture of mainly gochujang and \"doenjang\", with chopped onions and other spicy seasonings, and it is popular with \"sangchussam\" ().\n\nGochujang hot-taste unit (GHU) is a unit of measurement for the pungency (spicy heat) of gochujang, based on the gas chromatography and the high-performance liquid chromatography of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin concentrations.\n\nGochujang products are assigned to one of the five levels of spiciness: Mild Hot, Slight Hot, Medium Hot, Very Hot, and Extreme Hot.\nGochujang is used in various dishes such as \"bibimbap\" and \"tteokbokki\", and in salads, stews, soups, and marinated meat dishes. Gochujang may make dishes spicier (depending on the capsaicin in the base chili), but also sweeter and smokier.\n\n"}

An egg roll is a cylindrical, savory roll with shredded cabbage, chopped pork, and other fillings inside a thickly-wrapped wheat flour skin, which is fried in hot oil. The dish is served warm, and is usually eaten with the fingers, dipped in duck sauce, soy sauce, plum sauce, or hot mustard, often from a cellophane packet. Egg rolls are a ubiquitous feature of American Chinese cuisine and are often served as free additions to American Chinese lunch special take-out combination platters throughout the United States, along with fried rice and fortune cookies.\n\nThe origins of the dish are unclear and remain disputed. Egg rolls are closely related to, but distinct from, the spring rolls served in mainland China, and were first seen in the early 20th century in the United States. An early reference to egg rolls appeared in a 1917 Chinese recipe pamphlet published in the United States, but the dish does not resemble the modern egg roll. The 1917 recipe described a meat and vegetable filling wrapped in an egg omelet, panfried, and served in slices, similar to Gyeran-mari.\n\nAndrew Coe, author of “Chop Suey: A Cultural history of Chinese food in the United States\", has stated that the modern American egg roll was probably invented at a Chinese restaurant in New York City in the early 1930s, by one of two chefs who both later claimed credit for the creation: Lung Fong of Lung Fong's, or Henry Low of Port Arthur. According to Coe, Low's recipe, printed in a 1938 cookbook, \"Cook at Home in Chinese\" included “bamboo shoots, roast pork, shrimp, scallions, water chestnuts, salt, MSG, sugar, palm oil, and pepper,” but notably did not include cabbage, which is the main filling ingredient in modern egg rolls.\n\nEgg rolls do not typically contain egg in the filling, and the wheat flour wrapper may or may not contain egg. In addition to the disputed origin of the dish, it is unclear how the word \"egg\" appeared in the name, since the predominant flavor in American egg rolls is cabbage, not eggs. A 1979 Washington Post article speculated that the Chinese word for \"egg\" sounds very similar to the Chinese word for \"spring\", but this theory has not been widely adopted.\n\nWhile there are many types of spring rolls native to East Asia and available in authentic Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai restaurants in the United States, American egg rolls are distinct. A typical \"New York style\" egg roll measures approximately two inches in diameter by six inches in length, with a thick, chewy, crispy, bumpy exterior skin. Egg rolls, like other Americanized Chinese food specialties, may contain vegetable cultivars and flavor profiles that are not common in China, including broccoli.\n\nRestaurants that serve egg rolls occasionally also offer spring rolls as a separate menu option, and these spring rolls may be served with a cold filling wrapped in Banh trang rice paper wrappers (particularly at Vietnamese restaurants that serve both egg rolls and spring rolls as appetizers), or fried, as seen in some Thai and Chinese eateries. When fried, spring rolls served in Asian restaurants in the United States usually have a smaller diameter and a lighter, crispier skin made out of thinner sheets of wheat or rice dough.\n\nIn season 5 episode 5 of \"The King of Queens\", Doug Heffernan participates in an egg roll eating contest at work, despite a warning from his wife not to overeat.\n\nIn the 1968 romantic comedy film \"With Six You Get Eggroll\", a character notes that the combined, albeit chaotic, families of the two romantic leads constitute a party large enough to qualify for free egg rolls when eating out at a Chinese restaurant, a comment from which the film draws its title.\n\nThe 1959 musical \"Gypsy\" includes a song called \"Have an Eggroll, Mr. Goldstone\".\n\nIn season 2 episode 14 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Hoytsman challenges Jake to guess Terry's height in egg rolls.\n\n"}

Available in a variety of forms, the balls may be solid, or contain clappers or chimes within. Other, larger versions made of plastic encasing lesser balls are called Duotone balls. They are used by inserting them into the vagina and using the pubococcygeus muscles to hold them in, stimulating movement and/or vibration. Ben Wa balls should not be confused with anal kegel exercisers and prostate stimulators for men: Ben Wa balls sometimes have a retrieval string or attachment of some sort, but they do not have an adequately flared base for safe anal play.\n\nBen Wa balls have a varied history; their origin and method of construction varies depending upon location. Most information concerning Ben Wa balls is vague and probably apocryphal. Originally they were made of a single ball placed in the vagina, used to enhance the act of sexual intercourse, but then evolved into multiple metal covered balls linked by either a chain or silk string for easy removal. Usage of Ben Wa balls creates a subtle stimulation, not meant to bring the user to immediate orgasm but rather to tease. It is possible to leave Ben Wa balls in one's vagina all day, or use them while seated in a rocking chair, for an effect that some find pleasurable.\n\nBen Wa balls may also be used to simply increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles, much as Taoist sexual practices have been used for centuries and the Kegel exercises are used today. Similar to Kegel exercises, Ben Wa balls and other shaped vaginal weightlifting equipment are recommended by gynecologists and obstetricians to increase vaginal elasticity and bladder control. Vaginal weights come in a spherical shape and are used in increasing weights to strengthen the vagina, which improves sexual performance. Mild urinary incontinence, such as that which occurs while coughing, laughing, or sneezing and occurs more often as women grow older, can be treated with Ben Wa balls, vaginal weights, or Kegel exercise.\n\nPractitioners of such spiritual traditions as Tantra and Chinese Taoism believe that Ben Wa Balls are helpful tools to exercise control and to explore the sensual side of an individual.\n"}

Aside from the traditional moulded pan, commonly found in stores specialising in kitchen equipment and even hardware stores, no special tools are required to make madeleines.\n\nA génoise cake batter is used. The flavour is similar to, but somewhat lighter than, sponge cake. Traditional recipes include very finely ground nuts, usually almonds. A variation uses lemon zest for a pronounced lemony taste.\n\nEnglish madeleines also use a génoise sponge but they are baked in dariole moulds. After cooking, the cakes are coated in jam and desiccated coconut, and are usually topped with a glacé cherry.\n\nSeveral legends are attached to the \"invention\" of the madeleines. They have tended to center on a female character named Madeleine who is said to have been in the service of an important character in the history of Lorraine – although there is no consensus over the last name of the cook nor the identity of the famous character. Some consider that the illustrious patron was 17th-century cardinal and rebel Paul de Gondi, who owned a castle in Commercy. Others consider that the inventor was named Madeleine Paulmier, who is said to have been a cook in the 18th century for Stanislaus I, duke of Lorraine and exiled King of Poland. The story goes that, in 1755, Louis XV, son-in-law of the duke, charmed by the little cakes prepared by Madeleine Paulmier, named them after her, while his wife, Maria Leszczyńska, introduced them soon afterward to the court in Versailles. Much beloved by the royal family, they conquered the rest of France in no time. Yet other stories have linked the cake with the pilgrimage to Compostela, in Spain: a pilgrim named Madeleine is said to have brought back the recipe from her voyage, or a cook named Madeleine is said to have offered little cakes in the shape of a shell to the pilgrims passing through Lorraine.\n\nOther stories do not give the cake a Lorraine origin and lay its invention at the feet of pastry chef Jean Avice, who worked in the kitchens of Prince Talleyrand. Avice is said to have invented the Madeleine in the 19th century by baking little cakes in aspic moulds.\n\nThe term madeleine to describe a small cake seems to appear for the first time in France in the middle of the 18th century. In 1758, a French retainer of an Irish Jacobite refugee in France, Lord Southwell, is said to prepare \"cakes à la Madeleine and other small desserts\".\n\nThe appearance of the madeleine is indicative of the increasing use of metal molds in European baking in the 18th century (see also Canelés), but the commercial success of the madeleine dates back to the early years of the 19th century. Several mentions of the madeleine are made by culinary writers during the Napoleonic era, in particular in the recipe books of Antonin Carême and by famous gastronomer Grimod de la Reynière.\n\nIn Commercy, the production at a large scale of madeleines is said to have begun in the 1760s. In addition to being sold at the Commercy rail station, thus accelerating their spread through the country, is likely that the cakes were exported to Paris along with the marmalade from Bar-le-duc and the croquantes from Rheims. By the end of the 19th century, the madeleine is considered a staple of the diet of the French bourgeoisie.\n\nMadeleines were chosen to represent France in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.\n\nIn \"In Search of Lost Time\" (also known as \"Remembrance of Things Past\"), author Marcel Proust uses madeleines to contrast involuntary memory with voluntary memory. The latter designates memories retrieved by \"intelligence\", that is, memories produced by putting conscious effort into remembering events, people, and places. Proust's narrator laments that such memories are inevitably partial, and do not bear the \"essence\" of the past. The most famous instance of involuntary memory by Proust is known as the \"episode of the madeleine\", yet there are at least half a dozen other examples in \"In Search of Lost Time\".\n\n"}

It was widely cultivated and used for food throughout much of North America by Native Americans, and many tribes on the eastern coast of North America ate mashed pumpkin. Some Native Americans also spread mashed pumpkin over scrapes and cuts as a poultice. Mashed pumpkin was likely served at the 1621 \"First Thanksgiving\" celebration at Plymouth Colony in America, where members of the Wampanoag tribe celebrated an iconic harvest festival with the Pilgrims. English colonists in New England quickly adopted pumpkin as a food source, and \"pumpkin sauce\" (mashed pumpkin) was served at inns in New England as early as 1704. Mashed pumpkin was also added to various breads and cakes as a flavoring agent as well as a sweetener. By the mid-18th century, mashed pumpkin was also being used as an ingredient in pies. In the New World Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (modern New York City), mashed pumpkin was mixed with corn meal and fried as a pancake.\n\nChefs generally recommend steaming when cooking pumpkin to make mashed pumpkin, as boiling in liquid tends to significantly dilute the flavor.

Several Qur'anic verses state that some revelations have been abrogated and superseded by later revelations, which are understood by many Muslim scholars as pertaining to the verses of the Quran itself. Some examples include a gradual ban on consumption of alcohol and a change in qibla (the direction someone praying salat should face) from Jerusalem to Mecca.\n\nWith few exceptions, neither the Quran, nor recorded sayings and doings of Muhammad (known as a hadith) that make up the Sunnah, state \"which\" Quranic verses or ahadith have been abrogated. However narrations from Muhammad's companions mention abrogated verses or rulings of the religion; and the principle of abrogation of an older verse by a new verse in the Quran, or within the Hadiths, was an established principle in Sharia at least by the 9th century. The possibility of abrogation between these two primary sources of Islam (the Quran and Sunnah) has been a more contentious issue. The allowability of abrogation between sources has been one of the major differences between the Shafi'i and Hanafi schools of fiqh (jurisprudence), with Shafi'i forbidding abrogation of the Qur'ān by the Sunnah, and the Hanafi allowing it.\n\nMuslim exegetes and jurists disagree over which and how many ahadith and verses of the Quran are recognized as abrogated, with estimates varying from less than ten to over 500.\n\n\"Naskh\" has been defined as \n\nAccording to some Muslim sources (Quran Academy, Abu Amina Elias, etc. ) the early generations of Muslims (Salaf) \"would often use the word abrogation\" in the sense of \"specification, exception, or clarification,\" rather than totally canceling out a verse.\n\nDescriptions of Naskh by Sunni legal theorists of the tenth and eleventh centuries include: \n\nWords containing the root stem n-s-kh occur four times within the Qur'ān — in verses 7:154, 45:29, 22:52, and 2:106. The first two occurrences come in the context of texts and scribal activity: \"in the writing [\"nuskhah\"] thereon\" (Q.7:154) and \"For We were wont to put on Record [\"nastansikh\"] all that ye did\" (Q.45:29).\n\nThe Quran contains two \"verses of abrogation\", which establish the principle in Islam that an older verse may be abrogated and substituted with a new verse, a principle that has been historically accepted and applied by vast majority of Islamic jurists on both the Quran and the Sunnah.\n\nOther verses believed to indicate the principle of naskh are \n\nAn indication of why (at least) one Quranic verse was abrogated is found in 22:52.\n\nThis verse, cited by Tabarī in connection with the incident of the so-called \"Satanic Verses\", supported an interpretation of \"naskh\" as eradication (\"izāla\") from the \"Mus'haf\" of the Quran and thus made acceptable the idea of \"naskh\" as the nullification of a verse and ruling — \"naskh al-hukm wa-'l-tilāwa\" — without any replacement. According to John Burton, Tabarī's interpretation (\"Tafsīr\"), states that God removed some of the early verses that the devil had cast into the Quran and replaced them in later verses.\n\nIbn Taymiyyah also identified the form of \"naskh\" where a satanic verse (\"something that Satan has managed to insinuate into Revelation through Prophetic error\") is \"canceled\" by a divine one, (which he calls \"al-naw' al-ikharmin al-naskh\").\n\nLater exegetes such as Makkī insist that verse 22:52 does not indicate the Islamic legitimacy of the concept of \"naskh\" for divine revelation but only shows that God eradicated with later recital what the Devil insinuated into the Prophet's recital. These Islamic scholars relegated verse 22:52 of the Quran to merely lexical significance.\n\nMany cases of naskh depend on \"the agreement of scholars\" to determine if a verse was abrogated, and on Tafsir reports or the recollection of Hadith transmitters to explain what verse or prophetic statement was revealed before another. However, one Quranic verse and one hadith specifically mention some earlier command to be abrogated and replaced with another — though they do not use any form of the word \"naskh\".\n\nQuranic verse 2:143-50 commands Muhammad and the Muslims to turn their faces away from 'the direction of prayer that you faced before' (Jerusalem) to a new one, one that 'pleases your heart,' (by which is meant the Al-Haram Mosque of Mecca). In one hadith Muhammad changes an earlier command to his followers: 'I had prohibited you from visiting graves, but visit them, for indeed in visiting them there is a reminder [of death].' \n\nThe scope of the doctrine of \"Naskh\" has been controversial, and some Islamic scholars (a minority) disagree with its premise, usage and applicability.\nThe Quran was revealed by Muhammad over 23 years, while sunnah in the Hadiths traditionally are held as the sayings and practices of Muhammad over this same period. From the early period of Islam's history, scholars noted that certain early verses and later verses covered the same topic, but were contradictory in their requirements. The contradictory commands exist in the Quran, among ahadith of the sunnah, as well as between verses of the Quran and the ahadith of the sunnah.\n\nSince \"a defining claim of Sunni Islam\" is that no two authentic hadith could contradict each other or the Quran (and nothing in the Quran could contradict anything else in the Quran), scholars worked to resolve these apparent contradictions.\n\nWorking with ahadith, scholars first strove to “harmonize” these, i.e. to make them fit together by reinterpreting them. If that failed they would look for signs of abrogation (that one saying/doing/inaction by Muhammad was earlier than the other and had been replaced by the later saying/doing/inaction). \nIf there was no opportunity for abrogation, they would check the \"isnad\"—chains of transmission of the ahadith—to see if the transmission of one hadith was superior to another. Finally, if the \"isnad\" were not different they would approve the hadith that seemed \"closest to the overall message of the Quran and Sunnah\".\n\nPreachers argue that different situations encountered over the course of Muhammad's more than two decade term as prophet required new rulings to meet the Muslim community's changing circumstances. (Or, since God is all knowing, the expiration points of those rulings God intended as temporary all along were reached.) \nJ.A.C. Brown calls \"Naskh\" an expression of “the notion that aspects of the Quran’s message and the Prophet’s teachings developed over time\". Abu Amina Elias states that naskh is a recognition \"that one rule might not always be suitable for every situation. Far from Allah changing his mind, abrogation demonstrates the wisdom of Allah in legislating rules for their appropriate time and context. For most rules in Islam, there exist circumstances that warrant an exception to the rule.\"\n\n\"Naskh\" applies to only the regulative verses of the Islamic scriptures. In Tabarī's words:\n\nAccording to scholar Recep Dogan, the \"three types of evidence\" allowed for naskh are a) report from Muhammad or companions, b) \"\"ijma\" (consensus of the mujtahids upon naskh) and c) knowledge of the chronology of the Qur'anic revelation\".\n\nThe plausibility and validity of abrogation is determined through a chronological study of the primary sources, where early revelations are considered invalid and overruled by later revelations. This has historically been a difficult task because the verses in the Qur'an are not arranged by chronology but rather by size of chapters, and even within a chapter, the verses are non-chronologically arranged. The verses 2:190, 2:191 and 2:192, for example, were revealed to Muhammad six years after the verse 2:193. Thus, the context of each revelation is not ascertainable from verses near a verse, or the sequential verse number.\n\nAndrew Rippin complains that naskh texts in Islam do not demonstrate that verses rendered invalid by shariah law were revealed earlier, but simply assume they must be.\n\nA classic example of this is the early community's increasingly belligerent posture towards its pagan and Jewish neighbors:\n\nMuslim exegetes and jurists have disagreed and disputed the number of verses of the Quran and sunnah in the Hadiths recognized as abrogated.\n\n\nThis is explained by \nYasir Qadhi explains that one reason for the difference in number of abrogated verses comes from a confusion over \"naskh\" (abrogation) and \"takhsees\" (clarification). Qadhi cites the following as an example of \"takhsees\": verse 8:1 says the \"spoils are for Allah and His Messenger\", whereas 8:41 says \"one-fifth is for Allah and His Messenger\"; thus verse 8:41 explains 8:1, it doesn't cancel it. Yet many scholars, he says, include clarified verses with abrogated ones to produce a large total of abrogated verses.\n\nIbn Al-Qayyim and Abu Amina Elias argue that what early Muslims called abrogating was actually interpretation\nA number of reports of prominent early Muslims — such as Rashidun caliphs ‘Umar bin al-Khaṭṭāb and ‘Alī bin Abī Ṭālib — emphasize the importance of studying \"naskh\". In one report Ali told a judge who had no knowledge of nasikh that he was \"deluded and misleading others\", in another he evicted a preacher from a mosque for being ignorant of the science of abrogation. Umar is reported to have told Muslims that despite the fact that Ubay ibn Ka'b was \"the best Quranic expert among us\" \"we ignore some of what\" he says because he disregarded abrogation and told others he refused to \"abandon anything I heard from the Messenger of Allah\".\n\nIslamic scholars have offered a range of opinion as to the technical meaning and usage of \"Naskh\"'. These span between suspension with replacement of the old verse (\"ibdāl\") to the nullification of the old verse (\"ibtāl\"). To work around this problem exegetes such as Tabarī interpolated \"hukm\" (ruling) in place of the word \"āya\" (verse), arguing that the something being replaced is the ruling not the verse, so that if a ruling is replaced the preservation or not of its wording in the \"mushaf\" (written record of Quranic revelation) is immaterial. Alternate interpretations were also suggested for the subordinate clause's \"cause to be forgotten\" (\"aw nansahā\"), such as defer or leave. This was primarily motivated by flight from the theologically repugnant idea of prophetic forgetting, with Q.15:9 cited as evidence of its impossibility. Yet verses Q.17:86, Q.18:24, and Q.87:6–7 may seem to endorse its feasibility. Thus \"Qur'ān-forgetting is clearly adumbrated in the Qur'ān\". Many ahadith also attest to the phenomenon: entire suras which the Muslims had previously recited, claims one, would one morning be discovered to have been completely erased from memory (cf. Abū 'Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām).\n\nThree modes of \"naskh\" were proposed by the classical exegetes, which apply when one verse of the Quran is being compared to another conflicting ruling in a verse in the Quran, or when one ruling in the sunnah in a Hadith is being compared to another sunnah: (Naskh concerns itself with only revelations pertaining to positive laws — commandments (amr) or prohibitions (nahy).)\n\nAbrogation of the ruling but not the wording. A regulation-embodied within either a Qur'ānic verse or a hadith is replaced with a new ruling, but its wording is retained in the scripture, as text within the \"mushaf\". While retaining the text may cause confusion to those inadvertently following the repealed rule, according to Khan, tampering/doctoring with sacred texts has been rejected since medieval times.\nOf these three modes of \"naskh\", it was the first — \"naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa\" — which received widespread recognition.\n\nAbrogation of both ruling and wording. A ruling is voided and its text omitted from the \"mushaf\". Evidence that the verse ever existed is preserved only within tradition. An example is a report from Aisha stating that \"Among the things that were revealed of the Qur’an was that ten definite breastfeedings make a person a mahram [i.e. if a woman breastfeeds a child ten times, that child cannot grow up to marry any of the woman's natural children], then that was abrogated and replaced with five definite breastfeedings, and the Messenger of Allah ... passed away when this was among the things that were still recited of the Qur’an.\" Narrated by Muslim, 1452.\nLiaquat Ali Khan states that \"very few Muslim jurists concede that any portion of the Quran has been removed\" through this mode of abrogation. However, Wahhabi scholar Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid describing these three modes of 'Naskh\", and quote two other scholars (Muhammad ‘Abd al-‘Azeem az-Zarqaani and Ibn ‘Atiyyah) who do also. And John Burton writes that this second mode is generally acknowledged, in part due to the many alleged instances of revelatory erasure:\n\nAbrogation of the wording but not the ruling. In this mode of abrogation, the text is deleted from the \"mushaf\", but the rule is a still-functional. Proof of the verse's existence is preserved within tradition (i.e through a hadith report) as well as in the \"Fiqh\".\nThis mode raises the question of why a verse important enough to be the basis of immutable \"hukm\" (ruling) would disappear from the written Quran. It was accepted by only a minority of scholars. The most prominent alleged instance of this sort of abrogation is the \"naskh\" of the so-called \"āyat al-rajm\", or stoning verse. Adduced to exist from a tradition derived from the caliph 'Umar, the verse provided Qur'ānic sanction for the penalty for adultery found within the \"Fiqh\" (i.e. stoning) in contravention to the penalty prescribed by Q.24:2 – flogging.\n\nThe postulation of this mode stems (indirectly, however) from the Shāfi'ī's principle that the Qur'an may not abrogate ahadith or ahadith abrogate the Qur'an:\n\nThough Shāfi'ī thus never in fact postulated the existence of a \"stoning verse\", in one particular instance he did acknowledge the probability of \"abrogation of wording but not ruling\", as well as acknowledging Aisha's claim that there was a stoning verse in Quran, which had been lost.\n\nThe elimination of earlier verse from the mushaf that is part of the latter two modes of \"naskh\" creates a distinction between the Qur'ān as temporally contingent document-i.e. the \"mushaf\"- and the Qur'ān as the unity of all revelation ever sent down to Muhammed. According to some exegetes this latter conception is not a wholly abstract one, but is a historical reality.\n\n\nA fourth mode of \"naskh\", deemed \"external,\" is that between religions. In this mode, some Islamic scholars interpret Muhammad abrogated religious laws handed down by messengers before him from those of Jewish and Christian faiths, in order to, states John Burton, correct the major aberrations in Judaism and Christianity. According to Burton, \"that Muhammad accepted a doctrine of external \"naskh\" cannot be doubted\", since the abrogation verse 2:106 was revealed after a series of verses where Muhammad, among other things, abrogated many aspects of the Jewish Halakha, may intend this sort of \"naskh\". According to Muhammad Sameel ‘Abd al-Haqq there are \"many\" commentators and other scholars who believe that in ayah 2:106 (\"None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause it to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar ...\") \"Our revelations\" refers to the revelations \"before\" the Qur’an, \"something better or similar\" refers to the Quran itself.\n\nThe Arabic word in verses 2:106 and 16:101 that is translated as revelation is <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Ayah<nowiki>\"</nowiki>. This word in its literal meaning is \"sign\", \"miracle\" and \"evidence\" (see Āyah). However it is also used to refer to the verses inside the Quran and as a general expression for a revelation. An example in favor of the translation as \"miracle\" and \"revelation\" can be seen in Surah 3:49, in which Jesus is send to the sons of Israel: \"And [make him (Jesus)] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign (biāyatin) from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah. And I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allah. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign (laāyatan) for you, if you are believers\" (Sahih International). The first mentioned sign (biāyatin) indicates Jesus performing \"miracles\" in the literal context while the latter sign, Jesus coming to the sons of Israel with new laws, and describing this as \"And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses\" then coming to an end with \"Indeed in that is a sign (laāyatan)\", indicates a new revelation in form of the Gospel (see Gospel in Islam).\n\nFrequently cited examples of abrogation of older verses (\"mansūkh\") with newer verses (\"nasikh\") within Qur'ān are:\n\n\n\nExamples of inter-Qur'ānic abrogation, where one of the rulings comes from the Sunnah, are:\n\nThe principle of \"naskh\" is acknowledged by both Sunnis and Shī'a.\n\nSome Muslim scholars (Al-Sha`rani and Shah Wali Allah) were skeptical of the use of Naskh, considering it a sort of short cut to be avoided. According to contemporary scholar Jonathan A.C. Brown, \nAl-Sha`rani considered claims of abrogation [to be] \"the recourse of those mediocre and narrow-minded jurists whose hearts God had not illuminated with his Light. They could not perceive all the interpretive possibilities in the words of God and the Prophet … By taking the shortcut of stamping Quranic verses or Hadiths 'abrogated', such ulama had restricted the interpretive plurality that God had intended in the Shariah. For Sha’rani only when a Hadith included the Prophet’s own clear abrogation, like his report about visiting graves, could it be considered Naskh.\n\nShah Wali Allah was similarly skeptical of the ulama’s excessive indulgence in abrogation to explain the relationship between Quranic verses or hadiths. In all but five cases, he found explanations for how to understand the relationship between scriptural passages without recourse to abrogation.”\nAccording to David Powers, Islamic scholars have asked if inherent in abrogation is not the question of whether the Quran is really the word of an eternal, all-knowing, omniscient, omnipotent God, since such a God would have no need to change His mind (His eternal divine will), and would not reveal something wrong or imperfect in the first place. Why would the Quran — the creation of omniscient, omnipotent God — have contradictions within it, or verses in need of being replaced by another?\n\nThe \"God changing his mind\" problem has led a few Islamic scholars to deny the theory of \"Naskh\", declaring the Quran to be perfect and without any contradictions through rationalizing the contradictions and reinterpreting contradictory verses. The vast majority of scholars, however, accept that there are significant contradictions within the Quran, within the Hadiths, between the Quran and the Hadiths, and that the doctrine of abrogation as revealed by the Quran is necessary to establish Sharia.\n\nAmong the non-mainstream sects of Islam that rejected \"naskh\" were the Mu'tazili, Zaidiyah, and Quranists, on the rationalist grounds that the word of God could not contain contradictions. According to scholar Karel Steenbrink, most twentieth century modernist or reformist scholars, consider the theory \"an insult to the integrity and value of the uncreated revelation of God.\"\n\nMore recently the Ahmadiyya also reject the theory of \"naskh\" and argue that all Qur'ānic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the \"unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān\". The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī \"fiqh\", so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific situation for which it was revealed), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.\n\nPhilip Schaff argues that the concept of abrogation was developed to \"remove\" contradictions found in the Quran which (according to him) abound \"in repetitions and contradictions, which are not removed by the convenient theory of abrogation.\"\nAnother complaint is that naskh requires time-bound revelation, which is at odds with a revealer of truth who is an all-knowing, all-wise, eternal, self-existent creator and sustainer of the universe.\n\nAside from the argument that aspects of the Quran’s message and the Prophet’s teachings had to change as circumstances changed, some Islamic scholars defend naskh from the \"God-changed-his-mind problem\" maintaining that \"whoever rejects abrogation has rejected His sovereignty and might\" (‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di), and that \"abrogation as a mechanism that perfectly reflects God’s omnipotence. God can change any ruling with another at any point in time He sees fit\" (Louay Fatoohi). Cyril Glasse states that \"generally\" in \"naskh\", a universal meaning was \"modified\" by a \"more specific\" meaning, necessary since the 'style' of Divine revelation is \"direct and absolute\", without \"clauses, exceptions and qualification\".\n\nIn answer to complaints by Christians and Jews that the Quran abrogates (at least) much of the Torah and New Testament, Ghulam Ahmed Parwez states that this is simply God's doing, something that humans should not question,\n\n\"The Ahl-ul-Kitab (People of the Book) also question the need for a new revelation (Qur’an) when previous revelations from Allah exist. They further ask why the Qur’an contains injunctions contrary to the earlier Revelation (the Torah) if it is from Allah? (...) Say to them that no one can question why Allah has adopted such a system of revelation. Do they not know that Allah, Who is sovereign over the universe, alone knows which law is to be revealed and at what time? (Say to them that) if despite knowing this fact, they still refuse to obey this code of laws, they will find that no other code can resolve the problems of life. In this context, O Jamat-ul-Momineen (the convinced Muslims)!\n\nThe emergence of \"naskh\" (initially as practice and then as fully elaborated theory) dates back to the first centuries of Islamic civilization. Almost all classical \"naskh\" works, for instance, begin by recounting the incident of the Kufan preacher banned from expounding the Quran by an early \"'ilmic\" authority figure (usually 'Alī but sometimes also Ibn 'Abbās) on account of his ignorance of the principles of \"naskh\".\nWhatever the historicity of such traditions:\n\nMore precisely:\n\nLike other technical terms within Islamic exegesis (e.g. \"asbāb al-nuzūl\"), \"naskh\" attained its formal meaning through a process of theoretical refinement in which early applications of the concept were abandoned upon further logical or religious consideration. Tabarī's ambivalent use of the term for the eradication of Satanic material has already been noted. Among \"naskh\" 's other, ultimately discarded, uses in early works of \"tafsīr\" are: the abrogation of a ruling from pre-Islamic (i.e. \"jāhilī\") Arabia, and the juridical deflation of a broadly applicable ruling by a succeeding one which narrows its scope (\"nasakha min [al-āya]\"- \"an exception is provided to [the verse]\"). The latter usage was reformulated by Shāfi'ī as \"takhsīs (specification/exception)\", resulting in a marked decrease in the amount of material considered \"mansūkh\".\n\nPutting aside dubiously attributed works, such as the \"Naskh al-Qur-ān\" of \"al-Zuhrī\", the principle of abrogation (without its \"naskh\" terminology) makes one of its earliest documented appearance in the \"Muwatta'\" of Mālik:\n\nThe impetus for this principle, seen already in Mālik's day, was the need to harmonize the regional variants of Islamic law both with one another as well as the putative sources of Islamic law. That the starting point for these local \"fiqhs\" was in fact neither the Qur'ān nor the Sunnah (in its later sense of the Sunnah of Muhammad) has been shown by Schacht. As authority for local views began to be attributed back in time to the Companions and eventually Muhammad himself (documented by what Schacht terms the \"backward growth\" of \"isnāds\") the contradictions in regional \"fiqh\" became irreconcilable. \"Naskh\" allowed for the alleviation of these tensions by the claim that, in the case of two \"soundly\" documented traditions contradicting one another, one had come later and abrogated the other.\n\nYet even after the need to ground their legal theories in either Sunnah or Qur'ān became apparent to the jurists, the regional \"fiqhs\" were not discarded, but became the third source in reformualting Islamic law, on par with and of even greater importance than Sunnah or Qur'ān! This can be seen in the postulation of \"lost\" verses whose rulings were still operative and conventiently corroborative of the jurist's own school of \"fiqh\" (e.g. the \"stoning\" and \"suckling\" verses). It is also evinced in Shāfi'ī's remarkable admission that but for the guidance of the Sunnah the Muslims would have had no choice but to carry out the rulings of the Qur'ān!\n\n\"Naskh\" stimulated several lines of theologizing to reconcile this \"reality of the \"Fiqh\"\" with Islam's core religious doctrines.\n\nProbably the most immediate concern was explaining the very existence of progressive revelation. What could account for God's turn to this expedient outside of limits to His omniscience (subsequent rulings are \"better\" because they are informed by superior knowledge) or inconstancy in the divine will? Both prospects were repugnant to orthodox theologians (at least of the Sunni variety; compare this to the Shi'ite doctrine of \"bada'\", however) and so other rationales were put forth. One of these relied upon the tried apologetic technique of reconstruing apparent limitations in the Creator as expressions of solicitude towards His creatures, introducing less onerous requirements:\n\nYet \"tahkfīf\" is equally applicable where the \"nāsikh\" introduces a more onerous requirement- for example, the extension of the ritual fast from a few days (Q.2:184) to the entire month of Ramadan (Q.2:185)- as its performance is \"better\" for men on account of it helping them attain greater reward in the Hereafter, or even when the change is indifferent, such as the switching of the \"qibla\", as the reward will not change. Clearly, then, the criteria of \"tahkfīf\" is unfalsifiable, completely useless for distinguishing \"nāsikh\" from \"mansūkh\", and therefore entirely dogmatic in character.\n\nAnother, much more specifically Islamic, problem was raised by the doctrine by \"mu'jaz\"- or the literary perfection and inimitability of the Qur'ān. How could one āya be replaced by one which is better than it, as Q.2:106 explicitly promises, if all \"āyat\" or inimitable and therefore incommensurable? This issue was sidestepped by interpolation; the superior replacement is the verse's ruling, not the verse's wording, and so no violation of the doctrine of \"mu'jaz\" is entailed.\n\nLastly, there is the issue of abrogated material whose wording is preserved in the \"mushaf\" (\"naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa\"). Since the verse's ruling is inoperative, what purpose is served by retaining its wording? One common rationale, expressed here by Suyūti (\"Itqān\") and mirroring the \"tahkfīf\" argument was:\n\nOverall, though, the Muslim commentators demonstrate a remarkable degree of complacency in the face of \"naskh\" 's more theologically disturbing implications, supremely confident (as expressed in the following gloss on a famous Ā'isha hadith) that whatever the mechanisms used to expurgate or cancel the Divine revelation, what has ultimately come down to us is exactly what Allah intended mankind to have:\n\nSuch complacency reflects the important constitutive effects of \"naskh\"'s eventual theological sanitization. Once the genuineness of God's abrogation of His own commandments was accepted, the fact that no intelligible pattern underlay His sequence of actions was taken as indicative of important facts about the nature of the Creator, as well as the proper duties of His creatures. In particular this reinforced the extreme deontological currents within Islamic philosophy and ethics:\n\nThe Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam have maintained that only Quranic verses revealed later can abrogate an earlier Quranic verse, but a Sunnah from a Hadith can never abrogate a Quranic verse. In contrast, the Hanafi fiqh of Sunni Islam, from the days of Abu Hanifa, along with his disciples such as Abu Yusuf, maintained that Sunnah can abrogate a Quranic verse. The Hanafi jurists used Quranic verse 10:15 to justify their opinion, stating that abrogation of the Qur’an by the life actions of Muhammad (Sunnah) was based solely on his Divine inspiration, that when he acted or said anything, any abrogation implicit through his action, of the earlier Qur’anic ruling was from Allah alone, according to Yusuf Suicmez. Hanafi school stated, adds Suicmez, that to accept that \"a Sunnah can abrogate the Qur’an entails honoring of Muhammad\".\n\nWhile traditional doctrine of naskh has been used to abrogate earlier ayat in favor of later ones, which form the basis of Islamic law, this was reversed by Sudanese scholar Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, who advanced the idea that the Meccan surah, while revealed earlier (and which give more prominence to the position of women and also praise other prophets and their communities—i.e. Jews and Christians), contain \"the basic and pure doctrine of Islam\", and should form the \"basis of the legislation\" for modern society. These ayat abrogate some of the later (and less tolerant) but specialized Medinan surah which were revealed while Muhammad was governing that city and contain \"compromises\" for its political climate. While the Medinan surah were appropriate for their time, their doctrine is not eternal and not necessarily appropriate for the 20th or 21st century.\n\nAbrogation is applicable to both sources of Sharia: the Quran and the Hadiths. A Qur'ānic verse may abrogate another Qur'ānic verse, and a Sunnah in Hadiths may likewise abrogate another Sunnah. The possibility of abrogation between these two sources, though, was a more contentious issue precipitated by the absence within a source of the appropriate abrogating (\"nāsikh\") or abrogated (\"mansūkh\") material necessary to bring concordance between it and the \"Fiqh\". The scope of Naskh doctrine between sources has been one of the major differences between the Shafi'i and Hanafi fiqhs, with Shafi'i sect of jurisprudence forbidding abrogation by the Sunnah of the Qur'ān, while Hanafi sect allowing abrogation by the Sunnah of the Qur'ān.\n\nIn Shāfi'ī's source theory the possibility of abrogation between the Sunnah and the Qur'ān was vehemently denied:\n\nThis stance was a reaction to larger developments within Islamic jurisprudence, particularly the reformulation of the \"Fiqh\" away from early foreign or regional influences and toward more eminently Islamic bases such as the Qur'ān. This assertion of Qur'ānic primacy was accompanied by calls for an abandonment of the Sunnah. Shāfi'ī's insistence upon the impossibility of contradiction between Sunnah and Qur'ān can thus be seen as one component in this larger effort of rescuing the Sunnah:\n\nLater scholars, writing when the juridical legitimacy of the Sunnah could be taken for granted (thanks largely to Shāfi'ī's efforts!), were less inclined to adopt his inflexible stance. To their minds the reality of this sort of inter-source abrogation was proven by several \"indisputable\" instances: the changing of the \"qibla\" towards Mecca and away from Jerusalem, and the introduction of the penalty of stoning for adultery. The following passage from Qurtubī (\"al-Jāmi' li ahkām al-Qur'ān\") is representative in this regard:\n\nAl-Ghazālī employs the same examples in his \"Mustasfā\".\n\nIn addition to being discussed within general works of jurisprudence, \"naskh\" generated its own corpus of specialized legal manuals. These treatises invariably begin with an introduction designed to impress the importance and high Islamic credibility of the science, often by an appeal to \"'ilmic\" authority figures of the past (as in the story of 'Alī and the Kufan preacher). As is made clear in these stories, \"none may occupy judicial or religious office in the community who is not equipped with this indispensable knowledge and who is incapable of distinguishing nāsikh [abrogator] from mansūkh [abrogatee].\n\nThe remainder of the introduction then typically treats the various modes of \"naskh\", \"naskh\" 's applicability between Sunnah and Qur'ān, and- in appeasement of theological scruples- why \"naskh\" is not the same as badā', or inconstancy of the Divine Will. Following this comes the core of the treatise, an enumeration of abrogated verses in \"sūra\" order of the Qur'ān. In their consideration of \"nāsikh wal-mansūkh\" the taxonomic predilections of these authors comes out, evinced in their discussions of special verses considered \"marvels\" (\"'ajā'ib\") of the Qur'ān, such as the verse which abrogates the greatest number of other verses (Q.9:5), the verse which was in effect longest until it was abrogated (Q.46:9), and the verse which contains both an abrogatee and its abrogator (Q.5:105).\n\nThe following is a list of classical examples of the genre:\n\nModern examples include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1232997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1232997", "title": "Oikonomos", "text": "Oikonomos\n\nOikonomos (Greek: οἰκονόμος, from \"oiko-\" 'house' and \"-nomos\" 'rule, law'), latinized oeconomus or œconomus, was an Ancient Greek word meaning 'household manager'. In Byzantine times the term was used as a title of a manager or treasurer of an organisation.\n\nIt is a title in the Roman Catholic Church. In the 1983 Code of Canon Law, an oeconomus is the diocesan finance officer (c. 494).\n\nThe \"Oikos\" (household) was the base unit for the organization of social, political, and economic life in the Ancient Greek world. The person in charge of all its affairs was the \"oikonomos\". The \"oikos\" was composed of a nuclear family as well as extended family members such as grandparents or unmarried female relatives. The husband of the core nuclear family was generally the \"oikonomos\". The ancient Greek world was a patrilocal society. A married woman would join her husbands \"oikos\". However, the woman would still remain a member of the \"oikos\" she grew up in and would return to her original \"oikos\" upon the end of a marriage. The \"oikonomos\" of a household, in addition to making economic decisions for the \"oikos\", acted as legal guardian, or \"kyrios\" (a word meaning 'lord' or 'controller'), for other members of the household. In this capacity, they were generally responsible for male members of the household under the age of 18, unmarried women, as well as their wife. Marriage in the Greek world was seen as the transfer of responsibility over a woman from one \"kyrios\" to another. In most cases from her father to her husband. The \"kyrios\" was understood to make decisions in the best interest of his wards about education, finances, and marriage. Although it differed between different Greek cities, an \"oikonomos\" in Athens would have the authority to dispose of his wife's property owing to his role as her \"kyrios\". In other cities, such as Gortyn and Sparta it appears that married women had the right to use their property as they wished. The power of the \"oikonomos\" to act as \"kyrios\" was not unlimited. In Athens, an individual who had been under the care of a \"kyrios\" would be able to seek legal recourse for damages caused by their former \"kyrios\". The \"oikonomos\" in his role as \"kyrios\" also had many responsibilities. He was expected to provide education for boys under his care, represent his wards in legal proceedings, provide for their everyday needs as well as arrange marriages of women in his care.\n\nIn addition to family members by kinship or marriage, slaves or metics might have lived and worked within the household. Wealthy households would have had many slaves and metics working for them. The \"oikonomos\" of the household would have played a role in directing the labor of the slaves and metics. While the \"oikonomos\" did not have absolute power over members of his \"oikos\" owing to his role as \"kyrios\", this was not the case for slaves.The Greeks did not consider him to be a \"kyrios\" to the slaves, he was instead their \"despotes\", a word meaning master. In some extreme cases, slave were seen as factors of production without any agency rather than autonomous human beings. A small \"oikos\" would have had only a few household slaves known as \"oiketai.\" Of the \"oiketai,\" the men might have had the responsibility to work in the field. In a larger \"oikos\", many slaves would be entirely dedicated to agricultural work. This is generally considered to be less favorable than work in the house itself.\n\nThe \"oikos\" was the primary unit of economic organization within the ancient Greek world. Genuine urban commercial centers were relatively uncommon and sparse. Additionally, lack of trust between members of an \"oikos\" and nonmembers usually prevented larger businesses not associated with an \"oikos\" from forming. For these reasons, the \"oikos\" remained the pillar of ancient Greek economy. An \"oikos\" was expected to be self sufficient in what it produced for itself. Thinkers such as Aristotle considered the self-sufficient \"oikos\" to be the fundamental, indivisible constituent of the \"polis\". In order to be a true \"oikos,\" it had to be entirely self-sustaining it what it produced and consumed, as well as maintain its population over time. Most of the processing and storage facilities needed to run a farm, such as grain stores and oil presses, were found on the land owned by the \"oikos\". The continued existence of the \"oikos\" was dependent on its ability to store goods for the future and the prudence of the \"oikonomos\" in anticipating future needs. Chance weather events, warfare, sick animals, pests, and even aging members of the \"oikos\" could seriously threaten its existence. Households which practiced a trade in addition to or instead of farming, often had their workshops located within the house in a room facing the street.\n\nIn addition to his plethora of economic and social responsibilities, the \"oikonomos\" would also be the representative of his \"oikos\" to the outside world. He would be expected to provide funds for religious festivals, attend important events such as births and marriages, as well as fulfill his civic duties as a member of the \"polis\". Depending on the city, this might have included military service. The \"oikonomos\" was also expected to maintain relationships with other households in the \"polis\". In the event of an emergency an \"oikonomos\" might be able to seek help from a neighboring \"oikos\". In return the \"oikonomos\" would be expected to provide material aid to these same neighbors in their own time of need. This effectively established a credit system for a pre-bank economy.\n\nXenophon's Oeconomicus is one of the earliest sources to extensively discuss the management of a wealthy agrarian estate. Here, the role of the \"oikonomos\" largely concerned management of his household with the aim of accumulating and preserving wealth, rather than a relation to any modern sense of \"economics\". Socrates and Critobulus consider household management to be an art or science, and the former argues that the best \"oikonomos\" is the one who makes the best use of resources; one with an abundance of material wealth which is insufficient to satisfy his needs is functionally poorer than one with little wealth which satisfies him. In this portrayal, though Socrates figures his own property to be worth a hundredfold less than Critobulus', he has enough to satisfy himself and friends who would help him if he did not; the latter has social obligations of sacrifice, patronage, entertaining guests, and financing potential wars. This leads Socrates to consider himself far wealthier than Critobulus. Meanwhile, Ischomachus, a \"fair and good\" upper-class farmer, focuses his instructions on household managing on the importance of ensuring his wife's submissiveness and of close supervision of the house, as well as on a thorough understanding of agricultural techniques. In short, Xenophon characterizes the \"oikonomos\" as holding power over children, slaves, wife, and property, along with the power to delegate authority to overseers; however, this account specifically concerns wealthy estates.\n\nAristotle, however, argued that the role of \"master of the house\" is a position of nature rather than of particular skill in household management. He disagrees with the notion that household management is synonymous with wealth acquisition, instead proposing that it is \"the art which uses household stores\". To the extent that there is a natural part of household management which concerns acquisition, it is limited to the provision of basic necessities. The obligation of Aristotle's \"oikonomos\" is to use and order wealth (the most essential of which are the necessities for survival which nature provides, which are presupposed) rather than to acquire it.\n\nNor does Aristotle believe that wealth acquisition is furthered solely by good home management, as he argues in Rhetoric that to pontificate on growing the wealth of a country, a political speaker must understand foreign and domestic affairs. Aristotle specifically objects to the sophist Alcidamas's use of \"oikonomos\" in the context of a rhetorician as \"dispenser of pleasure to his audience\". This was part of a repudiation of Alcidamas' tendency to use excessive metaphors and \"long, unseasonable, or frequent epithets\".\n\nAristotle also emphasizes the importance of the household in tragedies and comedies. In Poetics, he writes that the tragedian Euripides is faulty in his \"\"oikonomia\"\", translated as \"management\" as well as (more directly) \"economy\", of the subject of tragedy. This is in part because the households he portrays are poorly suited to tragic plays. Meanwhile, a proper tragedy, such as those pertaining to the House of Atreus or Oedipus, must involve a family or household (oikos) which elicits pity from the audience; to this end, it must be familiar to the audience but not intimately so. The poet here is an \"oikonomos,\" responsible for the management and deliverance of his play, in addition to the presentation of the \"oikos\" which is the subject.\n\nHesiod presents in \"Works and Days\" instructions on household management, emphasizing the link between one's wealth-getting and his work ethic with respect to farming and keeping his house in order. Here he appears to consider a \"house\" to represent the sum total of all that the \"oikonomos\" owns.\n\nThe Seleucid Empire was divided into administrative regions known as satrapies. Hypotheses differ as to the role of the \"oikonomos\". Some theorize that they were managers of the royal treasuries or even royal estates, which would have made them completely separate from any actual administrative role. An \"oikonomos\" may also have been a satrapy's financial director, or perhaps an accountant for tax receipts and administrative expenses. The \"oikonomos\" was probably a low-ranking figure, as accounts place them in charge of trivial local decisions and subordinate to the \"strategos\", who functioned as governor of the satrapy. An inscription of a correspondence between two priests uncovered north of Sardis references an \"oikonomos\" named Asklepiades, and suggests that it was his duty to find and set up a location for a stele to be inscribed with the names of the priests and their initiates. Another inscription implies that \"oikonomoi\" were responsible for purchasing bulls for sacrifice at the \"Panegyreis\".\n"}

{"id": "1234517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1234517", "title": "Nanoparticle", "text": "Nanoparticle\n\nNanoparticles are particles between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in size with a surrounding interfacial layer. The interfacial layer is an integral part of nanoscale matter, fundamentally affecting all of its properties. The interfacial layer typically consists of ions, inorganic and organic molecules. Organic molecules coating inorganic nanoparticles are known as stabilizers, capping and surface ligands, or passivating agents. In nanotechnology, a particle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit with respect to its transport and properties. Particles are further classified according to diameter.\n\nThe term \"nanoparticle\" is not usually applied to individual molecules; it usually refers to inorganic materials.\n\nUltrafine particles are the same as nanoparticles and between 1 and 100 nm in size, as opposed to fine particles are sized between 100 and 2,500 nm, and coarse particles cover a range between 2,500 and 10,000 nm. The reason for the synonymous definition of nanoparticles and ultrafine particles is that, during the 1970s and 80s, when the first thorough fundamental studies with \"nanoparticles\" were underway in the USA (by Granqvist and Buhrman) and Japan, (within an ERATO Project) they were called \"ultrafine particles\" (UFP). However, during the 1990s before the National Nanotechnology Initiative was launched in the USA, the new name, \"nanoparticle,\" had become more common (for example, see the same senior author's paper 20 years later addressing the same issue, lognormal distribution of sizes). Nanoparticles can exhibit size-related properties significantly different from those of either fine particles or bulk materials.\n\nNanoclusters have at least one dimension between 1 and 10 nanometers and a narrow size distribution. Nanopowders are agglomerates of ultrafine particles, nanoparticles, or nanoclusters. Nanometer-sized single crystals, or single-domain ultrafine particles, are often referred to as nanocrystals.\n\nAccording to ISO Technical Specification 80004, a nanoparticle is defined as a nano-object with all three external dimensions in the nanoscale, whose longest and shortest axes do not differ significantly, with a significant difference typically being a factor of at least 3.\n\nThe terms colloid and nanoparticle are not interchangeable. A colloid is a mixture which has solid particles dispersed in a liquid medium. The term applies only if the particles are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit Brownian motion, with the critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranging from nanometers (10 m) to micrometers (10 m). Colloids can contain particles too large to be nanoparticles, and nanoparticles can exist in non-colloidal form, for examples as a powder or in a solid matrix.\n\nAlthough nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they have a long history. Nanoparticles were used by artisans as far back as Rome in the fourth century in the famous Lycurgus cup made of dichroic glass as well as the ninth century in Mesopotamia for creating a glittering effect on the surface of pots. In modern times, pottery from the Middle Ages and Renaissance often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter. This luster is caused by a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a glazing. The luster can still be visible if the film has resisted atmospheric oxidation and other weathering.\n\nThe luster originates within the film itself, which contains silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed homogeneously in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding copper and silver salts and oxides together with vinegar, ochre, and clay on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The object is then placed into a kiln and heated to about 600 °C in a reducing atmosphere. In heat the glaze softens, causing the copper and silver ions to migrate into the outer layers of the glaze. There the reducing atmosphere reduced the ions back to metals, which then came together forming the nanoparticles that give the color and optical effects. Luster technique showed that ancient craftsmen had a sophisticated empirical knowledge of materials. The technique originated in the Muslim world. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.\n\nMichael Faraday provided the first description, in scientific terms, of the optical properties of nanometer-scale metals in his classic 1857 paper. In a subsequent paper, the author (Turner) points out that: \"It is well known that when thin leaves of gold or silver are mounted upon glass and heated to a temperature that is well below a red heat (~500 °C), a remarkable change of properties takes place, whereby the continuity of the metallic film is destroyed. The result is that white light is now freely transmitted, reflection is correspondingly diminished, while the electrical resistivity is enormously increased.\"\n\nNanoparticles are of great scientific interest as they are, in effect, a bridge between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures. A bulk material should have constant physical properties regardless of its size, but at the nano-scale size-dependent properties are often observed. Thus, the properties of materials change as their size approaches the nanoscale and as the percentage of the surface in relation to the percentage of the volume of a material becomes significant. For bulk materials larger than one micrometer (or micron), the percentage of the surface is insignificant in relation to the volume in the bulk of the material. \"The interesting and sometimes unexpected properties of nanoparticles are therefore largely due to the large surface area of the material, which dominates the contributions made by the small bulk of the material\".\n\nNanoparticles often possess unexpected optical properties as they are small enough to confine their electrons and produce quantum effects. For example, gold nanoparticles appear deep-red to black in solution. Nanoparticles of yellow gold and grey silicon are red in color. Gold nanoparticles melt at much lower temperatures (~300 °C for 2.5 nm size) than the gold slabs (1064 °C);.\nAbsorption of solar radiation is much higher in materials composed of nanoparticles than it is in thin films of continuous sheets of material. In both solar PV and solar thermal applications, controlling the size, shape, and material of the particles, it is possible to control solar absorption. Recently, the core (metal)-shell (dielectric) nanoparticle has demonstrated a zero backward scattering with enhanced forward scattering on Si substrate when surface plasmon is located in front of a solar cell. The core-shell nanoparticles can support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, demonstrating entirely new properties when compared with bare metallic nanoparticles if the resonances are properly engineered.\n\nOther size-dependent property changes include quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and superparamagnetism in magnetic materials. What would appear ironic is that the changes in physical properties are not always desirable. Ferromagnetic materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetisation direction using room temperature thermal energy, thus making them unsuitable for memory storage.\n\nSuspensions of nanoparticles are possible since the interaction of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome density differences, which otherwise usually result in a material either sinking or floating in a liquid.\n\nThe high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. Sintering can take place at lower temperatures, over shorter time scales than for larger particles. In theory, this does not affect the density of the final product, though flow difficulties and the tendency of nanoparticles to agglomerate complicates matters. Moreover, nanoparticles have been found to impart some extra properties to various day to day products. For example, the presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles imparts what we call the self-cleaning effect, and, the size being nano-range, the particles cannot be observed. Zinc oxide particles have been found to have superior UV blocking properties compared to its bulk substitute. This is one of the reasons why it is often used in the preparation of sunscreen lotions, is completely photostable and toxic.\nClay nanoparticles when incorporated into polymer matrices increase reinforcement, leading to stronger plastics, verifiable by a higher glass transition temperature and other mechanical property tests. These nanoparticles are hard, and impart their properties to the polymer (plastic). Nanoparticles have also been attached to textile fibers in order to create smart and functional clothing.\n\nMetal, dielectric, and semiconductor nanoparticles have been formed, as well as hybrid structures (e.g., core–shell nanoparticles). Nanoparticles made of semiconducting material may also be labeled quantum dots if they are small enough (typically sub 10 nm) that quantization of electronic energy levels occurs. Such nanoscale particles are used in biomedical applications as drug carriers or imaging agents with work being done to try to understand the fluid dynamic properties (e.g. drag forces) in nanoscale applications. This has shown the relationship between the fluid forces on nanoparticles and the fluid Reynolds and Knudsen numbers.\nSemi-solid and soft nanoparticles have been manufactured. A prototype nanoparticle of semi-solid nature is the liposome. Various types of liposome nanoparticles are currently used clinically as delivery systems for anticancer drugs and vaccines.\n\nNanoparticles with one half hydrophilic and the other half hydrophobic are termed Janus particles and are particularly effective for stabilizing emulsions. They can self-assemble at water/oil interfaces and act as solid surfactants.\n\nHydrogel nanoparticles made of N-isopropylacrylamide hydrogel core shell can be dyed with affinity baits, internally. These affinity baits allow the nanoparticles to isolate and remove undesirable proteins while enhancing the target analytes.\n\nThe chemical processing and synthesis of high-performance technological components for the private, industrial, and military sectors requires the use of high-purity ceramics (oxide ceramics, such as aluminium oxide or copper(II) oxide), polymers, glass-ceramics, and composite materials, as metal carbides (SiC), nitrides (Aluminum nitrides, Silicon nitride), metals (Al, Cu), non-metals (graphite, carbon nanotubes) and layered (Al + Aluminium carbonate, Cu + C). In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact.\n\nUncontrolled agglomeration of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneity. Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved.\n\nIn addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification. Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.\n\nInert gas evaporation and inert gas deposition are free many of these defects due to the distillation (cf. purification) nature of the process and having enough time to form single crystal particles, however even their non-aggreated deposits have lognormal size distribution, which is typical with nanoparticles. The reason why modern gas evaporation techniques can produce a relatively narrow size distribution is that aggregation can be avoided. However, even in this case, random residence times in the growth zone, due to the combination of drift and diffusion, result in a size distribution appearing lognormal.\n\nIt would, therefore, appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions that will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over interparticle forces. Monodisperse nanoparticles and colloids provide this potential.\nMonodisperse powders of colloidal silica, for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid that results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the basic elements of submicrometer colloidal materials science and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in high performance materials and components.\nThere are several methods for creating nanoparticles, including gas condensation, attrition, chemical precipitation, ion implantation, pyrolysis and hydrothermal synthesis. In attrition, macro- or micro-scale particles are ground in a ball mill, a planetary ball mill, or other size-reducing mechanism. The resulting particles are air classified to recover nanoparticles. In pyrolysis, a vaporous precursor (liquid or gas) is forced through an orifice at high pressure and burned. The resulting solid (a version of soot) is air classified to recover oxide particles from by-product gases. Traditional pyrolysis often results in aggregates and agglomerates rather than single primary particles. Ultrasonic nozzle spray pyrolysis (USP) on the other hand aids in preventing agglomerates from forming.\n\nA thermal plasma can deliver the energy to vaporize small micrometer-size particles. The thermal plasma temperatures are in the order of 10,000 K, so that solid powder easily evaporates. Nanoparticles are formed upon cooling while exiting the plasma region. The main types of the thermal plasma torches used to produce nanoparticles are dc plasma jet, dc arc plasma, and radio frequency (RF) induction plasmas. In the arc plasma reactors, the energy necessary for evaporation and reaction is provided by an electric arc formed between the anode and the cathode. For example, silica sand can be vaporized with an arc plasma at atmospheric pressure, or thin aluminum wires can be vaporized by exploding wire method. The resulting mixture of plasma gas and silica vapour can be rapidly cooled by quenching with oxygen, thus ensuring the quality of the fumed silica produced.\n\nIn RF induction plasma torches, energy coupling to the plasma is accomplished through the electromagnetic field generated by the induction coil. The plasma gas does not come in contact with electrodes, thus eliminating possible sources of contamination and allowing the operation of such plasma torches with a wide range of gases including inert, reducing, oxidizing, and other corrosive atmospheres. The working frequency is typically between 200 kHz and 40 MHz. Laboratory units run at power levels in the order of 30–50 kW, whereas the large-scale industrial units have been tested at power levels up to 1 MW. As the residence time of the injected feed droplets in the plasma is very short, it is important that the droplet sizes are small enough in order to obtain complete evaporation. The RF plasma method has been used to synthesize different nanoparticle materials, for example synthesis of various ceramic nanoparticles such as oxides, carbours/carbides, and nitrides of Ti and Si (see Induction plasma technology).\n\nInert-gas condensation is frequently used to produce metallic nanoparticles. The metal is evaporated in a vacuum chamber containing a reduced atmosphere of an inert gas. Condensation of the supersaturated metal vapor results in creation of nanometer-size particles, which can be entrained in the inert gas stream and deposited on a substrate or studied in situ. Early studies were based on thermal evaporation. Using magnetron sputtering to create the metal vapor allows to achieve higher yields. The method can easily be generalized to alloy nanoparticles by choosing appropriate metallic targets. The use of sequential growth schemes, where the particles travel through a second metallic vapor, results in growth of core-shell (CS) structures.\n\nNanoparticles can also be formed using radiation chemistry. Radiolysis from gamma rays can create strongly active free radicals in solution. This relatively simple technique uses a minimum number of chemicals. These including water, a soluble metallic salt, a radical scavenger (often a secondary alcohol), and a surfactant (organic capping agent). High gamma doses on the order of 10 Gray are required. In this process, reducing radicals will drop metallic ions down to the zero-valence state. A scavenger chemical will preferentially interact with oxidizing radicals to prevent the re-oxidation of the metal. Once in the zero-valence state, metal atoms begin to coalesce into particles. A chemical surfactant surrounds the particle during formation and regulates its growth. In sufficient concentrations, the surfactant molecules stay attached to the particle. This prevents it from dissociating or forming clusters with other particles. Formation of nanoparticles using the radiolysis method allows for tailoring of particle size and shape by adjusting precursor concentrations and gamma dose. \n\nThe sol–gel process is a wet-chemical technique (also known as chemical solution deposition) widely used recently in the fields of materials science and ceramic engineering. Such methods are used primarily for the fabrication of materials (typically a metal oxide) starting from a chemical solution (\"sol\", short for solution), which acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or \"gel\") of either discrete particles or network polymers.\nTypical precursors are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides, which undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions to form either a network \"elastic solid\" or a colloidal suspension (or dispersion) – a system composed of discrete (often amorphous) submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid. Formation of a metal oxide involves connecting the metal centers with oxo (M-O-M) or hydroxo (M-OH-M) bridges, therefore generating metal-oxo or metal-hydroxo polymers in solution. Thus, the sol evolves toward the formation of a gel-like diphasic system containing both a liquid phase and solid phase whose morphologies range from discrete particles to continuous polymer networks.\n\nIn the case of the colloid, the volume fraction of particles (or particle density) may be so low that a significant amount of fluid may need to be removed initially for the gel-like properties to be recognized. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. The most simple method is to allow time for sedimentation to occur, and then pour off the remaining liquid. Centrifugation can also be used to accelerate the process of phase separation.\n\nRemoval of the remaining liquid (solvent) phase requires a drying process, which typically causes shrinkage and densification. The rate at which the solvent can be removed is ultimately determined by the distribution of porosity in the gel. The ultimate microstructure of the final component will clearly be strongly influenced by changes implemented during this phase of processing. Afterward, a thermal treatment, or firing process, is often necessary in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties and structural stability via final sintering, densification, and grain growth. One of the distinct advantages of using this methodology as opposed to the more traditional processing techniques is that densification is often achieved at a much lower temperature.\n\nThe precursor sol can be either deposited on a substrate to form a film (e.g., by dip-coating or spin-coating), cast into a suitable container with the desired shape (e.g., to obtain a monolithic ceramics, glasses, fibers, membranes, aerogels), or used to synthesize powders (e.g., microspheres, nanospheres). The sol–gel approach is a cheap and low-temperature technique that allows for the fine control of the product’s chemical composition. Even small quantities of dopants, such as organic dyes and rare earth metals, can be introduced in the sol and end up uniformly dispersed in the final product. It can be used in ceramics processing and manufacturing as an investment casting material, or as a means of producing very thin films of metal oxides for various purposes. Sol–gel derived materials have diverse applications in optics, electronics, energy, space, (bio)sensors, medicine (e.g., controlled drug release) and separation (e.g., chromatography) technology.\n\nIon implantation may be used to treat the surfaces of dielectric materials such as sapphire and silica to make composites with near-surface dispersions of metal or oxide nanoparticles. See ion implantation#Ion implantation-induced nanoparticle formation\n\nScientists have taken to naming their particles after the real-world shapes that they might represent. Nanospheres, nanochains, nanoreefs, nanoboxes and more have appeared in the literature. These morphologies sometimes arise spontaneously as an effect of a templating or directing agent present in the synthesis such as miscellar emulsions or anodized alumina pores, or from the innate crystallographic growth patterns of the materials themselves. Some of these morphologies may serve a purpose, such as long carbon nanotubes used to bridge an electrical junction, or just a scientific curiosity like the stars shown at right.\n\nAmorphous particles usually adopt a spherical shape (due to their microstructural isotropy), whereas the shape of anisotropic microcrystalline whiskers corresponds to their particular crystal habit. At the small end of the size range, nanoparticles are often referred to as clusters. Spheres, rods, fibers, and cups are just a few of the shapes that have been grown. The study of fine particles is called micromeritics.\n\nNanoparticles have different analytical requirements than conventional chemicals, for which chemical composition and concentration are sufficient metrics. Nanoparticles have other physical properties that must be measured for a complete description, such as size, shape, surface properties, crystallinity, and dispersion state. Additionally, sampling and laboratory procedures can perturb their dispersion state or bias the distribution of other properties. In environmental contexts, an additional challenge is that many methods cannot detect low concentrations of nanoparticles that may still have an adverse effect. For some applications, nanoparticles may be characterized in complex matrices such as water, soil, food, polymers, inks, complex mixtures of organic liquids such as in cosmetics, or blood.\n\nThere are several overall categories of methods used to characterize nanoparticles. Microscopy methods generate images of individual nanoparticles to characterize their shape, size, and location. Electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy are the dominant methods. Because nanoparticles have a size below the diffraction limit of visible light, conventional optical microscopy is not useful. Electron microscopes can be coupled to spectroscopic methods that can perform elemental analysis. Microscopy methods are destructive, and can be prone to undesirable artifacts from sample preparation, or from probe tip geometry in the case of scanning probe microscopy. Additionally, microscopy is based on single-particle measurements, meaning that large numbers of individual particles must be characterized to estimate their bulk properties.\n\nSpectroscopy, which measures the particles' interaction with electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength, is useful for some classes of nanoparticles to characterize concentration, size, and shape. X-ray, ultraviolet–visible, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used with nanoparticles. Light scattering methods using laser light, X-rays, or neutron scattering are used to determine particle size, with each method suitable for different size ranges and particle compositions. Some miscellaneous methods are electrophoresis for surface charge, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method for surface area, and X-ray diffraction for crystal structure, as well as mass spectrometry for particle mass, and particle counters for particle number. Chromatography, centrifugation, and filtration techniques can be used to separate nanoparticles by size or other physical properties before or during characterization.\n\nFunctionalization is the introduction of organic molecules or polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle. The surface coating of nanoparticles determines many of their physical and chemical properties, notably stability, solubility, and targeting. A coating that is multivalent or polymeric confers high stability. Functionalized nanomaterial-based catalysts can be used for catalysis of many known organic reactions.\n\nFor biological applications, the surface coating should be polar to give high aqueous solubility and prevent nanoparticle aggregation. In serum or on the cell surface, highly charged coatings promote non-specific binding, whereas polyethylene glycol linked to terminal hydroxyl or methoxy groups repel non-specific interactions. Nanoparticles can be linked to biological molecules that can act as address tags, to direct the nanoparticles to specific sites within the body, specific organelles within the cell, or to follow specifically the movement of individual protein or RNA molecules in living cells. Common address tags are monoclonal antibodies, aptamers, streptavidin or peptides. These targeting agents should ideally be covalently linked to the nanoparticle and should be present in a controlled number per nanoparticle. Multivalent nanoparticles, bearing multiple targeting groups, can cluster receptors, which can activate cellular signaling pathways, and give stronger anchoring. Monovalent nanoparticles, bearing a single binding site, avoid clustering and so are preferable for tracking the behavior of individual proteins.\n\nRed blood cell coatings can help nanoparticles evade the immune system.\n\nNanoparticles present possible dangers, both medically and environmentally.\n\nWhether cosmetics and sunscreens containing nanomaterials pose health risks remains largely unknown at this stage. However considerable research has demonstrated that zinc nanoparticles are not absorbed into the bloodstream in vivo.\n\nConcern has also been raised over the health effects of respirable nanoparticles from certain combustion processes. As of 2013 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was investigating the safety of the following nanoparticles:\n\nAs of 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had conditionally registered, for a period of four years, only two nanomaterial pesticides as ingredients. The EPA differentiates nanoscale ingredients from non-nanoscale forms of the ingredient, but there is little scientific data about potential variation in toxicity. Testing protocols still need to be developed.\n\nAs the most prevalent morphology of nanomaterials used in consumer products, nanoparticles have potential and actual applications in all industries. Table below summarizes the most common nanoparticles used in various product types available on the global markets.\n\nScientific research on nanoparticles is intense as they have many potential applications in medicine, physics, optics, and electronics. The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative offers government funding focused on nanoparticle research.|The use of nanoparticles in laser dye-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) laser gain media was demonstrated in 2003 and it has been shown to improve conversion efficiencies and to decrease laser beam divergence. Researchers attribute the reduction in beam divergence to improved dn/dT characteristics of the organic-inorganic dye-doped nanocomposite. The optimum composition reported by these researchers is 30% w/w of SiO (~ 12 nm) in dye-doped PMMA.|Nanoparticles are being investigated as potential drug delivery system. Drugs, growth factors or other biomolecules can be conjugated to nano particles to aid targeted delivery.

They are roughly the size of a golf ball and often coated in chocolate sprinkles, desiccated coconut, or cocoa. As their name implies, these cookies contain rum. Because they are not baked, the alcohol flavour and kick are not lost during preparation. This cookie is especially popular during the holiday season.\nRum balls are a popular Christmas treat in England, Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United States, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. In Denmark they are enjoyed year round and known as either \"romkugle\", \"trøffel\" or \"sputnik\", depending on the region.\n\nThere are many different ways to make rum balls, as recipes vary from region to region and family to family. All rum balls must include chocolate and rum, but the rest of the ingredients vary in kind, form, and amount.\n\nTo make rum balls, the cake (or biscuit) material is crushed and mixed with fat, cocoa and a moist binding ingredient, such as jam or condensed milk. Other optional ingredients can also be added, such as nuts. When the mixture holds together firmly, it is rolled into balls and then coated.\n\nIn Hungary they are made in a similar way, but usually rolled in sugar. Ground walnut and raisins are sometimes added to the rum ball ingredients. Some Hungarian rum balls are made with whole cherries placed inside the balls, and then rolled in coconut flakes ().\n\nRum balls closely resemble brigadeiros, a Brazilian sweet; however, brigadeiros are made from condensed milk.\n\nThe world's largest rum ball was created in Mejdal, Denmark on 11 June 2017, weighing .\n\n\n\n"}

It is also made in camping situations in New Zealand, and has been for many decades.\n\nDamper was originally developed by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for long periods, with only basic rations of flour, sugar and tea, supplemented by whatever meat was available. The damper has influences from European baking and indigenous bush bread which was eaten by Australian Aboriginals for thousands of years. The basic ingredients of damper were flour, water, and sometimes milk. Baking soda could be used for leavening. The damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the camp fire. The ashes were flattened, and the damper was cooked there for ten minutes. Following this, the damper was covered with ashes and cooked for another 20 to 30 minutes until the damper sounded hollow when tapped. Alternatively, the damper was cooked in a greased camp oven. Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup.\n\n"}

Its diminutive, \"target\", came to mean an object to be aimed at in the 18th century.\n\nThe term refers to various types of shields used by infantry troops from the 13th to 16th centuries, or earlier. More specifically, a targe was a concave shield fitted with enarmes on the inside, one adjustable by a buckle, to be attached to the forearm, and the other fixed as a grip for the left hand. These shields were mostly made of iron or iron-plated wood. From the 15th century, the term could also refer to special shields used for jousting. A fair number were created wholly for show.\n\nFrom the early 17th century, until the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Scottish Highlander's main means of defence in battle was his targe. After the disastrous defeat of the Jacobites at Culloden, the carrying of the targe had been banned, and many were destroyed, or put to other uses. Those that remain have intricate patterns, and are decorated, indicating that they would have originally belonged to important people.\n\nTarges are generally round shields between 18 in and 21 in (45–55 cm) in diameter. The inside of the targe was formed from two very thin layers of flat wooden boards, with the grain of each layer at right angles to the other. They were fixed together with small wooden pegs, forming plywood. The front was covered with a tough cowhide, which was often decorated with embossed Celtic style patterns. This was fixed to the wood with many brass, or in some cases, silver, nails, and occasionally brass plates were also fixed to the face for strength and decoration. Some targes had center bosses of brass, and a few of these could accept a long steel spike, which screwed into a small \"puddle\" of lead that was fixed to the wood, under the boss. When not in use, the spike could be unscrewed and placed in a sheath on the back of the targe. A Highlander was usually armed with a broadsword or dagger in one hand and a spiked targe on his other arm for close combat.\n\nThe back of the targe was commonly covered in deerskin, and a very few had some packing of straw etc. behind this. Some targes, usually those actually used in battle, had their backs covered in a piece of red cloth taken from the uniform of a government soldier (a \"Redcoat\") that the owner had killed in battle. Although all the old targes show signs of handles and arm straps, of various designs including centre-grips, there is very little evidence to indicate that there was any guige strap for carrying the targe over the shoulder.\n\nThe face of a targe typically used two general patterns – concentric circles, or a centre boss with subsidiary bosses around this. There are a few notable exceptions, such as a targe in Perth Museum in Scotland that is of a star design. Although some targe designs appear to have been more popular than others, there is very little to indicate that there ever were \"clan\" designs (though every clansman would have had a heraldic coat of arms). The nearest that one might come to finding a \"clan\" design is four identical targes from the family armoury at Castle Grant. It appears more likely that targe designs were individual to their owner. During the 1745/46 Jacobite uprising, a William Lindsay, a shieldwright in Perth made hundreds of targes for Charles Edward Stuart's army. He made a distinction in price between an \"officer's targe\" and an ordinary targe.\n\n\n"}

It reflects a similar mix of influences: a pre-Christian pantheon and other beings equivalent to those of Norse mythology; magical characters (sometimes recognisably pre-Christian) associated with Christian festivals, and various regional 'character' stories.\n\nAs in Scandinavia, when belief in the old gods disappeared, remnants of the mythos persisted: Holda, a \"supernatural\" patron of spinning; the Lorelei, a dangerous Rhine siren derived from 19th century literature; the spirit Berchta (also known as Perchta); the Weisse Frauen, a water spirit said to protect children; the Wild Hunt (in German folklore preceded by an old man, Honest Eckart, who warns others of its approach); the giant Rübezahl; changeling legends; and many more generic entities such as the elf, dwarf, kobold and erlking.\n\nPopular folklore includes Krampus and Knecht Ruprecht, a rough companion to Santa Claus; the Lutzelfrau, a Yule witch who must be appeased with small presents; the Osterhase (Easter Hare - the original Easter Bunny); and Walpurgisnacht, a spring festival derived from pagan customs.\n\nCharacter folklore includes the stories of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the trickster hero Till Eulenspiegel, the Town Musicians of Bremen and Faust.\n\nDocumentation and preservation of folklore in the states that formally united as Germany in 1871 was initially fostered in the 18th and 19th centuries. As early as 1851, author Bernhard Baader published a collection of folklore research obtained by oral history, called \"Volkssagen aus dem Lande Baden und den angrenzenden Gegenden.\" The Saxon author Johann Karl August Musäus was another early collector. \n\nStudy was further promoted by the Prussian poet and philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder. His belief in the role of folklore in ethnic nationalism - a folklore of Germany as a nation rather than of disunited German-speaking peoples - inspired the Brothers Grimm, Goethe and others. For instance, folklore elements, such as the Rhine Maidens and the Grimms' \"The Story of a Boy Who Went Forth to Learn Fear\", formed part of the source material for Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nSome of the works of Washington Irving - notably Rip van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - are based on German folktales.\n\nWithin Germany, the nationalistic aspect was further emphasised during the National Socialist era. Folklore studies, Volkskunde, were co-opted as a political tool, to seek out traditional customs to support the idea of historical continuity with a Germanic culture. Anti-Semitic folklore such as the blood libel legend was also emphasized.\n\n\n"}

The cereal is distinguished by its characteristic brown checkered squares, with a finer pattern than Chex cereal.\n\nAdvertisements for Life cereal sport the slogan \"\"Life\" is full of surprises\". , with the advent of numerous specialty varieties, the original cereal is now marketed as \"Life Original Multigrain Cereal\" with 20 grams of whole grains promoted in a red heart symbol. There is also the claim that: \"Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods and low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease.\"\n\nLife was popularized during the 1970s by an advertising campaign featuring \"Little Mikey,\" a hard-to-please four-year-old boy portrayed by John Gilchrist. His two older brothers were portrayed by his real-life brothers, Michael and Tommy. The commercials featured the slogan/catchphrase \"He likes it! Hey Mikey!\" That ad campaign ran from 1972 to 1986, becoming one of the longest-running television advertisements in history. As recently as 1999, the commercial was included in a list of \"memorable ads\". A subsequent commercial repeated the scenario with the same dialog, but used lumberjacks instead of children. \n\nEarlier, when Life cereal was first introduced in the 1960s, the original slogan was, \"The most useful protein ever in a ready-to-eat cereal\". The original mascots (in commercials narrated by Paul Frees) were little munchkin-like characters.\n\nIn 1978, Cinnamon Life was introduced, followed shortly thereafter by Raisin Life. Today, Cinnamon Life accounts for one third of total Life sales. Raisin Life sold poorly and was discontinued in the mid 1980s.\n\nIn 2002, a short-lived version called Baked Apple Life was released. Honey Graham Life was introduced in early 2004, Life Vanilla Yogurt Crunch in late 2005, and another new flavor, Life Chocolate Oat Crunch, in 2006. All three were eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\nFinally, in 2008, Quaker introduced another new version, Maple & Brown Sugar Life.

Produced by Nestlé, Milo was originally developed by Australian inventor Thomas Mayne in 1934. It is marketed and sold in many countries.\n\nMost commonly sold as a powder in a green tin, often depicting various sporting activities, Milo is available as a premixed beverage in some countries, and has been subsequently developed into a snack bar and breakfast cereal. Its composition and taste differ in some countries.\n\nMilo maintains significant popularity in a diverse range of territories, including Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines, Indonesia, Chile, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Peru and Central and West Africa.\n\nMilo is manufactured by evaporating the water content from a thick syrup at reduced pressure. The thick opaque syrup is obtained from malted wheat or barley that is sourced from companies that produce these raw products. In 2016, Nestle Philippines stated that it will begin to produce Milo using its \"protomalt\" formulation sometime in 2017. The protomalt is composed of carbohydrates derived from barley and cassava.\n\nIn 1934, Australian industrial chemist and inventor Thomas Mayne developed Milo and launched it at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Milo began production at the plant located in Smithtown, near Kempsey on the North Coast of New South Wales. The name was derived from the famous ancient athlete Milo of Croton, after his legendary strength.\n\nMilo is sometimes sprinkled on ice cream or breakfast cereals. Milo is often the favoured beverage for the Tim Tam Slam.. \n\nMilo manufactured outside Australia is customised for local methods of preparation. In Malaysia and Singapore as well as Brunei and some other parts of Asia, Milo with ice added is known as \"Iced Milo\"\nor \"Milo Ais\" in Malay Language. (alternatively, \"bing\" or \"peng\", meaning ice in Cantonese and Hokkien respectively). Iced milo is even available at fast food restaurants such as KFC and McDonald's. Milo is also served locally in kopitiams and mamak stalls in versions such as \"Milo Dinosaur\" (a cup of Milo with an extra spoonful of undissolved Milo powder added on top of it), \"Milo Godzilla\" (a cup of Milo with ice cream and/or topped with whipped cream)\"Neslo\" (combined with Nescafé powdered coffee) and \"Milo Mangkuk\" (Iced Milo that is served with plastic and put it inside a bowl). The Milo powder is also usually used in the making of Batik cake. In Hong Kong, Milo is served in Cha chaan teng.\n\nMilo is also a famous beverage in Indian Muslim stalls, or fondly known as Mamak stalls in Malaysia. It is also sometimes used as an alternative to jam and spread on bread or also as an ingredient in Roti Canai, and is usually called \"Roti Milo\".\n\nIn Australia and most other countries, the packaging is green and depicts people playing various sports on the tin. A higher malt content form also existed in Australia and was marketed in a brown coloured tin which was usually only available in the 375g size. As of May 2015, this form is no longer manufactured. An organisation called MILO in2CRICKET, which operates in most areas by volunteers, teaches girls and boys the skills of the game.\n\nMilo's commercials and taglines are \"Go and go and go with Milo\". A recent Australian commercial incorporating this slogan depicts four generations of women on a skipping rope singing \"and my mum gave me Milo to go and go and go.\" The tag \"I need my Milo Today\" is also used. The packaging of tins of Milo in Malaysia and Singapore are also green and also have people playing sports on the tins, giving it the affectionate name of \"Tak Kiu\", which is Hokkien Chinese for football. In Colombia, Milo is closely tied to football, and the slogan several generations have sung is \"Milo te da energía, la meta la pones tú\" (\"Milo gives you the energy, you set the goal\").\n\nMilo is very popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the brand name is synonymous with chocolate flavoured drinks: Milo has a 90% market share in Malaysia (not the often quoted 90% worldwide share of Milo consumption), and Malaysians were said to be the world's largest consumers of Milo. This is because Milo was once used as a nutrient supplement when it was first introduced in the country, and has thus gained a reputation as a 'must have' drink for the old and the younger generations. Milo manufactured in Malaysia is made to dissolve well in hot water to produce a smooth hot chocolate drink, or with ice added for a cold drink. \"Milo Vans\" were often associated with sports days in these two countries, during which primary school pupils would queue up to collect their cups of Milo drinks using coupons.\n\nIn Peru, during the 1970s military dictatorship, Milo labels displayed Peruvian motifs, such as photos and pictures of Peruvian towns, history, crops, fruits, animals, plants, as an educational aid. After 1980, when the military left power, sports predominated on the labels.\n\nNestlé has now introduced a Canadian version of Milo. It dissolves rapidly like Nesquik, probably due to market expectations, but still retains the malt flavour. It is also sweeter than other varieties. This Milo as the brand has been in Eastern Canada since the late 1970s with the influx of people from previous British colonial territories such as the Caribbean and Hong Kong, and India. It was available in most small ethnic grocery stores, especially Caribbean food stores. It has recently been selling at larger chains to beef up their share in the ethnic market in Canada, and is now available in places like Superstore, Extra Foods and London Drugs. Some East Asian supermarkets (such as T&T Supermarket in Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto, and Calgary) will carry the version imported from China or Hong Kong.\n\nAside from the International section of specific grocery stores and certain Asian grocery stores, Nestlé does not market Milo in the United States. In 2017 the Colombian manufactured Milo has started appearing on shelves in supermarkets in the United States such as Walmart (Alongside Hispanic sections), and King Soopers (Denver CO).\n\nIt can also be found in the United Kingdom in some Sainsbury's and Tesco supermarkets, which import it from Kenya and South Africa. Asian food specialists, such as Mini Siam Oriental Foods and Hoo Hing also stock it. A similar product called Ovaltine is most popular with UK consumers.\n\nIn Ireland, it can be found in many Asian or African stores. Typically they will stock Kenyan or Filipino Milo.\n\nIn China, it is commonly sold in western supermarkets, but also smaller convenience stores. Usually packaged in a 240gram flexible foil pouch, single drink packets can also be purchased. The Milo itself contains more milk solids than the Australian Milo, and so it is not necessary to add milk before consumption.\n\nIn the past, it was available in Portugal and Brazil. Nestlé Brazil discontinued production of Milo in Brazil, to focus on the much-popular domestic brands Nescau and Nesquik. The Chilean version of Milo is still in production and is identical in taste and texture to the one that was once produced in Brazil.\n\nIn May 2013, and after more than 20 years out of the Portuguese market, Nestlé reintroduced the brand aiming at the high-end market.\n\nMilo contains 1,680 kJ (402 calories) in every 100 g of the powder, mostly from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can be used for energy by the body, which is the basis of Milo being marketed as an energy drink. Most of the carbohydrate content is sugar. The New Zealand version of Milo is 46 per cent sugar.\n\nMilo dissolved in water has a Glycemic Index (GI) of 55, the same as Coca-Cola. However, milk has a much lower GI of 30 - 33, so mixing a very small amount of Milo into a mug of milk yields an overall GI closer to 33, and mixing a large amount of Milo into a mug of milk will give a GI closer to 55.\n\nThe Milo website states that the drink is high in calcium, iron and the vitamins B, B, B, B. Milo is advertised as containing \"Actigen-E\", but this is just Nestlé's trademarked name for the vitamins in the Milo recipe.\n\nMilo contains some theobromine, a xanthine alkaloid similar to caffeine which is present in the cocoa used in the product.\n\nMilo is available as a snack in cube form, in Nigeria, Ghana and Dubai.\n\nMilo is available as Milo nuggets and cereal balls in South East Asia.\n\nIn Australia, a new version of Milo called Milo B-Smart was released in 2008 (the original and malt Milo varieties remain); which is of a finer texture and has added B vitamins and iodine. It has a different taste from the original Milo formula and is marketed as a health food for children.\n\n"}

Each 45.2% alcohol by volume (90.4 US Proof) bottle bears a unique batch and bottle number. The brand was introduced in 1996.\n\nThe Woodford Reserve Distillery, formerly known as the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery and later the Labrot & Graham Distillery, is approximately eight miles from the town of Versailles in north-central Kentucky, off U.S. Route 60 between Interstate 64 and Versailles.\n\nDistilling began on the site of the current day distillery in 1812. Although the site has not been continuously operational as a distillery since, the structure stands as one of the oldest distilleries in Kentucky. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is designated as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nOriginally established by Elijah Pepper, the distillery was passed on to his son and known as the Oscar Pepper Distillery when Dr. James Crow worked there in the mid-19th century. During this time Dr. Crow undertook a series of activities that improved and codified the understanding and quality of key bourbon-making processes such as sour-mash fermentation, pot still distillation and barrel maturation. After Oscar Pepper died in 1867 the distillery was passed to his son James E. Pepper. The Pepper family sold the property to Leopold Labrot and James Graham in 1878, who owned and operated it (except during Prohibition) until it was sold to the Brown-Forman Corporation in 1941. Brown-Forman operated it until the late 1960s, then sold the property and its accompanying acreage to a local farmer. Brown-Forman re-purchased the property in 1993, refurbished it, and brought it back into operation. The Woodford Reserve brand was introduced to the market in 1996.\n\nThe distillery produces: Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey, and Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey. It also distills some limited edition releases, including Woodford Reserve Master's Collection, Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Batch Proof, a Kentucky-only Distillery Series, and a special commemorative bottle it releases annually in conjunction with its official sponsorship of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nInternational Spirit ratings organizations and liquor review bodies have generally given Woodford Reserve solid scores. At the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Woodford Reserve's best performances have been in 2005 and 2013, winning a double gold medal each time. It has also won gold (2006–2007, 2011-2012) and silver (2008, 2010) medals at this annual event. The \"Beverage Testing Institute\" has given the Reserve scores of between 90 and 91 and \"Wine Enthusiast\" awarded it a 90-95 point rating. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, the Beverage Testing Institute, and others, ranks Woodford Reserve in its highest (\"Tier 1\") scoring category.\n\nThe Woodford Reserve Distillery offers tours and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail promotional programs.\nIn a contract arrangement with Churchill Downs, Woodford Reserve has been declared the \"official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby\" and is used in a $1,000 mint julep cocktail that is sold to patrons on Derby Day. (Although Woodford Reserve is the Derby's \"official bourbon\", its sister brand Old Forester serves mint juleps as the \"official drink\" and is featured in the more moderately priced juleps served at the event.)\n\nWoodford Reserve's parent company Brown-Forman has entered into a 5 year deal with Churchill Downs to become the title sponsor of the Kentucky Derby after Yum! Brands pulled their sponsorship. The \"Greatest Two Minutes in Sports will now be called \"the Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve.” \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1252899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1252899", "title": "Hagwon", "text": "Hagwon\n\nHagwon () is the Korean-language word for a for-profit private institute, academy or cram school prevalent in South Korea. Although most widely known for their role as \"cram schools\", where children can study to improve scores, hagwon actually perform several educational functions:supplementary education that many children need just to keep up with the regular school curriculum, remedial education for the children who fall behind in their work, training in areas not covered in schools, and preparation for students striving to improve test scores and preparing for the high school and university entrance examinations (the university entrance exam is also called suneung (수능)). Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic hagwon for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and taekwondo (태권도). Most young children attend a hagwon. Hagwon also play a social role; occasionally children ask to be sent because their friends attend. There also exist hagwon for adults, such as flower arrangement and driving instruction hagwon. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar institutions operated by Korean Americans in the United States.\n\nChildren of all ages often attend hagwon, even those in the pre-school age bracket. It is not uncommon for students to be enrolled in several hagwon of different subject areas at once in addition to their normal school attendance. Hagwon often specialize in subjects like mathematics, foreign languages, science, arts, or music. Many hagwon also have adults as students, particularly those dedicated to teaching the English language.\n\nWhile some see hagwon as filling a need not being adequately met by the public school system, others see them as creating an unequal footing between the poor and rich in Korea.\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that there were over 70,000 hagwon in South Korea with 47 percent of them focused on high school enrollment.\n\nIn 1885, Henry Appenzeller founded the Paichai school (배재대학교) as a cover for his missionary work. At the time it was illegal to preach other religions in Korea. Although his main goal was to spread his faith, it was still used by Koreans to learn English.\n\nPrivate education, known as \"gwaoe\" (과외), was banned by President Chun Doo-hwan (전두환) in 1980. It was felt the advantage of private education unfairly burdened the poor and to promote equality, all access to it was made illegal. Through the years the government has relaxed the restrictions on private education by increasingly allowing more individuals and organizations to offer private education until the ban was ruled unconstitutional in the 1990s.\n\nKorean courts have ruled that it may violate the constitution for the government to limit the amount of money hagwon can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors to make up for lost study time. Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67 percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.\n\nIn March 2008, the government prohibited school teachers from creating test questions for hagwons. It had been found that some teachers were leaking tests and test questions to hagwons, giving the students who attended those schools advantages when it came time to take the test.\n\nA petition was made in October 2009 by parents, teachers, students and hagwon owners to challenge the government's legislation regarding hagwon closing times in Seoul and Busan. The constitutional court ruled that the laws did not violate the constitution. The restriction was put in place for Seoul and Busan in the summer of 2009. In making the ruling the court said, \"Because it’s important to secure sleep for high school students to overcome fatigue and for the sake of their growth, it’s difficult to say that [the ban] excessively restricts basic rights.\"\n\nIn April 2010 it was reported that there were over 25,000 hagwon registered with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, with nearly 6,000 being in the Gangnam area. It was also revealed that local government councils other than Seoul had decided not to implement the 22:00 curfew. The curfew was seen as not having an impact on education fees and not addressing the real concern with private education. Despite the curfew, there have been attempts to get around this curfew among hagwon in Seoul.\n\nA higher than average concentration of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as the primary reason for an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300 percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.\n\nNative English speakers were hired as early as 1883 in Korea, originally out of need. The first teacher hired at the government-run Tongmunhak was Thomas Hallifax. Due to the preference for having native English speakers teach English, many native English-speakers are still hired to teach at hagwons in Korea. These hagwons may be only English schools or they could also be schools which have a variety of subjects including English. The minimum requirements for foreigners for such teaching positions are: citizenship of Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or the United States, a clean criminal background check at the national level, and a bachelor's degree obtained in one of the aforementioned countries. In return for signing a one-year contract, the institute provides an instructor with a monthly salary, round-trip airfare from his or her country of origin, usually a rent-free apartment or housing stipend for the duration of the instructor's contract, and an additional one-month \"severance pay\" at the completion of the contract.\n\nForeign instructors hold a mixed view of hagwons. Many instructors have had no significant issues with the hagwon they've worked at.\n\nHagwon owners have complained about the challenge in finding truly qualified teachers. A group of English instructors first formed a labour union at a hagwon in 2005.\n\nIn some English-speaking countries, hagwon exist for ethnic Koreans. In North America, about 75% of Korean-language supplemental schools have affiliation with churches. As of 2006, of the hagwon registered with the Korean School Association of America (KSAA), over 75% were affiliated with Korean churches. There are also secular formal hagwon and secular informal hagwon. The \"hagwon\" are equivalent to \"hoshū jugyō kō\" (\"hoshūkō\") in ethnic Japanese communities and \"buxiban\" in ethnic Chinese communities. As of 2010, every year over 50,000 Korean Americans attend Korean heritage schools.\n\nKorean schools were first established in Hawaii after 1903, when the first wave of Korean immigration came to the United States. The modern generation of Korean supplemental schools were first established in the United States in the 1970s. At the time they were weekend schools that had a mission to preserve the Korean-American identity in its students. They taught the Korean language, managed the assimilation of Korean-American children, and offered afterschool tutoring programs. There were almost 500 schools registered with the KSAA by the end of the 1980s. Beginning in the 1990s there were also \"hagwon\" that were supplementary academic preparation programs like the ones in Korea.\n\nKang Hee-Ryong, author of the PhD thesis \"White supremacy, racialization, and cultural politics of Korean Heritage Language Schools\", wrote that the Korean heritage schools are \"not simply a means of counter hegemony against the racializing forces\" but instead the \"product of compromises\" between different generations of Korean Americans.\n\n\n\n"}

Filo-based pastries are made by layering many sheets of filo brushed with oil or butter; the pastry is then baked.\n\nThe current practice of stretching raw dough into paper-thin sheets likely originated in the kitchens of the Topkapı Palace during the time of the Ottoman Empire, based on Central Asian and Romano-Byzantine techniques. Baklava is probably the earliest dish using filo, and is documented as early as the 13th century.\n\nFilo dough is made with flour, water, and a small amount of oil or white vinegar, though some dessert recipes also call for egg yolks. Homemade filo takes time and skill, requiring progressive rolling and stretching to a single thin and very large sheet. A very big table and a long roller are used, with continual flouring between layers to prevent tearing.\n\nMachines for producing filo pastry were perfected in the 1970s, and have come to dominate the market. Filo for domestic use is widely available from supermarkets, fresh or frozen.\n\nWhen using filo to make pastries, the thin layers are made by first rolling out the sheets of dough to the final thickness, then brushing them with oil, or melted butter for some desserts, and stacking them. This contrasts with puff pastry and croissant doughs, where the layers are stacked into a thick layer of dough, then folded and rolled out multiple times to produce a laminated dough containing thin layers of dough and fat.\n\nFilo can be used in many ways: layered, folded, rolled, or ruffled, with various fillings. Notable pastries made with filo include:\n\nVery thin pastry sheets can also be made by touching lumps of dough to a hot surface, as in the North African \"malsouka\" or by cooking very thin batters, as in the South Indian \"pootharekulu\".\n\nAlthough filo's roots are in Ottoman cuisine, the English term comes from the Greek name, which means \"leaf\".\n\nA popular Albanian dish called flia, or fli, may have been an early form of filo. In Albanian, fije/fli translates as both \"sheet\" and \"leaf\" (pl. flete/gjethe) just like φύλλο in Greek.\n\nThe Turkish name \"yufka\" means both the thin dough used for baklava and börek, and a kind of flatbread, also called sac ekmeği, cooked on a sac, a domed metal plate. The bread form may have been \"an early form of filo\" since the \"Kitab Diwan Lughat al-Turk\", a dictionary of Turkic dialects by Mahmud Kashgari recorded plated/folded bread as one meaning of the word \"yuvgha\".\n\nFilo is known by a variety of names in ethnic and regional cuisines.

Its name comes from the brewery located in the Upper Silesia town of Tychy. The brand is brewed by the Princely Brewery Tychy (Polish \"Tyskie Browary Książęce\"), part of the Kompania Piwowarska brewery group, itself a subsidiary of SABMiller since 1999 as a result of the merger of two SABMiller owned Polish breweries, the Lech Browary Wielkopolski (Lech Brewery Greater Poland) in Poznań, and the Tyskie Browary Książęce in Tychy.\n\nAsahi Group Holdings acquired the brand from Anheuser-Busch InBev in December, 2016.\n\nThe main brands are Tyskie Gronie (pale lager).\n\nThe brewery is one of the oldest in Europe and at their location in Tychy withstood numerous historical border partitions of Poland. Beer has been produced in Tychy continuously for almost 400 years. From 1629, the brewery, then known in German as the \"Fürstliche Brauerei Tichau\" (Princely Brewery Tychy), was in the ownership of the German noble . From 1861, the brewery became known as the \"Fürstliche Brauerei in Tichau\" (Princely Brewery in Tychy) and came under the management of from the German princely (German \"Fürsten\") House of Pless. Between 1918 and 1939, the brewery merged with neighbouring competing companies, but came under provisional administration of the Polish state intermittently from 1934 due to unpaid taxes. During World War II, the brewery was put under the management of the occupying authorities.\n\nIn its beginnings, the brewery produced three kinds of beer: mailings, yeast and tableware. Only the high quality beer was intended for sale, and the other two were a beer allowance drunk mainly by brewers and their families. In the early nineteenth century the brewery produced only two beverages: beer and Bavarian malt, both top-fermenting. Bavarian malt with a classical composition, saturated color was brown, sweet, and low-hopped. The standard favorite was the dark niskoekstraktowe, weak and only for immediate consumption. After the expansion of the brewery in the nineteenth century and the introduction of bottom-fermenting, they started to produce Tyskie lager, a relatively short Bavarian beer. The first beers were light and were sold under the Książęce brand. In the interwar period, popular brands from Tyskie were the Książęce Tyskie Pilsen (Princely Tychy Pilsner), the Książęce Tyskie Export, the Książęce Tyskie Beer full, and Tyskie Porter.\n\nTyskie is one of the leading brands of beer in Poland, with around 18% of the Polish market. Tyskie also has a large export distribution through its parent SABMiller company. The main export brands are Tyskie Gronie, a 5.0% pale lagerTyskie Gronie is 5.2% [[Alcohol by volume(ABV) in produced by Tychy Brewery.\n\nTyskie bottles are known for their distinctive white packaging.

Chromosomal rearrangements are an important source of this variation. The term somaclonal variation is a phenomenon of broad taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated and non-cultivated plants. Characters affected include both qualitative and quantitative traits.\n\nSomaclonal variation is not restricted to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic, which in the latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be gene methylation.\nIf no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other plant screening procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation.\n\nThe major likely benefit of somaclonal variation is plant/crop improvement. Somaclonal variation leads to the creation of additional genetic variability. Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during \"in vitro\" culture includes resistance to disease pathotoxins, herbicides, high salt concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites.\n\nSuitable for breeding of new species.\n\nA serious disadvantage of somaclonal variation occurs in operations which require clonal uniformity, as in the horticulture and forestry industries where tissue culture is employed for rapid propagation of elite genotypes.\n\nDifferent steps can be used to reduce somaclonal variation. It is well known that increasing numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation, so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new explants might reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation. Vitrification, commonly referred to as hyperhydricity in the tissue culture world, may be a problem in some species. Hyperhydricity is a physiological malformation that results in excessive hydration, low lignification, impaired stomatal function and reduced mechanical strength of tissue culture-generated plants. In case of forest trees, mature elite trees can be identified and rapidly cloned by this technique.\n\nHigh production cost has limited the application of this technique to more valuable ornamental crops and some fruit trees.\n"}

The southern German variety is soft and similar to Teewurst. Braunschweiger mettwurst is smoked somewhat but still soft and spreadable, while other northern German varieties such as the Holsteiner are harder and more akin to salami, due to longer smoking. The Low German word \"mett\", meaning \"minced pork without bacon\", is derived from the Old Saxon word \"meti\" (meaning \"food\"), and is related to the English word 'meat'. Mettwurst can be prepared and eaten a variety of ways, such as cooked or fried or spread on rye bread with onions and eaten raw. When minced raw pork is prepared without curing or smoking, it is called simply Mett.\n\nIn South Australia, due to its large German immigration in the 19th Century (to, for example, the town of Hahndorf), mettwurst (sometimes spelled metwurst) is very common: it is created in the North German style and served as a cold cut. It is often used in school lunches and as a snack during parties. Well-known South Australian brands of mettwurst include Barossa Fine Foods, Butch's Smallgoods, Kalleske, Linke's, Mullers, Steiney's and Wintulich.\n\nIn the United States, mettwurst is most commonly associated with the city of Cincinnati, where it is regarded as a signature dish. The town of Mineola, Iowa, which was settled almost exclusively by immigrants from Schleswig-Holstein, hosts an annual heritage dinner with \"Schoening-style\" cold-smoked Mettwurst known in the Low German dialect as \"Metvuss\".\n\nIt is important that high quality, fresh ingredients are used otherwise deadly microorganisms and toxins can develop.

The sausage then has to mature for seven to ten days in order to develop its typical taste. Teewurst contains 30 to 40 percent fat, which makes it particularly easy to spread.\nTeewurst was invented in Pomerania, probably in the small Baltic town of Rügenwalde (now Darłowo, Poland), in the middle of the 19th century. The name, which means \"tea sausage\", is said to derive from the habit of serving it in sandwiches at teatime.\n\nUp to 1945, the sausage industry in Rügenwalde was well established, and Teewurst was its best-known product. In 1927, the term \"Rügenwalder Teewurst\" was declared a Protected designation of origin. After World War II, sausage makers from Rügenwalde fled or were expelled to the Federal Republic of Germany, where they established new companies and resumed the production of Teewurst. They established an association of former Rügenwald sausage makers, which registered the trademark \"Rügenwalder Teewurst\" in 1957.

It typically accompanies tamales, and is very popular during the Christmas holiday season (\"las Posadas\").\n\nIn Mexico, the drink typically includes\" masa \"(corn hominy flour), water, \"piloncillo\" (unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon, vanilla, and optional chocolate or fruit. The mixture is blended and heated before serving. \"Atole\" is made by toasting \"masa\" on a \"comal\" (griddle), then adding water that was boiled with cinnamon sticks. The resulting blends vary in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin, liquid consistency. \"Atole\" can also be prepared with rice, wheat, or oatmeal in place of masa. In northern Mexico, a variation is also made using \"pinole\" (sweetened toasted corn meal). Although \"atole\" is one of the traditional drinks of the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead, it is very common during breakfast and dinnertime at any time of year. It is usually sold as street food.\nIn many parts of Mexico and in the United States in communities with Mexican cultural roots, \"atole\" is a traditional comfort food. It is often eaten as a breakfast or an after dinner snack on cold days. In New Mexico, blue corn \"atole\" is finely ground cornmeal toasted for cooking, consumed as a grainy porridge-style drink served warm, usually sweetened with sugar and/or thinned with milk. It is usually served at breakfast like cream of wheat or oatmeal. Elders are said to have drunk \"atole\" because it gave them energy and if a mother is nursing it gives her more milk. Salvadoran varieties include \"atol shuco\" (\"dirty\" \"atol\", a reference to its darker color), particularly popular in the Cabañas region. The Nicaraguan homologue is \"pinolillo\". In some parts of Honduras, fresh corn is ground and the expressed liquid is used as the base (instead of \"masa\").\n\nIn Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador \"atol de elote\" is a popular beverage. Pineapple \"atol\" (\"atol de piña\") is also drunk in El Salvador.\n"}

It is used primarily in incendiary grenades. \n\nThe main chemical reaction in thermate is the same as in thermite: an aluminothermic reaction between powdered aluminium and a metal oxide. In addition to thermite, thermate also contains sulfur and sometimes barium nitrate, both of which increase its thermal effect, create flame in burning, and significantly reduce the ignition temperature. Various mixtures of these compounds can be called thermate, but to avoid confusion with thermate-TH3, one can refer to them as thermite variants or analogs. The composition by weight of Thermate-TH3 (in military use) is 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur and 0.3% binder (such as PBAN). As both thermite and thermate are notoriously difficult to ignite, initiating the reaction normally requires supervision and sometimes persistent effort.\n\nBecause thermate burns at higher temperatures than ordinary thermite, it has military applications in cutting through tank armor or other hardened military vehicles or bunkers. As with thermite, thermate's ability to burn without an external supply of oxygen renders it useful for underwater incendiary devices.\n\n\n"}

They are particularly popular in the Indian subcontinent and Iran.\n\nThis dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water).\n\nThis dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi.\n\nNames for the dish include ; Nepali: जेरी (Jeri), Sanskrit: सुधा-कुण्डलिका, Marathi: जिलबी ; (zelepi); ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Sinhala: පැණි වළලු; Sylheti: ꠎꠤꠟꠣꠚꠤ Zilafi; ; ; Azerbaijani: \"zülbiyə\" (South Azerbaijani: \"زۆلبیه\"); \"źəlobəi\"; Persian: زولبیا \"zoolbia\"; Lurish: زلهیبی \"zuleybi\"; Arabic: \"zalābiyah\" or \"zalebi\"; Somali: Mushabbak, Egyptian Arabic: مِشَبٍك \"Meshabek\", Tunisian Arabic: \"Zlebia\"; ; Harari language: ሙሻበኽ \"Mushabakh\".\n\nZalabia or Luqmat al qadi consisted of a yeast dough fried and then dipped in a syrup of honey and rose water In Christian communities in West Asia, it is served on the Feast of the Theophany (Epiphany), often with dry sugar and cinnamon or confectioners sugar. In Iran, where it is known as \"zolbiya\", the sweet was traditionally given to the poor during Ramadan. A 10th century cookbook gives several recipes for \"zulubiya\". There are several 13th century recipes of the sweet, the most accepted being mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi. It was also mentioned in a tenth century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, that was later translated by Nawal Nasrallah. Ernest A Hamwi, a Syrian immigrant to the United States, is believed to have used the Persian version \"zalabia\" as an early ice cream cone.\n\nAccording to Hobson-Jobson, the Indian word jalebi is derived from the Arabic word \"zulabiya\" or the Persian \"zolbiya\", another name for luqmat al qadi.This recipe was brought to Medieval India by Persian-speaking Turkic invaders. In 15th century India, jalebi was known as \"Kundalika\" or \"Jalavallika\". \"Priyamkarnrpakatha\", a work by the Jain author Jinasura, composed around 1450 CE, mentions jalebi in the context of a dinner held by a rich merchant. \"Gunyagunabodhini\", another Sanskrit work dating before 1600 CE, lists the ingredients and recipe of the dish; these are identical to the ones used to prepare the modern jalebi. The western Asian dish of Zalabia used a different batter and a syrup of honey and rose water, It was in India that the jalebi got its form - crispness, colour and the sticky sweetness.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, it is known as \"Jalebi\" in Hindustani and served with sweetened condensed milk dish, rabri or eaten with kachori and vegetable curry in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. This sweet is called \"jeri\" in Nepal, a word derived from Jangiri and the Mughal Emperor Jahangir.\n\nPani Walalu or \"Undu Walalu\" is a traditional sweet of Sri Lanka prepared by frying a type of doughnut, made by using undu flour and rice flour and soaking in kithul treacle.\n\nIn the Maldives, it is known by the name \"zilēbi\".\n\nIt's known as zoolbia (زولبیا) in Iran, although when translated into English, the spelling has alternatives and can include zolbiya, zulbiā, zulbia, zolbia, and others. In addition to being sweetened with honey and sugar, zoolbias in Iran is also flavoured with saffron or rose water. Often in Iran, zoolbia is served with Persian-style black tea alongside a similar dessert with a different \"egg\" shape, Bamiyeh. These deserts are commonly served during Nowruz (Persian New Year).\n\nZlebia or zlabia is a type of pastry eaten in parts of Northwest Africa, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Libya as well as Morocco. Natural ingredients include flour, yeast, yoghurt, and sugar or honey. This is then mixed with water and commonly two seeds of cardamom (oil for the crackling).\n\nThese are found in the Levant and other Middle Eastern countries, including the Arab countries of Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Comoros. Zalābiya or zalabia, zalabiya (زلابية) (Maghrebi Arabic: زلابية) are fried dough foods, including types similar to straight doughnuts. Zalābiya are made from a batter composed of eggs, flour and milk, and then cooked in oil. They are made by a zalbāni. Unlike jalebi, zalabia may have a different shape, more like a free-form doughnut or a ball (but this is depending on the exact region and culture), and it may contain cinnamon, lemon, and powdered sugar.\n\nZalābiya mushabbaka are latticed fritters made in discs, balls and squares. They are dipped in clarified honey perfumed with rose water, musk and camphor. A recipe from a caliph's kitchen suggests milk, clarified butter, sugar and pepper to be added.\n\nZalābiya funiyya is a \"sponge cake\" version cooked in a special round pot on a trivet and cooked in a \"tannur\".

The primary examples of therapeutic foods are used for emergency feeding of malnourished children or to supplement the diets of persons with special nutrition requirements, such as the elderly. For liquid nutrition products fed via tube feeding see Medical foods.\n\nTherapeutic foods are usually made of a mixture of protein, carbohydrate, lipid and vitamins and minerals. Therapeutic foods are usually produced by grinding all ingredients together and mixing them. “The mixing process allows for the protein and carbohydrate components of the food to be embedded in the lipid matrix. The size of the particles in the mixture has to be less than 200 µm for the mixture to maintain its consistency. Using this method, the therapeutic food is produced and packaged without using water, which would eliminate the issue of spoilage. Some therapeutic foods require the addition of water before administering, while others can be consumed as-is. Therapeutic foods are designed and manufactured to ensure that they are ready to eat straight from the packaging. Those foods resist bacterial contamination and require no cooking.\n\nA subset of therapeutic foods, ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), are energy-dense, micronutrient-enriched pastes that have a nutritional profile similar to the traditional F-100 milk-based diet used in inpatient therapeutic feeding programs and are often made of peanuts, oil, sugar and milk powder.\n\nRUTFs are a “homogeneous mixture of lipid-rich and water-soluble foods.” The lipids used in formulating RUTFs are in a viscous liquid form. The other ingredients are in small particles and are mixed through the lipid. The other ingredients are protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. The mixture needs to be homogeneous for it to be effectively consumed. To do this, a specific mixing process is needed. The fat/lipid component of the RUTF is heated and stirred first. The heat should be maintained for the lipid to remain in the optimum form for mixing in the other ingredients. The powdered protein, carbohydrate, and vitamins and minerals are then slowly and gradually added to the lipid, while the lipid is being vigorously stirred. After all the ingredients are added and vigorous stirring is maintained, the mixture is then stirred with more speed and for several minutes. If the powdered ingredients have a particle size that is larger than 200 µm, the mixture starts to separate; the particle size needs to be maintained at less than 200 µm.\n\nThe most common RUTFs are made of four ingredients: sugar, dried skimmed milk, oil, and vitamin and mineral supplement (CMV). Other qualities that RUTFs should have included a texture that is soft or crushable and a taste is acceptable and suitable for young children. RUTFs should be ready to eat without needing to be cooked. A very important characteristic is that the RUTFs have a long shelf-life and that they are micro-organism contamination resistant, without the need for expensive packaging. Since the ingredients need to be suspended in liquid, the liquid used in producing RUTFs needs to be fat/lipid. 50% of the protein forming RUTFs should come from dairy products.\n\nUNICEF specifications for RUTFs say that the vitamin and mineral premix must be sourced from one of the following vendors authorized by the World Food Program: DSM Nutrition/Fortitech, Nicholas Piramal Healthcare Ltd (now Piramal Group), Hexagon Nutrition, BASF (SternVitamin), and the GAIN premix facility.\n\nRUTFs are used by UNICEF Kid Power malnutrition program, which uses celebrities to go on \"global missions\" to help save impoverished areas in Africa.\n\nThe standard treatment of childhood malnutrition is administered in two phases. Phase one usually deals with children who are severely malnourished and very ill as a result. The therapy used in this phase is F-75, a milk-based liquid food containing modest amounts of energy and protein (75 kcal/100 mL and 0.9 g protein/100 mL) and the administration of parenteral antibiotics. When an improvement in the child’s appetite and clinical condition is observed, the child is entered into phase two of the treatment. This phase uses F-100. F-100 is a “specially formulated, high-energy, high-protein (100 kcal/100 mL, 2.9 g protein/100 mL) milk-based liquid food”. The child is in phase two until he/she is no longer wasted [weight-for-height z score (WHZ) 2]. Phase two starts while the child is at the hospital but is usually completed after the child goes home. The parent is then responsible for feeding the child a flour supplement made of cereal and legumes as a replacement for the milk-based foods used in phases one and two.\n\nThe World Health Organization's standards for the treatment of malnutrition in children specify the use of two formulas during initial treatment, F-75 and F-100. These formulas contain a mixture of powdered milk, sugar, and other ingredients designed to provide an easily absorbed mix of carbohydrates and essential micronutrients. They are generally provided as powdered mixes which are reconstituted with water. The WHO recommends the use of these formulas, with the gradual introduction of other foods, until the child approaches a normal weight.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of ready to use therapeutic food within the person's own home for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children under five years of age.\n\nAs of 2013, Plumpy'nut had been used to relieve malnutrition in thousands of African children, gaining approval as a therapeutic food from the World Health Organization.\n\n"}

This tribe occupied territory neighbouring that of the Germanic people and seem to have been referred to by the proto-Germanic name \"*Walhaz\" (plural \"*Walhōz\", adjectival form \"*walhiska-\"). It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Celtic Volcae, because application of Grimm's law to that word produces the form \"*Walh-\". Subsequently, this term \"*Walhōz\" was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as Walchgau and Walchensee in Bavaria. These southern neighbours, however, were then already completely Romanised. Thus, Germanic speakers generalised this name first to all Celts, and later to all Romans. Old High German \"Walh\" became \"Walch\" in Middle High German, and the adjective OHG \"walhisk\" became MHG \"welsch\", e.g. in the 1240 Alexander romance by Rudolf von Ems – resulting in \"Welsche\" in Early New High German and modern Swiss German as the exonym for all Romance speakers. For instance, the historical German name for Trentino, the part of Tyrol with a Romance speaking majority, is \"Welschtirol\", and the historical German name for Verona is \"Welschbern\".\n\nToday, \"welsch\" is not in usage in German except in Switzerland. This term is used there not only in a historical context, but also as a somewhat pejorative word to describe Swiss speakers of Italian and French.\n\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, the word for Romance peoples was borrowed from the Goths (as *\"walhs\") into Proto-Slavic some time before the 7th century. The first source using the word was the writings of Byzantine historian George Kedrenos in the mid-11th century.\n\nFrom the Slavs the term passed to other peoples, such as the Hungarians (\"oláh\", referring to Vlachs, more specifically Romanians, \"olasz\", referring to Italians), Turks (\"Ulahlar\") and Byzantines (\"Βλάχοι\", \"Vláhi\") and was used for all Latin people of the Balkans.\n\nOver time, the term \"Vlach\" (and its different forms) also acquired different meanings. Ottoman Turks in the Balkans commonly used the term to denote native Balkan Christians (possibly due to the cultural link between Christianity and Roman culture), and in parts of the Balkans the term came to denote \"shepherd\" – from the occupation of many of the Vlachs throughout Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Polish words \"Włoch\" (pl. \"Włosi\"), \"Italian\", and \"Włochy\", \"Italy\", and the Slovenian \"lah\", a mildly derogatory word for \"Italian\", can also be mentioned.\n\nNumerous names of non-Germanic, and in particular Romance-speaking, European and near-Asian regions derive from the word \"Walh\", in particular the exonyms\nConsider the following terms historically present in several Central and Eastern European, and other neighbouring languages:\n\nIn Western European languages:\nIn the Pennsylvania German language, \"Welsch\" generally means \"strange\" as well as \"Welsh\", and is sometimes, although with a more restricted meaning, compounded with other words. For example, the words for \"turkey\" are \"Welschhaahne\" and \"Welschhinkel\", which literally mean \"French (or Roman) chicken\". \"Welschkann\" is the word for maize and literally translates to \"French (or Roman) grain.\" The verb \"welsche\" means \"to jabber\".\n\nThe Yiddish term \"Velsh\" or \"Veilish\" is used for Sephardi Jews and the Rashi script.\n\nThe element also shows up in family names:\n\n\n\n"}

To update its image, the company hired designer and photographer Charles Wilp who created a controversial and attention-grabbing marketing campaign which positioned the brand at the cutting edge. \n\nThe market share of Afri-Cola continued to dwindle during the 1980s and 1990s. Eventually, in 1998, German beverage company Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG bought all rights to Afri-Cola and Bluna. This company changed the recipe of Afri-Cola in 1998. The taste of the 1998 drink also differed from that of the original. Also, until 1998 the caffeine content was 250 mg/L, which is higher than the average. At the re-release, it had a content below 150 mg/L so that the content does not need to be listed on the bottle.\n\nHowever, the new recipe was unpopular (as with New Coke). The mixture was again changed to taste more like the original one, the caffeine content was increased in 2005 to around 200 mg/L and caffeine was again listed as an ingredient on the label. This mixture was also not sufficiently successful and on April 1, 2006, the company finally changed back to the original recipe, with caffeine content of 250 mg/L.\n\nSince then, Afri-Cola has slightly regained market share.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Real Soda LLC, a U.S. company, started importing Afri-Cola into the United States, largely in the Seattle area. At the time, it was marketed as \"highest caffeine content allowed by law\" and positioned to compete with such high-caffeine colas as Jolt Cola and Fukola Cola. In the late 1990s, it was widely available at convenience stores and supermarkets in Seattle and is available in several cafes in Minneapolis. For a short time, it was available at the University of Rhode Island in their student union and at the University of Michigan at Backroom Pizza. In the early 2000s, it was available in the Reed College bookstore. Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG itself exports Afri-Cola to Austria, France, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.\nAfri-Cola was re-launched into the USA in May 2017 on the West Coast and in the New York area through importer Classic Beverage Imports working with various distributors. The USA product is in the same original high-caffeine formula and is sold in a 330ml version (11.2oz) of the iconic Afri-Cola glass bottle.\n\n"}

The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally.\n\nThe sausages are called \"cervelas\" in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, \"Cervelat\" in the German-speaking part, and \"servelat\" in the Italian-speaking part. The terms ultimately derive from \"cerebrum\", the Latin word for brain, which was used in early recipes. The term \"Cervelat\" is the oldest of the three. It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from \"zervelada\", a Milanese dialect word meaning a \"large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains.\" Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose towards the end of the 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe.\n\nThe taste of the sausages depends on the region, but generally they are similar to that of a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry cervelat are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of cervelat. In the United States, the term \"Thuringer sausage\" is used for a type of cervelat, rather than Thuringian sausage in the European sense.\n\nIn Switzerland, cervelats are cooked (slightly smoked and then boiled) or served raw. They contain a mixture of beef, bacon and pork rind. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines.\n\nThe cervelat is often referred to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 cervelats per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage.\nSwiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, curing salt and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants. A cervelat may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams.\n\nSwiss cervelats are prepared and eaten cooked or raw. They are boiled, grilled or fried. They can also be served uncooked, either in a salad or with bread and mustard.\n\nSometimes sold smoked and uncooked, cervelat can be seasoned, salted and cold smoked for one day.\n\nTraditionally, Swiss beef intestines were used for the casings, but towards the end of the 20th century, local cattle producers lost interest in cleaning and preparing them, so meat processors switched to Brazilian zebu intestines, which are not fatty and do not easily split open when roasted. However, beginning on 1 April 2006, the European Union banned the import of many animal parts from Brazil as a measure aimed at preventing the spread of mad cow disease. Among these were beef intestines. Although Switzerland is not an EU member state, it is bound to observe European food protection laws through other treaty agreements. Hence, Swiss and German stockpiles of zebu intestines became very low by 2008, threatening production altogether, and causing some controversy in Switzerland. In January of that year, the Swiss meat industry announced that a national \"cervelat task force\" had failed in an exhaustive search for an acceptable alternative to zebu intestines.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" noted that \"the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people.\" The cervelat production crisis was covered closely by the Swiss media and in a newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the \"\"cervelas\", as they knew it, had to be saved.\" The cervelat crisis was brought up in a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor and president of the Swiss Meat Association, Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage's social significance, calling it a \"cult sausage\" and \"the worker's steak\". The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebu intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil hoping to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease.\n\nBy August 2008, most of the Swiss demand for bovine intestines had been met with imports from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.\n\nCervelas de Lyon are a sausage specialty of Lyonnaise cuisine. They contain finely minced pork, and either truffles or pistachios. Sold uncooked, the sausage has to be boiled before it is eaten.\n\nIn Alsatian cuisine, \"cervelas d'Alsace\" are split open and served with cheese (gruyere) and bacon.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Jagdwurst contains about 20 percent fat.\n\nIn the regions of the former GDR (eastern Germany), a common dish is sliced Jagdwurst coated in breadcrumbs (normally mixed with egg) and fried, often in butter. Jagdwurst in this form is called \"Jägerschnitzel\" (\"Hunter's schnitzel\") and should not be confused with Schnitzel Jäger-Art, veal schnitzel served with dark mushroom sauce.\n\nJagdwurst can also be served on fresh buttered bread or breakfast rolls with a hint of mustard. Construction workers in Germany would carry a pocket knife with their lunch box, which contained a small roll of Jagdwurst, buttered bread slices and German mustard and perhaps even beer.

The Japanese variety of bread crumbs is called \"panko\".\n\nDry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture. Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a food processor, using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A grater or similar tool will also do.\n\nThe breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The \"crumb\" of \"bread crumb\" also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or \"skin\".\n\n is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as \"tonkatsu\". \"Panko\" is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb. It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating. Outside Japan, its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in Asian markets, speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large supermarkets.\n\n\"Panko\" is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, China, and Vietnam.\n\nThe Japanese first learned to make bread from Europeans. The word \"panko\" is derived from \"pan\", the word for bread in Portuguese and Japanese, and \"-ko\", a Japanese suffix indicating \"flour\", \"coating\", \"crumb\", or \"powder\" (as in \"komeko\", \"rice powder\", \"sobako\", \"buckwheat flour\", and \"komugiko\", \"wheat flour\").\n\nBreading (also known as crumbing) is a dry grain-derived food coating for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for frying as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, flour, cornmeal, and seasoning that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with buttermilk, raw egg, egg wash or other liquid.\n\nBreading contrasts with batter, which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.\n\nIn the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel, breadcrumbs were used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale lead to the inspiration the name \"breadcrumb\" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.\n"}

The same term was applied to their many languages.\n\nReworking the mythology in the late 1920s, Tolkien applied the word only to those Elves (later called Sindar) who lived in Beleriand and were ruled by King Thingol:\n\n\"In the course of ages the tongues and dialects of Beleriand became altogether estranged from those of other Eldar in Valinor, through the learned in such lore may perceive that they were anciently sprung from Telerin.

It is a traditional pastry of many European countries, and also a popular snack and dessert in Japan. The characteristic rings, which resemble tree rings when sliced, give the cake its German name, \"Baumkuchen\", which literally translates to \"tree cake\".\n\nThe origins of baumkuchen are a matter of controversy. The State of Bavaria claims that baumkuchen has been created since at least the 19th century in Bavaria. Another line of thought suggests that this cake had its beginnings as a Hungarian wedding cake, that is, a derivative of the oldest Hungarian pastry kürtőskalács (chimney cake). Then, in \"Ein new Kochbuch\" (literally \"A New Cookbook\"), published in 1581, the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt, a recipe for baumkuchen is to be found. Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia. In 1682, a rural medic working for Johann Sigismund Elsholtz prepared a similar dessert.\n\nAside from the above mentioned recent history, baumkuchen was already known in Ancient Greece and the latter Rome. The Roman conquerors brought the method for baking cakes on logs over an open fire to what is today Germany and its surroundings.\n\nThis labor-intensive, and thus rather expensive, specialty is made on a spit by evenly brushing on thin layers of batter, then rotating the spit over a heat source, traditionally a wood fire. Each layer is allowed to dry before another layer of batter is poured over the previous. When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the growth rings on a crosscut tree. A typical baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter. What is more, the method involved in creating the baumkuchen allows the cakes to become quite large: skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over 100 pounds. When cooked on a spit, it is not uncommon for a finished baumkuchen to be 3 to 4 feet tall.\n\nBaumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour. Baking powder is not considered a traditional ingredient. The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of flour, 100 grams of butter, and 200 grams of eggs). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling. Additionally, baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate glaze. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled baumkuchen is first coated with marmalade or jam, and then covered with chocolate.\n\nBaumkuchenspitzen, German for \"tree cake tips\", are miniature versions of baumkuchen that are created from the cake when it is cut in slices and then into pieces that are referred to as \"Spitzen\". These pieces are typically coated in chocolate and sold individually.\n\nA simpler horizontally layered version of the cake is called a \"Schichttorte\". It is baked without a spit, which results in horizontal layers instead of circular rings. The Schichttorte is more like a conventional cake in shape and can be baked in a conventional home oven that has a broiler inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average home. Compared to the spit variant, the Schichttorte's cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings.\n\nBaumkuchen is one of the most popular pastries in Japan, where it is called . It is a popular return present in Japan for wedding guests because of its typical ring shape.\n\nIt was first introduced to Japan by the German Karl Joseph Wilhelm Juchheim. Juchheim was in the Chinese city of Tsingtao during World War I when Britain and Japan laid siege to Tsingtao. He and his wife were then interned at Okinawa. Juchheim started making and selling the traditional confection at a German exhibition in Hiroshima in 1919. After the war, he chose to remain in Japan. Continued success allowed him to move to Yokohama and open a bakery, but its destruction in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused him to move his operations to Kobe, where he stayed until the end of World War II. Some years later, his wife returned to help a Japanese company open a chain of bakeries under the Juchheim name that further helped spread baumkuchen's popularity in Japan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1282970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1282970", "title": "Sopaipilla", "text": "Sopaipilla\n\nA sopaipilla, sopapilla, sopaipa, or cachanga is a kind of fried pastry and a type of quick bread served in several regions with Spanish heritage in the Americas. The word sopaipilla is the diminutive of sopaipa, a word that entered Spanish from the Mozarabic language of Al-Andalus. The original Mozarabic word \"Xopaipa\" was used to mean bread soaked in oil, and derived in turn from the Germanic word \"suppa\" which meant bread soaked in liquid.\n\nA sopaipilla is traditionally made from leavened wheat dough (or a mixture of wheat flour and masa harina) to which some shortening or butter is added. After being allowed to rise, the dough is rolled into a sheet that is then cut into circular, square or triangular shapes. The shapes are 8–10 cm in size for the longest dimension (if intended for a dessert) or 15–20 cm (if intended to be stuffed for a main course). The shapes are then deep-fried in oil, sometimes after allowing them to rise further before frying: the frying causes the shapes to puff up, ideally forming a hollow pocket in the center.\n\nIn Argentina, pastry is known under other names apart from sopaipa, supaipa and sopaipilla; other names include Torta frita, Kreppel, and \"chipá cuerito\".\n\nIn Chile, sopaipillas (or sopaipas) are known to have been eaten at least since 1726. Although Traditional Chilean sopaipillas (made in the central part of Chile) include cooked ground pumpkin in their dough, this is typically not the case in the South of Chile. Depending if they are served as a pastry or bread Chilean sopaipillas are traditionally served with either pebre (a sauce of chili pepper, onion, garlic and coriander) or boiled in \"chancaca\" sauce (a homemade hot syrup cooked with panela, orange peel and cinnamon, and then they are called \"sopaipillas pasadas\"). They are also served with mustard, ketchup, hot butter, avocado, cheese or manjar. In Chile sopaipillas are traditionally homemade and eaten during days of heavy rain, as well as enjoying widespread popularity as street food. Chilean sopaipillas are round and flat, sporting holes pricked through the centre of the dough, usually by a fork.\n\nIn Chiloé Archipelago and neighbor zones, sopaipillas have rhomboid form, they are usually sweet and served with jam or honey. They are a relevant ingredient in \"reitimientos\", a traditional feast related to rendering fats after a pig slaughter.\n\nIn Peru, the name for this fried pastry is \"cachanga\", and it may be either sweet or sour. Generally prepared during breakfast time, this traditional food of the Peruvian cuisine is prepared differently depending on the region, with one of the recipes involving the usage of cinnamon. The main difference between this form of sopaipilla and the other versions is that they are larger, thinner, and more rigid.\n\nSopapillas in New Mexican cuisine are distinct from Latin American sopapaillas. New Mexican sopapillas are pillow-shaped fried pastry dough. They are typically served as a bread, and used to mop up sauces, scoop up tidbits, or shredded into stews. They often serve as a quick meal in themselves, filled with savory ingredients such as ground beef. They are sometimes eaten as a dessert, drizzled with honey or anise syrup. but are often eaten this same way during the meal itself as New Mexican cuisine tends to be very spicy and sweet syrups reduce the sensations of heat.\n\nSopapillas in Tex-Mex cuisine are similar to New Mexican-style sopapillas, except that they are always served as a dessert item, coated with cinnamon sugar and served with honey. Many Tex-Mex restaurants in Oklahoma and Texas will serve dessert sopapillas as part of the complimentary \"set-up\": chips and salsa served before the meal, along with sometimes queso sauce, pickled vegetables and flour tortillas and sopapillas served at the end of the meal.\n\nSopaipilla and strudel were together designated as Texas' state pastries from 2003 to 2005. This style of sopapilla was introduced by Joe V. Carvajal.\n\nIn Uruguay, a variant of the Sopaipilla is known as Torta frita. Tortas fritas made in Uruguay are stretched into a thin large shaped dough. They are usually salty, but it is a common custom to cover them with sugar and eat them as a snack.\nThey are commonly prepared on rainy days.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1285104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1285104", "title": "Grape-Nuts", "text": "Grape-Nuts\n\nGrape-Nuts is a breakfast cereal developed in 1897 by C. W. Post, a former patient and later competitor of the 19th-century breakfast food innovator, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. The cereal originally prepared by C. W. Post when developing the product was a batter that came from the oven as a rigid sheet. He then broke the sheet into pieces and ran them through a coffee grinder to produce the \"nut\"-sized kernels.\n\nDespite the name, the cereal contains neither grapes nor nuts; it is made with wheat and barley. Post believed that glucose (which he called \"grape sugar\") formed in the baking process. This, combined with the nutty flavor of the cereal, is said to have inspired its name. Another explanation originates from employees at Post, who claim that the cereal got its name due to a resemblance to grape seeds, or grape \"nuts\".\n\nGrape-Nuts was initially marketed as a natural cereal that could enhance health and vitality, and as a \"food for brain and nerve centres.\" Its lightweight and compact nature, nutritional value, and resistance to spoilage made it a popular food for exploration and expedition groups in the 1920s and 1930s. In World War II, Grape-Nuts was a component of the lightweight jungle ration used by some U.S. and Allied Forces in wartime operations before 1944.\n\nA 1939 ad campaign by cartoonist Walter Hoban continued his \"Jerry on the Job\" comic strip in \"Woman's Day\" magazine and daily newspaper comics pages. General Foods also marketed Grape-Nuts through a comics-style advertising campaign (a trailblazer in this regard) featuring a character named Little Alby, who gained inordinate strength after consuming a bowl of Grape-Nuts.\n\nDuring the 1940s, comic books from various companies featured one-page comic-strip ads starring \"Volto from Mars\", a finned red helmet-clad alien superhero visiting Earth, who like all Martians, recharged his magnetic powers (his left hand repels, his right attracts) by eating \"cereal grains\", with him quickly developing a particular fondness for Grape-Nuts Flakes which he proclaimed \"the best I ever tasted!\"\n\nIn the 1960s, advertising promoted Grape-Nuts as the cereal that \"fills you up, not out\". Brand users, particularly mother/daughter look-alikes, were shown engaged in fitness activities such as tennis, horseback riding, skiing, and swimming. Also appearing during the \"fills you up, not out\" campaign were Andy Griffith and Don Knotts as the characters from \"The Andy Griffith Show\", Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife.\n\nThis ad campaign produced one television commercial, which aired on television in 1968, that featured a catchphrase that became a target for numerous sketches and satires in media. Spanning the ensuing two decades and beyond, \"Oh no, Mrs. Burke! I thought you were Dale!\" was parodied on television variety show sketches, in the film \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\" and in many \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" episodes, fans continue to discuss the origin of this \"riff\" and have even developed products that feature the text, \"I thought you were Dale.\"\n\nA subsequent ad campaign generated another catchphrase, as Euell Gibbons became the spokesperson for the brand, promoting Grape-Nuts as the \"Back to Nature Cereal\". The line \"Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible\" drew attention to the product from consumers, as well as from comedians.\n\nGrape-Nuts is credited as the first widespread product to use a coupon in sales promotion when C.W. Post Company offered a penny-off coupon to get people to try their cereal in the late 1890s.\n\nUntil recent years, Grape-Nuts packaging set it apart from other cereals, in that no sealed film bag was used. It was sold in the usual \"tombstone\" cardboard box; rather than featuring lightly glued flaps at the top which could be separated to open the top face completely, perforations could be broken to form a small opening for pouring, near the intersection of one of the narrow side faces and the top surface.\n\nAt one time, Grape-Nuts was the seventh-most popular cold breakfast cereal, but sales declined as Post was sold from one company to another. Around 2005, it held less than 1% of the market. About this time, the formula was changed; the husks from milled grain were ground into the flour and the cereal was pitched as \"whole grain\", albeit at the cost of roughening the cereal's texture and detracting significantly from mouth feel. The addition of vitamins and minerals allowed it to qualify for food-stamp programs.\n\nModern-day Grape-Nuts contain whole grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, salt, and dried yeast as ingredients.\n\nGrape-Nut ice cream is a popular regional dish in the Canadian Maritimes, the Shenandoah Valley, Jamaica, and New England. One origin story is that it was created by chef Hannah Young at The Palms restaurant in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in 1919. She created it when she ran out of fresh fruit to add to ice cream, and decided to throw in some cereal. It proved popular at the restaurant and the Scotsburn Dairy company began mass-producing the ice cream variety, and it sold across the region. Variations of ice cream with Grape Nuts are also called brown bread ice cream. Other flavours with cereal include hazelnut syrup, chocolate, varieties of chocolate chips, mint, and other fresh flavors.\n\n\n\n"}

Those with negative emotions tend to eat unhealthy food in an effort to experience the instant gratification which resulted in good feeling — although only short-lived.\n\nOne study divided college-students' comfort-food identifications into four categories (nostalgic foods, indulgence foods, convenience foods, and physical comfort foods) with a special emphasis on the deliberate selection of particular foods to modify mood or effect, and indications that the medical-therapeutic use of particular foods may ultimately be a matter of mood-alteration.\n\nThe identification of particular items as comfort food may be idiosyncratic, though patterns are detectable. In one study of American preferences, \"males preferred warm, hearty, meal-related comfort foods (such as steak, casseroles, and soup) while females instead preferred comfort foods that were more snack related (such as chocolate and ice cream). In addition, younger people preferred more snack-related comfort foods compared to those over 55 years of age.\" The study also revealed strong connections between consumption of comfort foods and feelings of guilt. An article, \"The Myth of Comfort Food\" asserted that men tend to choose these types of savory comfort foods because they remind them of being \"pampered\" or spoiled, while women choose snack-related foods because they are associated with low amounts of work and less \"cleanup.\" It also suggested that women are more likely to reach for unhealthier foods in times of stress due to more weight-conscious mindsets.\n\nComfort food consumption has been seen as a response to emotional stress and, consequently, as a key contributor to the epidemic of obesity in the United States. The provocation of specific hormonal responses leading selectively to increases in abdominal fat is seen as a form of self-medication.\n\nFurther studies suggest that consumption of comfort food is triggered in men by positive emotions, and by negative ones in women. The stress effect is particularly pronounced among college-aged women, with only 33% reporting healthy eating choices during times of emotional stress. For women specifically, these psychological patterns may be maladaptive.\n\nA therapeutic use of these findings includes offering comfort foods or \"happy hour\" beverages to anorectic geriatric patients whose health and quality of life otherwise decreases with reduced oral intake.\n\nA partial list by country of comfort foods around the world.\n\nComfort foods in Australia and New Zealand may include:\n\nBritish comfort foods include the following foods:\n\nSome popular Indonesian foods are considered to be comfort food, usually served hot or warm, and soupy or with a soft texture. Most of them are high in carbs or fat, such as fried rice, congee, and noodles which are high in carbs; while meatballs and grilled skewered meats contains fair amount of fat and salt. Comfort foods often are the kind of food that provides nostalgic sentiments, as they often called \"masakan rumahan\" (home cooking) or \"masakan ibu\" (mother's dishes). In Indonesia, the warm and soft texture of bubur ayam is believed to help people to recover during convalescence. Sayur sop or sup ayam is Indonesian chicken soup that often sought during flu. The warm soup contains chunk of chicken, bits of potato, carrot, and common green bean served in chicken stock.\n\nSome Indonesian comfort foods are traditional Indonesian food and some are derived from Chinese influences. For some Indonesians, especially those who are abroad, comfort food might also be a certain brand or type of Indonesian instant noodle, such as Indomie Mi goreng.

It consists of simple sugars, protein, minerals and vitamins, fatty acids, and a small percentage of other components. Also called bee bread, or ambrosia, it is stored in brood cells, mixed with saliva, and sealed with a drop of honey. Bee pollen is harvested as food for humans, with various health claims, one of them being that the fermentation process makes it much more potent than simple flower pollen.\n\nPollen balls are stored in the chambers of honeybee hives, and sometimes in wood and mud created by female ground-nesting bees, such as the leafcutting bee. With the leafcutting bee, when the pollen ball is complete, a single female lays an egg on top of the pollen ball, and seals the brood cell. It differs from field gathered pollen as honey bee secretions induce a fermentation process, where biochemical transformations break down the walls of flower pollen grains and render the nutrients more readily available.\n\nForager bees that gather pollen do not eat it themselves, since they stop producing the proteolytic enzymes necessary to digest it when they transition to foraging. The foragers unload the pollen they gather directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called bee bread – the substance which is the main food source for honey bee larvae and workers.\n\nForaging bees bring pollen back to the hive, where they pass it off to other worker bees, who pack the pollen into cells with their heads. During collection and possibly packing, the pollen is mixed with nectar and bee salivary secretions. Bee pollen is the primary source of protein for the hive. This method of packing can be seen in the bee species \"Xylocopa sulcatipes\" and \"Xylocopa varipuncta\".\n\nLike honey and propolis, other well-known honey bee products that are gathered rather than secreted (i.e., in contrast to royal jelly and beeswax), the exact chemical composition depends on the plants the worker bees gather the pollen from, and can vary from hour to hour, day to day, week to week, colony to colony, even in the same apiary, with no two samples of bee pollen exactly identical. Accordingly, chemical and nutritional analyses of bee pollen apply only to the specific samples being tested, and cannot be extrapolated to samples gathered in other places or other times. Although there is no specific chemical composition, the average composition is said to be 40–60% simple sugars (fructose and glucose), 20–60% proteins, 3% minerals and vitamins, 1–32% fatty acids, and 5% diverse other components. A study of bee pollen samples showed that they may contain 188 kinds of fungi and 29 kinds of bacteria. Despite this microbial diversity, stored pollen (also called bee bread) is a preservation environment similar to honey, and contains consistently low microbial biomass.\n\nBee pollen has been touted by herbalists as a treatment for a variety of medical conditions, but there is no good evidence that bee pollen has any health benefits other than as a source of nutrition. Potential risks of consuming bee pollen include contamination by fungal mycotoxins, pesticides, or toxic metals. Bee pollen is safe for short term use, but for those with pollen allergies, allergic reactions may occur (shortness of breath, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis). Bee pollen is not safe for pregnant women and should not be used during breastfeeding. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the use of some bee pollen products because they are adulterated with unapproved drugs including sibutramine and phenolphthalein.\n\n"}

Pinnekjøtt is a festive dish typical to Western- and Northern Norway, and is rapidly gaining popularity in other regions as well. This dish is largely associated with the celebration of Christmas, served with puréed swede, a.k.a. mashed rutabaga, and potatoes, beer and akevitt. 37% of Norwegians say they eat pinnekjøtt for their family Christmas dinner. An ongoing discussion is the use of the Norwegian word \"ribbe\" as the eastern part of Norway use the name \"ribbe\" for meat of pig ribs, while the western part of Norway use the name \"ribbe\" on ribs of sheep.\n\nThe preparation of pinnekjøtt uses a traditional method for food preservation utilizing curing, drying and in some regions also smoking as means of inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms. Although lamb is today available fresh or frozen all year round, pinnekjøtt is still prepared both commercially and in private homes due to the flavour and maturing the preservation process gives to the meat. In home preparation of pinnekjøtt, racks of lamb or mutton are cured in brine or coarse sea salt. Once sufficiently cured, and when the weather is cold enough, the racks are hung in a cool, dark, well ventilated place to dry. In some regions, particularly in parts of Hordaland, the fresh racks are smoked prior to curing. Traditionally this was done in order to prevent mold growth during the drying process. It was also a way that the Vikings used when transporting meat across long distances. This technique is still being used today in some countries during transport.\n\nBefore cooking, the racks are separated into individual ribs by cutting a sharp knife between the bones. The ribs must then be soaked in water in order to rinse out the salt and reconstitute the meat. Today pinnekjøtt is available in most supermarkets before Christmas, smoked or unsmoked, ready cut and sometimes also soaked, ready for cooking.\n\nAfter soaking the ribs are steamed over a little water in a large saucepan. A layer of twigs from the birch tree may be placed in the bottom of the saucepan instead of a metal steamer. The name \"pinnekjøtt\" (literally: \"stick meat\") is disputed. It may refer to the birch twigs of the cooking process, but the word 'pinne' is in dialectal Norwegian also used in reference to single ribs – akin to \"rib sticks\", a dialectal expression in English.\n\nIn the Netflix Original series \"Lady Dynamite\" (2017), Season 2 Episode 5 \"\"Souplutions\",\" Maria's mother makes \"pinnekjøtt\" for the king and queen of Norway.\n\n\n"}

Mello Yello Cherry was released in response to Mountain Dew Code Red. The other two variants were Mello Yello Afterglow (peach-flavored) and Mello Yello Melon. All three were only available for a limited time. Mello Yello Cherry is available at Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, and is still available in limited markets.\n\nIn April 2010, Coca-Cola announced new images of new packaging that it would be re-branding Mello Yello to resemble the packaging in 1979. This re-branding has included an expanded distribution of the product, into such areas of the United States that have not had the product in years such as the Northeastern United States and the Western United States. In 2011, Mello Yello began to replace Vault on Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\n\nMello Yello was featured in the 1990 NASCAR-based movie \"Days of Thunder\", in which Tom Cruise's character, Cole Trickle, drove a Mello Yello-sponsored car to victory in the Daytona 500, although the product name itself is never verbally mentioned in the movie. That livery went on to become a real NASCAR paint scheme the following year, when driver Kyle Petty drove with Mello Yello sponsorship in the Winston Cup Series. He ran four seasons (1991–1994) with the sponsor before switching over to Coors Light in 1995. Mello Yello was seen as a sponsor on die-cast toy and collectible cars for both the Days of Thunder #51 Chevrolet Lumina and Kyle Petty's #42 Pontiac Grand Prix. Mello Yello also sponsored the fall Winston Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway through 1994.\n\nMello Yello was also advertised in the Nashville-based Ernest commercials in which he coined the beverage's official slogan \"Make The Mello Yello Move\", followed by his trademark phrase, \"Knowhutimean?\"\n\nIn 1982, arcade manufacturer Gottlieb created but never released an edition of their successful arcade game Q*Bert with Mello Yello livery in-play as well as proposed cabinet artwork. The game has been preserved and is playable on the MAME arcade emulator.\n\nIn 2011, Mello Yello relaunched its ad campaign. The commercial featured cartoon adults who boarded a boat and made a band, singing \"Mellow Yellow\".\n\nIn 2013, Mello Yello became the title sponsor of the NHRA's professional drag racing circuit—the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series, as part of an extension of The Coca Cola Company's sponsorship. Fellow Coca-Cola brands Powerade and Full Throttle had previously served as title sponsors. \n\nIn December 2015, Mello Yello unveiled a new logo and packaging design, featuring a new stylized \"MY\" emblem in black on yellow. This logo was only used for the regular variant and the Mello Yello Zero. Mello Yello Cherry and Peach continued to use the previous logo until 2017.\n\nIn October 2006, Mello Yello was relaunched in New Zealand as a 'limited edition' product after an absence of at least 15 years from the local market. The relaunched New Zealand version contained the original 1980s logo, and as when it was available in the 1980s included the words \"A Product of the Coca-Cola Company\" on the bottle top. This 'limited edition' release was available in 600 ml and 1.5 litre plastic bottles and contained the words \"Limited Edition\". Only 200,000 cases of the promo product were produced in 2006 according to Coca Cola.

In Australia, the Mello Yello brand has returned during the 2012–2013 summer, with a 1980s era logo being used. In small type, the packaging says, \"Mello Yello presented by Lift\"; however, the contents are not Lift. Lift is also available in 1990s-themed packaging. This Mello Yello is not caffeinated. It is notable that Mountain Dew in Australia had not been caffeinated until about six months prior to this release.

The word comes from \"Lobscouse\", a stew commonly eaten by sailors throughout northern Europe, which became popular in seaports such as Liverpool.\n\n\"The Oxford Companion to Food\" claims that lobscouse \"almost certainly has its origins in the Baltic ports, especially those of Germany\". Similar dishes are traditional in countries around the North Sea, such as Norway (\"lapskaus\"), Sweden (), Denmark (\"\" meaning \"skipper's lobscouse\") and northern Germany (\"Labskaus\"). Another theory posits a Low German origin from \"lappen\" (dewlap) and \"kaus\" (bowl).\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), \"scouse\" is a shortened form of \"lobscouse\" and has also been written \"lopscourse\", \"lobscourse\", \"lobskous\", \"lobscouce\" and \"lap's course\". Its oldest quote is from 1707, by the satirist Edward Ward: \"He has sent the Fellow..to the Devil, that first invented Lobscouse.\".\n\nThe first known use of the term \"lobscouse\" is dated 1706, according to \"Webster's Dictionary\". Tobias Smollet refers to \"lob's course\" in 1750. The roots of the word are unknown. \n\nThe \"OED\" states that the origin is unknown, and goes on to compare the word to \"loblolly\", which means a \"[t]hick gruel or spoon-meat, frequently referred to as a rustic or nautical dish or simple medicinal remedy; burgoo\" and \"perhaps [is] onomatopoeic: compare the dialectal lob ‘to bubble while in process of boiling, said esp. of porridge’, also ‘to eat or drink up noisily’\".\n\nFriedrich Kluge also states that the origin of lobscouse is unknown, and that it was loaned to German in the 19th century where it was called \"labskaus\". Hjalmar Falk and Alf Torp states that \"lobscous\" originally was \"lob's course\" from a lob (a lump) and course (a dish) and that the word has travelled to Norwegian as \"labskaus\" and Danish as \"lobskous\".\n\nThe similarities with \"labs kauss\" in Latvian and \"labas kaušas\" is called gobbledygook (\"Kauderwelsch\") of the mind in Der Spiegel by Petra Foede. Foede translates \"Labs kausis\" to means a \"good plate\" in Latvian, and says that in Lithuanian they use \"labas káuszas\" for a \"good plate\". According to Gerhard Bauer \"káuszas\" in Lithuanian means a wooden ladle or dipper or a wooden drinking bowl and is the same word as Lettish \"kauśis\" and this baltic word have been adopted in German as \"Kausche\" or \"Kauszel\" which means wooden jug, pitcher or drinking bowl.\n\nNineteenth-century sailors made lobscouse by boiling salted meat, onions and pepper, with ship's biscuit used to thicken the dish. Modern English scouse resembles the Norwegian stew \"lapskaus\", although it differs from the German \"labskaus\" which is similar to Hash. Scouse is a stew, similar to Lancashire hotpot, usually of mutton, lamb (often neck) or beef with vegetables, typically potatoes, carrots and onions. It is commonly served with pickled beetroot or pickled red cabbage and bread.\n\nScouse is strongly associated with Liverpool, where it remains popular and is a staple of local pub and café menus, although recipes vary greatly and often include ingredients which are inconsistent with the thrifty roots of the dish. \"Scouse\" has become part of a genre of slang terms which refer to people by stereotypes of their dietary habits, e.g. limey, \"rosbif\" (for the English), Frogs (for the French) and Kraut (for Germans).\n\nIn St. Helens, the dish is often called \"lobbies\" and uses corned beef as the meat. In Wigan \"lobbies\" is often made using tinned stewing steak as the meat. A further variety of the dish is \"blind Scouse\", made without meat, although it would likely have used cheap \"soup bones\" for flavouring the broth (prior to WW2, such meat bones could be sold to bone dealers after being used and for the same price as originally purchased from the butcher ). The dish is also popular in Leigh with local residents sometimes being referred to as 'Lobbygobblers'.\n\nA variant, \"lobscaws\" or \"lobsgaws\", is a traditional dish in North Wales, normally made with braising or stewing steak, potatoes and any other vegetable available; when made with mutton, it is known as \"cawl\". The food was traditionally regarded as food for farmers and the working-class people of North Wales, but is now popular as a dish throughout Wales. The recipe was brought by the canal barges to Stoke-on-Trent, where it is called \"lobby\", a shortened version of \"lobscouse\".\n\n"}

It is a bar dessert which requires no baking and is named after the city of Nanaimo, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. It consists of three layers: a wafer and coco nut crumb base, custard flavoured butter icing in the middle and a layer of chocolate ganache on top. Many varieties exist, consisting of different types of crumb, different flavours of icing (e.g., mint, peanut butter, coconut, mocha), and different types of chocolate.\n\nThe earliest confirmed printed copy of the recipe using the name \"Nanaimo bars\" appears in the Edith Adams' prize cookbook (14th edition) from 1953. A copy of the book is on view at the Nanaimo Museum. However, following research into the origins of Nanaimo bars, Lenore Newman writes that the same recipe was published in the \"Vancouver Sun\" earlier that same year under the name \"London Fog Bar\". The recipe later also appears in a publication entitled \"His/Her Favourite Recipes, Compiled by the Women's Association of the Brechin United Church\" (1957), with the recipe submitted by Joy Wilgress, a Baltimore, Maryland, native. (Brechin United Church is in Nanaimo.)\n\nIn 1954 the recipe \"Mabel's Squares\" was published in \"The Country Woman's Favorite\" by the Upper Gloucester Women's Institute (New Brunswick). The recipe was submitted by Mrs. Harold Payne, the daughter of Mabel (Knowles) Scott (1883-1957). The ingredients list, quantities, and fabrication closely match the recipe found on the City of Nanaimo's website.\n\nThe first printing of recipes featuring Nanaimo bar ingredients is found in the 1952 \"Women's Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cookbook\", which features three nearly identical recipes that differ only slightly from the modern Nanaimo bar. They are referred to as the \"chocolate square\" or the \"chocolate slice\".\n\nOther unconfirmed references date the bar back to the 1930s, when it was said to be known locally as \"chocolate fridge cake\". One modern reference even refers to the bars' existing in nineteenth century Nanaimo.\n\nThe popularity of the bar in Nanaimo led local residents to mobilise to have it voted \"Canada's Favourite Confection\" in a \"National Post\" reader survey. In 1985, Mayor Graeme Roberts initiated a contest to find the ultimate Nanaimo bar recipe. The recipe submitted by Joyce Hardcastle, a resident of Nanaimo, was unanimously selected by a panel of judges.\n\nRecipes for similar desserts are found in various places, under various names, in North America and Europe. The designation \"Nanaimo bar\" is Canadian, and appears in the \"Canadian Oxford Dictionary\", but not in other language or dialect versions.\n\nAn episode from the first season of \"MasterChef Canada\" featured an elimination challenge where competitors made desserts inspired by Nanaimo bars, chosen among three Canadian desserts.\n\nThe 2016 US state dinner in honour of Justin Trudeau featured Nanaimo bars. The elaborate dinner hosted by former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama consisted of a blend of American and Canadian dishes. The main dessert featured was Nanaimo bars, and was presented on a plate inspired by the Rocky Mountains. \n\n"}

It contains 33% fiber, 78% of natural wheat bran's 43%.\n\nAll-Bran Buds is similar with added psyllium; its 39% fiber analysis is close to that of natural wheat bran.\n\nDespite the name, the principal ingredient in All-Bran Flakes is whole grain wheat, not bran. It contains only 15% fiber, equivalent to 34% wheat bran.\n\nAll-Bran received five stars out of five on the Australian Government's health star ratings.\n\nAll-Bran comes in different varieties; many are available to specific countries:\n\n\n\n"}

There are three sizes made by the brand Flowboards: 32\", for tricks and smaller riders; 36\", the standard size; and 42\", the large downhill bomber.\n\nThe flowboard was created by Pieter Schouten and Mike Simonian, two design students attending the Art Center College of Design in Vevey, Switzerland. In 1993, they had the idea to develop a board that would perform like a snowboard, but on asphalt. They found that on a skateboard, a rider could only lean over a few degrees and then the bushings would give resistance in a turn. The two inventors sought a solution that would give a rider the ability to execute more extreme angles while carving without resistance, offering fluid transitions edge to edge. In 1994, Simonian asked Schouten to spend time developing their ideas in Simonian's native California.\n\nSchouten came up with a concept for a two-wheeled board with two curved axles with one wheel on each and springs on either side. The theory was that wheels would slide along the arced axles as the board leaned to carve. These \"arced axles\" became one of the key elements of the new board design. To allow the board to turn, the two men found that by mounting the axles at opposing angles, the wheels would go in a straight line when they were at the top of the arc and that when the wheels slid to either end of the arc they would have a curved relationship that would result in a turn. The \"angled axles\" would be the second key element of the new board design. The first prototype was produced in Simonian's parents' garage on El Arco Drive in Whittier, California. This location became the namesake of the \"El Arco Axles\".\n\nNumerous potential investors were approached including Powell Skateboards, Morey Boogie Board, pro-skater Rodney Mullen, Nike, Rollerblade and Mattel, but nothing developed from the discussions. In 1999, the two inventors formed Flowlab LLC alongside entrepreneur Phil Wessells. By the year 2000, the very first Flowboards were being shipped.\n\nIn 2003, Michael Kern(CEO of Sport Technology Inc.), then the company's largest distributor, purchased the company and a new headquarters in Long Beach, California was established. In 2005, Flowlab signed an exclusive distribution agreement with the skate wheel manufacturer Kryptonics to further expand its presence in general sporting goods channels.\n\nIn 2007, Michael Kern took his Company Public with FBC Holding Co.. A division of Capital One Inc., and was shut down unlawfully and has been seeking action against FBC Holding Inc. and Capital One Inc. to the current date.\n\nThe flowboard's design enables a 45 degree turning ability rather than the standard 25 degrees on a skateboard while still remaining stable.\n\nA flowboard tends to put pressure on just 2 wheels of the board, rather than 4. This more focused weight distribution requires slightly more effort into keeping the board moving. For this reason, it is often ideal to ride it on downhill slopes. Spacers can also be installed to reduce bearing compression caused by the trucks' arched structure and improve mobility.\n"}
